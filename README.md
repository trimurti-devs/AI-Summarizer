# AI-Summarizer
An AI system that automatically find outs the most important details from a paragraph or topic.


# Introduction
In an age where information is abundant and attention spans are dwindling, the ability to quickly distill essential insights from lengthy texts has become increasingly valuable. AI-Summarizer is an innovative tool designed to leverage artificial intelligence for automatic text summarization. This project aims to provide users with concise, coherent summaries of extensive documents, articles, and reports, thereby enhancing productivity and facilitating better information consumption.

# Features
  Automatic Summarization: The AI-Summarizer automatically processes input text and generates a concise summary.
  Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust various parameters to fine-tune the summarization process according to their needs.
  User -Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the tool is easy to use, requiring minimal setup.
  Performance Evaluation: Built-in scripts allow users to evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics.

# Installation
To get started with AI-Summarizer, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

# Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/trimurti-devs/AI-Summarizer.git
      cd AI-Summarizer
# Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Training the Model
To train the summarization model, execute the following command:

    python train_model.py
This script will prepare the data and initiate the training process. Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted as specified in the prepare_data.py script.

# Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using:

    python evaluate_model.py
This script will provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, helping you understand how well the model performs.

# Testing the Model
To test the model with sample data, run:

    python test.py
This will allow you to see the summarization results on predefined test cases.
