Filename,Abstract,Highlights
1,Standardized developmentally based assessment systems have transformed the capacity to identify transdiagnostic behavioral markers of mental disorder risk in early childhood notably clinically significant irritability and externalizing behaviors . However behavior based instruments that both differentiate risk for persistent psychopathology from normative misbehavior and are feasible for community clinicians to implement are in nascent phases of development . Young childrens facial expressions during frustration challenges may form the basis for novel assessments tools that are flexible quick and easy to implement as markers of psychopathology to complement validated questionnaires . However the accuracy of facial expressions to correctly classify young children falling above and below clinical cut offs is unknown . Our goal was to test how facial expressions during frustration defined by different facial muscular movements related to individual differences in irritability and externalizing behaviors and discriminated children with clinically significant levels from peers . Participants were 79 children who completed a short moderately frustrating computer task while facial expressions were recorded . Only negative facial expressions that included eye constriction related to irritability and externalizing behaviors and were clinically discriminating . Moreover these expressions significantly discriminated children with and without clinically significant irritability and externalizing symptoms with high Area Under the Curve values indicating good clinical utility . In contrast expressions without eye constriction showed no clinical utility . The presence of negative expressions with eye constriction in response to a short frustration prompt may serve as an indicator of early psychopathology raising the potential for novel assessment tools that may enhance precision of early identification .,There is a need for tools that assess child irritability and externalizing behaviors. We measured childrens facial muscular movement during a mildly frustrating task. Negative expressions with eye constriction predicted irritability and externalizing behaviors. These expressions classified clinical irritability and externalizing behaviors. Specific facial expressions may inform new diagnostic instruments for children
2,Given the prominence of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale in treatment outcome studies we conducted a critical examination of its internal consistency and relationship to other measures of irritability in 758 psychiatrically hospitalized youth with autism spectrum disorder . In exploratory and confirmation samples we conducted factor and bifactor analyses to describe the internal structure of the ABC I . Our results suggest that the ABC I roughly represents a unidimensional construct of irritability as indicated by a general factor in bifactor analysis . In addition to irritability subordinate factors are presented that represent tantrums verbal outbursts self harm and negative affect . Notably self harm items explain a large proportion of variance independent of irritability . Therefore their contribution in analyses of treatment effects should be considered . Further study or revision of the ABC I may improve convergent validity with transdiagnostic formulations of irritability as well as prevent confound from self harm in treatment studies for irritability in ASD,The Aberrant Behavioral Checklist Irritability Subscale is commonly used in clinical trials. Irritability is adequately measured by the ABC I with fair reliability. It has a complex internal structure with four separable components. The self harm component explains a large portion response variance independently of irritability.
3,Irritability is impairing in youth and is the core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder . Currently there are no established clinician rated instruments to assess irritability in pediatric research and clinical settings . Clinician rated measures ensure consistency of assessment across patients and are important specifically for treatment research . Here we present data on the psychometric properties of the Clinician Affective Reactivity Index the first semistructured interview focused on pediatric irritability . The CL ARI was administered to a transdiagnostic sample of 98 youth,The CL ARI is a clinician rated instrument that dimensionally assesses pediatric irritability. The instrument can be used to assess transdiagnostic irritability. The CL ARI consists of a temper outburst mood and impairment subscale. Psychometric properties of the CL ARI are examined. The CL ARI shows good criterion validity and reliability.
4,Cisplatin is widely used in the chemoradiotherapy of cervical cancers . However despite the severe systemic side effects the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin is often compromised by the development of drug resistance which is closely related to the elevated intracellular thiol containing species and the adenosine triphosphate dependent glutathione S conjugate pumps . The construction of a safe and redox sensitive nano sensitizer with high disulfide density and high Pt prodrug loading capacity as described herein is a promising way to overcome the cisplatin resistance and enhance the CRT efficacy . The optimized nanoparticles referred to as,Reduction sensitive nano carrier quantitatively encapsulated prodrug molecules. Prodrug nanomedicine greatly improved the safety profiles of cisplatin. Prodrug strategies overcame cisplatin resistance by GSH consumption and mitochondrial targeting. Prodrug nano sensitizer enabled efficient chemoradiotherapy in cisplatin resistant cancer model.
5,Mineralized enamel and dentin provide protection to the dental pulp which is vital tissue rich with cells vasculature and nerves in the inner tooth . Dental caries left untreated threaten exposure of the dental pulp providing facile access for bacteria to cause severe infection both in the pulp and systemically . Dental materials which stimulate the formation of a protective dentin bridge after insult are necessary to seal the pulp chamber in an effort to maintain natural dentition and prevent pulpal infection . Dental materials to date including calcium hydroxide paste mineral trioxide aggregate and glass ionomer resin are used with mixed results . Herein we exploited the cell cell communicative properties of exosomes extracellular vesicles derived from both mineralizing primary human dental pulp stem cells and an immortalized murine odontoblast cell line to catalyze the formation of a reactionary dentin bridge by recruiting endogenous stem cells of the dental pulp through an easy to handle delivery vehicle which allows for their therapeutic controlled delivery at the pulp interface . Exosomes derived from both hDPSCs and MDPCs upregulated odontogenic gene expression and increased mineralization,Exosomes from dental pulp stem cells and odontoblast cells upregulate odontogenic genes. Triblock copolymer is able to deliver exosomes with tunable dose and duration. Sustained exosome release induces dental pulp stem cell migration and dentin regeneration. Exosome loaded dental pulp capping materials facilitate dentin bridge formation and protect pulp tissue.
6,Amino acids have attracted considerable attention in drug development because they play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes . In the past several decades various amino acid supplementations have been reported to have potential therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of many disorders in clinical trials . However their effectiveness is controversially reported which may be explained by poor pharmacokinetic properties of such low molecular weight agents . Amino acid based self assembled macromolecules could overcome the aforementioned drawbacks by improving the pharmacokinetic profile and accumulation of specific molecules at target sites to enhance the therapeutic effect . In this review we have discussed the current therapeutic applications of certain amino acids and have introduced our approach of using amino acid based self assembled nanostructures as novel therapeutic agents .,A landscape of amino acid therapeutics is overviewed.

9,Peri prosthetic joint infections are a serious adverse event following joint replacement surgeries antibiotics are usually added to bone cement to prevent infection offset . For uncemented prosthesis alternative antimicrobial approaches are necessary in order to prevent PJI however despite elution of drug from the surface of the device being shown one of the most promising approach no effective antimicrobial eluting uncemented device is currently available on the market . Consequently there is a clinical need for non antibiotic antimicrobial uncemented prosthesis as these devices present numerous benefits particularly for young patients over cemented artificial joints . Moreover non antibiotic approaches are driven by the need to address the growing threat posed by antibiotic resistance .,Multilayer coatings containing chlorhexidine were deposited on titanium. Chlorhexidine release was sustained for up to 8weeks. Coatings exhibited antimicrobial activity against numerous pathogens. No adverse effects were detected in in vitro and in vivo experiments.
10,The occurrence of an implant associated infection with the formation of a persisting bacterial biofilm remains a major risk following orthopedic biomaterial implantation . Yet progress in the fabrication of tunable and durable implant coatings with sufficient bactericidal activity to prevent IAI has been limited . Here an electrospun composite coating was optimized for the combinatorial and sustained delivery of antibiotics . Antibiotics laden poly and poly 1q nanofibers were electrospun onto lattice structured titanium implants . In order to achieve tunable and independent delivery of vancomycin and rifampicin we investigated the influence of the specific drug polymer interaction and the nanofiber coating composition on the drug release profile and durability of the polymer Ti interface . We found that a bi layered nanofiber structure produced by electrospinning of an inner layer of and an outer layer of yielded the optimal combinatorial drug release profile . This resulted in markedly enhanced bactericidal activity against planktonic and adherent,Bi layered electrospun nanofibers applied onto titanium implants to obtain a sustained release profile. Co delivery of Rifampicin and Vancomycin demonstrated a combinatorial bactericidal activity. The nanofiber filled lattice strategy resulted in a durable coating after surgical implantation.

14,Adjuvants that contain pathogen associated molecular patterns can enhance vaccination efficacy by binding to pattern recognition receptors thereby stimulating immune responses . Particularly effective may be the combination of multiple PAMPs that activate different PRRs which occurs with natural pathogens . Here we hypothesized the enhanced effects would occur in two adjuvants that stimulate different PRRs CpG oligodeoxynucleotide which is Toll like receptor 9 agonist and 5 triphosphate short double stranded RNA which activates retinoic acid inducible gene I . The model antigen ovalbumin was loaded and adjuvants were surface adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles by electrostatic interaction with an average size of 120nm and a negative surface charge for targeting lymph nodes . These nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by antigen presenting cells in the lymph nodes and the resulting APC activation and antigen cross presentation generated strong humoral immunity and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and IFN secretion . NP 3pRNA CpG significantly suppressed B16 OVA tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice in therapeutic and prophylactic models illustrating the enhanced effects of CpG ODN and 3pRNA . Our study highlights the potential of combining multiple adjuvants for effective vaccine design .,Nano sized aluminum hydroxide combined two adjuvants NP 3pRNA CpG for activating different pattern recognition receptors.

15,For type 2 diabetic patients short acting glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist is often prescribed with frequent needled injections . Long acting GLP 1 RA for less frequent injections do not mimic physiologic secretion of GLP 1 . Therefore an implantable pump is proposed in this work which can deliver a short acting GLP 1 RA exenatide without needles and batteries . The implanted pump can infuse an accurate amount of exenatide bolus only when a noninvasive magnetic force is applied from outside the body . The pump includes a safety feature of patterned magnets for actuation to prevent accidental infusion possibly caused by a general household magnet . The reservoir for exenatide is made of a flexible biomaterial and thus a negative pressure build up in the reservoir can be prevented even after multiple actuations and almost all drug consumption . This allows a reproducible drug dose for a longer period after implantation hence less frequent replenishment procedures . The pump is also equipped with an intermediate container with two distinct check valves and thus the reservoir of exenatide can be further separated and better prevented from infiltration of the bodily fluid surrounding the implanted pump . When tested in Goto Kakizaki rats the pump demonstrates the efficacy of exenatide similar to conventional subcutaneous injections . Therefore the pump can be promising for patient friendly optimal delivery of short acting GLP 1 RA that better follows the physiologic secretion profile of GLP 1 .,An implantable magnetic pump can deliver an accurate dose of exenatide. The pump works noninvasively by a magnet with a specific polarity pattern. A reproducible dose can be obtained until almost all drug consumption in the pump. Exenatide can be replenished after pump implantation hence semi permanent use. The pump shows in vivo efficacy of exenatide similar to conventional injections.
16,Many high affinity peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX have been reported as activators of the tumor suppressor protein p53 with therapeutic potential . Unfortunately peptide activators of p53 generally suffer poor proteolytic stability and low membrane permeability posing a major pharmacological challenge to anticancer peptide drug development .

17,To improve therapeutic efficacy of nanocarrier drug delivery systems it is essential to improve their uptake and penetration in tumour tissue enhance cellular uptake and ensure efficient drug release at the tumour site . Here we introduce a tumour targeting drug delivery system based on the ultrasound mediated delivery of enzyme sensitive liposomes . These enzyme sensitive liposomes are coated with cleavable poly which will be cleaved by two members of the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase family . Cleavage of the PEG coat can increase cellular uptake and will destabilize the liposomal membrane which can result in accelerated drug release . The main aim of the work was to study the effect of focused ultrasound and microbubbles on the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of the MMP sensitive liposome . The performance of the MMP sensitive liposome was compared to a non MMP sensitive version and Doxil like liposomes .,The observed penetration depth was independent of the acoustic pressure applied. FUS combined with MMP sensitive liposomes resulted in reduced tumour growth. The MMP sensitive liposome performed better than its non MMP sensitive version. The Doxil like and MMP sensitive liposome showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

We tested delivery of fluorescent indocarbocyanine lipids as a model lipophilic cargo via different carriers . Systemically injected T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat delivered ICLs to the BM more efficiently than erythrocytes and more selectively than PEGylated liposomes . Near infrared imaging showed that the delivery was restricted to the BM lungs liver and spleen with no accumulation in the kidneys brain heart intestines fat tissue and pancreas . Following systemic injection of ICL labeled cells in immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice few cells arrived in the BM intact . However between 5 and 10 of BM cells were ICL positive . Confocal microscopy of intact BM confirmed that ICLs are delivered independently of the injected cells .

Two types of IOLs were chosen hydrophobic and hydrophilic . Hydrophobic IOLs have shown better results in the prevention of PCO because they adhere better to the posterior capsular bag while hydrophilic IOLs are advised in the case of patients with uveitis glaucoma or diabetes .

Here model drug monomethyl auristatin E was conjugated ex vivo to Cys34 of albumin via a cathepsin B sensitive dipeptide linker to ensure that all drug would be bound specifically to albumin . The resulting albumin drug conjugate with a drug to albumin ratio of 1 retained the native secondary structure of albumin compared to conjugate with a higher DAR of 3 . ALDC1 exhibited improved drug release and cytotoxicity compared to ALDC3 in vitro . Slower plasma clearance and increased drug exposure over time of ALDC1 were observed compared to ALDC3 and MMAE prodrug . In single dose studies with MIA PaCa2 xenografts cohorts treated with ALDC1 had the highest amount of MMAE drug in tumor tissues compared to other treatment arms . After multiple dosing ALDC1 significantly delayed the tumor growth compared to control treatment arms MMAE MMAE linker conjugate and ALDC3 . When dosed with the maximum tolerated dose of ALDC1 there was complete eradication of 83.33 of the tumors in the treatment group . Ex vivo conjugated ALDC1 also significantly inhibited tumor growth in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model that better recapitulates the phenotype and clinical features of human pancreatic cancers . In summary site specific loading of drug to albumin at 1 1 ratio allowed the conjugate to better maintain the native structure of albumin and its intrinsic properties . By conjugating the drug to albumin prior to administration minimized premature cleavage and instability of the drug in plasma and enabled higher drug accumulation in tumors compared to in situ albumin binding prodrugs . This strategy to control drug loading ex vivo ensures complete drug binding to the albumin carrier and achieves excellent antitumor efficacy and it has the potential to greatly improve the outcomes of anticancer therapy .,Albumin drug conjugates with site specific conjugation at Cys34 ex vivo enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy. Controlled loading of drugs minimized the change in albumin structure and is crucial to higher drug accumulation in tumors.

105,Bacterial therapy which presents a smart platform for delivering and producing therapeutic agents as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modes has provided a breakthrough for the treatment of a range of diseases . The integration of synthetic biology technology with bacteria enables their characteristics like chemotaxis and biomolecule secretion to outperform conventional diagnostics and therapeutics thereby facilitating their clinical applications in a range of diseases . Compared to injection administered bacteria orally delivered bacteria improve patient compliance while avoiding the risk of systemic infections . However oral administration of microbes always leads to a substantial loss of viability due to the highly acidic environment in the stomach and bile salt in the intestine . Thus the formulation of these bacteria into microcapsules using appropriate biomaterials is a promising approach for reducing cell death during gastrointestinal passage and controlling the release of these therapeutic cells across the intestinal tract .

106,Infectious keratitis caused by bacterial biofilms is one of the main causes of corneal blindness presenting a serious threat to public health . In this study matrix metalloproteinase sensitive supramolecular nanoparticles were constructed for enhancing photodynamic antibacterial effect against biofilm associated bacterial keratitis . MMP S NPs were prepared by host guest self assembly of chlorin e6 conjugated cyclodextrin prodrug and MMP 9 sensitive peptides terminated with adamantane . MMP S NPs with EEEEEE peptide shell had a negatively charged surface preventing adhesion to the normal ocular surface or healthy corneal cells thus enhancing tear retention time . After arriving at the infected lesions the protective EEEEEE peptide shell of MMP S NPs was removed triggered by overexpressed MMP 9 in the keratitis microenvironment . The subsequently exposed cationic peptides helped the nanoparticles penetrate and accumulate in biofilms as well as bind to Gram negative bacteria,MMP 9 sensitive supramolecular nanoparticles were obtained by the host guest interaction.

The nanoparticles exhibited superior PDT of bacteria elimination and biofilm eradication in cornea.
107,The blood brain barrier is a dynamic diffusional barrier regulating the molecular and chemical flux between the blood and brain thereby preserving cerebral homeostasis . Endothelial cells form the core anatomical component of the BBB based on properties such as specialized junctional complexes between cells which restricts paracellular transport and extremely low levels of vesicular transport restricting transcytosis . In performing its protective function the BBB also constrains the entry of therapeutics into the brain hampering the treatment of various neurological disorders . Focused ultrasound is a novel therapeutic modality that has shown efficacy in transiently and non invasively opening the BBB for the targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain . Although the ability of ultrasound to disrupt the junctional assembly of endothelial cells has been partially investigated its effect on the transcellular mode of transport has been largely neglected . In this study we found that ultrasound induces a pronounced increase in the levels of the vesicle forming protein caveolin 1 . In order to investigate the role of vesicle mediated transcytoplasmic transport we compared the leakage of various cargo sizes between a mouse model that lacks caveolin 1 and wild type mice following sonication of the hippocampus . The absence of caveolin 1 did not lead to overt abnormalities in the cerebral vasculature in the mice . We found that caveolin 1 has a critical role specifically in the transport of large but not smaller cargoes . Our findings indicate differential effects of therapeutic ultrasound on cellular transport mechanisms with implications for therapeutic interventions .,Low intensity focused ultrasound FUS achieves safe and reproducible blood brain barrier BBB opening of the hippocampus. Levels of the vesicle forming protein caveolin 1 cav1 are significantly increased in the sonicated hippocampus. Similar leakage of small 3 kDa and medium 70 kDa dextran between cav1 knock out and wild type mice after sonication. Leakage of 500 kDa dextran was significantly reduced in the cav1 knock out mice. No influx observed for 2000 kDa dextran. The results suggest a critical role for transcytosis in the transport of larger cargoes following FUS mediated BBB opening.

112,Pharmaceutical drugs are an important part of the global healthcare system with some estimates suggesting over 50 of the world s population takes at least one medication per day . Most drugs are delivered as immediate release formulations that lead to a rapid increase in systemic drug concentration . Although these formulations have historically played an important role they can be limited by poor patient compliance adverse side effects low bioavailability or undesirable pharmacokinetics . Drug delivery systems featuring first order release kinetics have been able to improve pharmacokinetics but are not ideal for drugs with short biological half lives or small therapeutic windows .

120,For the past two decades biomimetic high density lipoproteins have been used for various drug delivery applications . The b HDL mimic the endogenous HDL and therefore possess many attractive features for drug delivery including high biocompatibility biodegradability and ability to transport and deliver their cargo to specific cells and tissues that are recognized by HDL . The b HDL designs reported in the literature often differ in size shape composition and type of incorporated cargo . However there exists only limited insight into how the b HDL design dictates their biodistribution . To fill this gap we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of biodistribution studies using various designs of apolipoprotein A I based b HDL . We carefully screened 679 papers for b HDL biodistribution studies in mice and ended up with 24 relevant biodistribution profiles that we compared according to b HDL design .

121,Nucleic acid based pattern recognition receptor agonists are effective adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents . Rather than single applications ligand combinations could synergistically potentiate immune responses by elevating cytokine and chemokine production via triggering multiple signaling pathways . However short half lives of such labile ligands due to nuclease attack and limited cellular uptake due to their structure significantly hamper their in vivo performances . More importantly simultaneous delivery and activity presentation of protein antigen and nucleic acid ligands critically limit the clinical development of these constructs . In this work we approached this problem by co encapsulating a model antigen ovalbumin along with TLR9 and STING ligands within liposomes a well established drug delivery system that enables payload stability and enhanced cellular activity upon internalization . Moreover by loading dual ligands we postulated to achieve heightened Th 1 immune response that would yield pronounced protective vaccine efficacy .

123,Multitemporal land cover classification over urban areas is challenging especially when using heterogeneous data sources with variable quality attributes . A prominent challenge is that classes with similar spectral signatures tend to be confused with one another . In this paper we evaluate the efficacy of image point cloud data combined with suitable Bayesian analysis based time series rectification techniques to improve the classification accuracy in a multitemporal context . The proposed method uses hidden Markov models to rectify land covers that are initially classified by a random forest algorithm . This land cover classification method is tested using time series of remote sensing data from a heterogeneous and rapidly changing urban landscape observed from 2006 to 2014 . The data consisted of aerial images Landsat data and airborne laser scanning data . The results of the study demonstrate that the addition of three dimensional image point cloud data derived from aerial stereo images as predictor variables improved overall classification accuracy around three percentage points . Additionally HMM based post processing reduces significantly the number of spurious year to year changes . Using a set of 240 validation points we estimated that this step improved overall classification accuracy by around 3.0 percentage points and up to 6 to 10 percentage points for some classes .

Our analysis shows that around 1.9 of the area around Kuopio city representing a total area of approximately 0.61km,Mulitemporal urban land cover classification is challenging but topical. Image point cloud IPC data helps better differentiate between land cover classes. IPC data can be used in conjunction with Bayesian techniques to yield consistent multitemporal land cover maps accuracy observed 92 kappa 0.89
124,Three dimensional surface deformation is resolved using deformations obtained from multiple line of sight differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar . However the random model is susceptible to both accidental errors and system errors .

125,Satellite remote sensing is an effective method for extracting water bodies on a large scale . Radar imagery such as synthetic aperture radar imagery can penetrate clouds and provide opportunities for water body identification when in situ observations are difficult to obtain because of severe weather conditions . However when using SAR images in urban areas to extract water bodies the radars double bounce effect results in complicated backscatter patterns of water near urban features such as buildings due to the side looking properties of SAR sensors and the vertical urban structures . Therefore the objective of this study is to propose a reliable urban water extraction framework for SAR images that integrates urban surface morphological features for controlling radars multiple bounces . Statistical and machine learning models were used to explore how radars double bounce effect influences the prediction performance of urban water extraction . Our findings indicate that when extracting urban water bodies urban waters backscatter values could be significantly interfered by the neighboring building density above a threshold height that contributes to radars multiple bounces . Without model calibration our framework incorporating urban surface morphology demonstrates high prediction ability with an Area Under the Curve of 0.914 and with 97.0 of urban water cells correctly identified by testing in another city sharing similar urban forms . In summary our study provides a better understanding of the role of the urban surface morphology in the double bounce effect in SAR images specifically for differentiating urban water and land thereby improving the accuracy of urban water extraction and enhancing the feasibility of further applications of SAR imagery under complex urban landscapes .,We clarified the urban morphological roles in water detection from SAR images. Our model captures the spatial heterogeneity of radars double bounce effect. Neighboring building density could contribute to radars multiple bounces. Our model can be applied to another city that shares similar urban forms.

127,Multi Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data offer a valuable support to landslide mapping and to landslide activity estimation in mountain environments where in situ measures are sometimes difficult to gather . Nowadays the interferometric approach is more and more used for wide areas analysis providing useful information for risk management actors but at the same time requiring a lot of efforts to correctly interpret what satellite data are telling us . In this context hot spot like analyses that select and highlight the fastest moving areas in a region of interest are a good operative solution for reducing the time needed to inspect a whole interferometric dataset composed by thousands or millions of points . In this work we go beyond the concept of MTInSAR data as simple mapping tools by proposing an approach whose final goal is the quantification of the potential loss experienced by an element at risk hit by a potential landslide . To do so it is mandatory to evaluate landslide intensity . Here we estimate intensity using Active Deformation Areas extracted from Sentinel 1 MTInSAR data . Depending on the localization of each ADA with respect to the urban areas intensity is derived in two different ways . Once exposure and vulnerability of the elements at risk are estimated the potential loss due to a landslide of a given intensity is calculated . We tested our methodology in the Eastern Valle dAosta along four lateral valleys of the Dora Baltea Valley . This territory is characterized by steep slopes and by numerous active and dormant landslides . The goal of this work is to develop a regional scale methodology based on satellite radar interferometry to assess the potential impact of landslides on the urban fabric .,Satellite interferometric data as tools for landslide intensity estimation.

128,Wetlands have been determined as one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth and are currently being lost at alarming rates . Large scale monitoring of wetlands is of high importance but also challenging . The Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite missions for the first time provide radar and optical data at high spatial and temporal detail and with this a unique opportunity for more accurate wetland mapping from space arises . Recent studies already used Sentinel 1 and 2 data to map specific wetland types or characteristics but for comprehensive wetland characterisations the potential of the data has not been researched yet . The aim of our research was to study the use of the high resolution and temporally dense Sentinel 1 and 2 data for wetland mapping in multiple levels of characterisation . The use of the data was assessed by applying Random Forests for multiple classification levels including general wetland delineation wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics . The results for the St. Lucia wetlands in South Africa showed that combining Sentinel 1 and 2 led to significantly higher classification accuracies than for using the systems separately . Accuracies were relatively poor for classifications in high vegetated wetlands as subcanopy flooding could not be detected with Sentinel 1s C band sensors operating in VV VH mode . When excluding high vegetated areas overall accuracies were reached of 88.5 for general wetland delineation 90.7 for mapping wetland vegetation types and 87.1 for mapping surface water dynamics . Sentinel 2 was particularly of value for general wetland delineation while Sentinel 1 showed more value for mapping wetland vegetation types . Overlaid maps of all classification levels obtained overall accuracies of 69.1 and 76.4 for classifying ten and seven wetland classes respectively .,Wetland complexities were mapped using a multi level classification scheme. Both wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics were classified. Combining Sentinel 1 and 2 provided the most accurate results. High vegetated wetlands could not be mapped accurately using Sentinel 1 and 2.
129,With the advent of social sensing in the Big Data era location based social media data are increasingly used to explore anthropogenic activities and their impacts on the environment . This study converts a typical kind of LBSM data geo tagged tweets into raster images at the 500m spatial resolution and compares them with the new generation nighttime lights image products the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day Night Band monthly image composites . The results show that the monthly tweet images are significantly correlated with the VIIRS DNB images at the pixel level . The tweet images have nearly the same ability on estimating electric power consumption and better performance on assessing personal incomes and population than the NTL images . Tweeted areas are closer to satellite derived built up urban areas than lit areas in NTL imagery making tweet images an alternative to delimit extents of human activities . Moreover the monthly tweet images do not show apparent seasonal changes and the values of tweet images are more stable across different months than VIIRS DNB monthly image composites . This study explores the potential of LBSM data at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolutions to estimate or map socioeconomic factors as an alternative to NTL images in the United States .,Geo tagged tweets were produced as tweet images at 500m resolution. Monthly tweet images are closely correlated with VIIRS DNB images at the pixel level. Tweet images can be used to assess or map human activities similarly to NTL images. Monthly tweet images are more stable free of seasonal effects than VIIRS DNB images.
130,The urban heat island is increasingly recognized as a serious worldwide problem because of urbanization and climate change . Urban vegetation is capable of alleviating UHI and improving urban environment by shading together with evapotranspiration . While the impacts of abundance and spatial configuration of vegetation on land surface temperature have been widely examined very little attention has been paid to the role of vertical structure of vegetation in regulating LST . In this study we investigated the relationships between horizontal vertical structure characteristics of urban tree canopy and LST as well as diurnal divergence in Nanjing City China with the help of high resolution vegetation map Light Detection and Ranging data and various statistical analysis methods . The results indicated that composition configuration and vertical structure of tree canopy were all significantly related to both daytime LST and nighttime LST . Tree canopy showed stronger influence on LST during the day than at night . Note that the contribution of composition of tree canopy to explaining spatial heterogeneity of LST regardless of day and night was the highest followed by vertical structure and configuration . Combining composition configuration and vertical structure of tree canopy can take advantage of their respective advantages and best explain variation in both daytime LST and nighttime LST . As for the independent importance of factors affecting spatial variation of LST percent cover of tree canopy mean tree canopy height amplitude of tree canopy height and patch cohesion index were the most influential during the day while the most important variables were PLAND maximum height of tree canopy variance of tree canopy height and COHESION at night . This research extends our understanding of the impacts of urban trees on the UHI effect from the horizontal to three dimensional space . In addition it may offer sustainable and effective strategies for urban designers and planners to cope with increasing temperature .,Tree canopy showed stronger influence on UHI during the day than the night. Composition of tree canopy was the most influential in ameliorating diurnal UHI. UHI can be mitigated by regulating horizontal and vertical structure of tree canopy.
131,Wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species and contribute significantly to overall biodiversity in Ireland . Despite these known ecosystem services the total wetland area in Ireland has reduced significantly over the past few decades leading to an ongoing need to protect such environments . The EU Habitats Directive has recognised several wetlands types as priority habitats . This study concentrates on a subset of the priority habitats focussing on some groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems as well as raised bogs . Monitoring these sites across the country by field visits is resource intensive . Therefore this study has evaluated remote sensing as a potentially cost effective tool for monitoring the ecological health of the wetlands . Identification and presence of certain vegetation communities can indicate the condition of the wetland which can be used for monitoring for example activities causing degradation or the progress of restoration attempts . The ecological composition of the wetlands has been analysed using open source Sentinel 2 data . 10 bands of Sentinel 2 Level 2 data and 3 indices Normalised Difference Vegetation Index Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalised Difference Water Index were used to create vegetation maps of each wetland using Bagged Tree ensemble classifier and graph cut segmentation also known as MAP maximum a,Remote monitoring the ecological condition of the wetlands.

PROSAIL LUT inversion MLR GPR models performed better than VIs models. NDVI generated with combination of Sentinel 2 740nm 783nm and 2190nm bands exhibited the maximum sensitivity to LAI. PROSAIL LUT and MLR GPR offered higher accuracy than global LAI products.
133,Accurate spatio temporal classification of crops is of prime importance for in season crop monitoring . Synthetic Aperture Radar data provides diverse physical information about crop morphology .

In this context the 44 real Kennaugh matrix representation of a full polarimetric SAR data is utilized which can provide valuable information about various morphological and dielectric attributes of a scatterer . The elements of the Kennaugh matrix are used as the parameters for the classification of crop types using the random forest and the extreme gradient boosting classifiers .,Use of Kennaugh matrix representation for agricultural crop classification. Implemented a new day wise and time series approach for classification. Comparison of day wise and time series approaches using RF and XGB classifiers.
134,Algal blooms and the resulting deterioration of water quality have threatened the environmental health of inland lakes . This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea the largest inland water body in California . An innovative gypsum bloom index was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra data for three bands during 20002018 . Discoloration was observed in the gypsum bloom infested waters mapped using the hue saturation and value color model . We found that the GI is able to effectively map gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea with a relatively high accuracy the largest gypsum bloom area was observed in summer with notable gypsum blooms lasting more than 40 days in 2003 2005 2006 2016 and 2018 the gypsum bloom infested waters shifted from the center to the southeastern shore of the lake during 20032018 and the frequency of gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008 . Meanwhile the temporal and spatial differences between the northwestern and southeastern lake increased over the observation period and discoloration occurred in the gypsum bloom infested waters and lasted for 14 days on average longer periods of discoloration occurred d in 2002 2016 and 2018 . The reconstruction of gypsum bloom dynamics in the Salton Sea provides valuable information for the practical management and restoration of the Salton Sea .,An innovative gypsum bloom index GI was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on MODIS data. The GI index was applied to Salton Sea to extract gypsum blooms during 20002018. The gypsum bloom infested waters have shifted and the frequency of the gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008.
135,The majority of the boreal forests in Finland are regularly thinned or clear cut and these actions are regulated by the Forest Act . To generate a near real time tool for monitoring management actions an automatic change detection modelling chain was developed using Sentinel 2 satellite images . In this paper we focus mainly on the error evaluation of this automatized workflow to understand and mitigate incorrect change detections . Validation material related to clear cut thinned and unchanged areas was collected by visual evaluation of VHR images which provided a feasible and relatively accurate way of evaluating forest characteristics without a need for prohibitively expensive fieldwork . This validation data was then compared to model predictions classified in similar change categories . The results indicate that clear cuts can be distinguished very reliably but thinned stands exhibit more variation . For thinned stands coverage of broadleaved trees and detections from certain single dates were found to correlate with the success of the modelling results . In our understanding this relates mainly to image quality regarding haziness and translucent clouds . However if the growing season is short and cloudiness frequent there is a clear trade off between the availability of good quality images and their preferred annual span . Gaining optimal results therefore depends both on the targeted change types and the requirements of the mapping frequency .,Forest changes were automatically modelled from multitemporal Sentinel 2 images. Errors were evaluated based on visually interpreted VHR images. Extraction of clear cuts was accurate whereas thinnings had more variation. Image quality and translucent clouds had most significant effect on errors. Results were regarded applicable for operational change monitoring.
136,Monitoring agricultural land cover is highly relevant for global early warning systems such as ASAP because it represents the basis for detecting production deficits in food security assessment . Given the significant inconsistencies among existing land cover datasets there is a need to obtain a more accurate representation of the spatial distribution and extent of agricultural area in Africa . In this research we explore a fusion approach that combines the strength of individual datasets and minimises their limitations . Specifically a semi automatic method is developed relying on multi criteria analysis complemented with manual fine tuning using the best rated datasets to generate two hybrid and static agricultural masks one for cropland and another for grassland . Following a comprehensive selection of land cover maps each dataset is evaluated at country level according to five criteria timeliness spatial resolution comparison with FAO statistics accuracy assessment and expert evaluation . A sensitivity analysis is performed based on an evaluation of the impact of weight settings on the resulting land cover . The proposed methodology is capable of improving agricultural characterisation in Africa . As a result two static masks at 250m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2016 are provided .,A multi criteria analysis MCA is developed to generate a cropland and grassland hybrid mask. Each land cover dataset is evaluated at country level by five different criteria. The MCA approach offers a flexible and transparent methodology to combine different data. The hybrid masks are used in the JRC ASAP early warning system and are freely accessible.
137,Many real world applications require remotely sensed images at both high spatial and temporal resolutions . This requirement however is generally not met by single satellite system . A number of spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to overcome this constraint . Landsat and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data have been extensively used for detection and monitoring of active fires at different scales . Fusing the data obtained from these sensors will therefore significantly contribute to the satellite based monitoring of fires . Among the available spatiotemporal fusion methods the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model and enhanced STARFM algorithms have been widely used for studying the land surface dynamics in the homogeneous and heterogeneous regions . The present study explores the applicability of STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms for fusing the high spatial resolution Landsat 8 OLI data with high temporal resolution VIIRS data in the context of active surface coal fire monitoring . Further a modified version of ESTARFM algorithm referred as modified ESTARFM is developed to improve the performance of the fusion model . Jharia coalfield known for widespread occurrences of coal fires is taken as the study area . The qualitative and quantitative assessments of the predicted Landsat like images from different algorithms indicate that the modified ESTARFM outperforms the other fusion approaches used in this study . Considering the advantages limitations and performance of the algorithms used modified ESTARFM along with STARFM can be used for surface coal fire monitoring . The study will not only contribute to remote sensing based coal fire studies but also to other applications such as forest fires crop residue burning land cover and land use change vegetation phenology etc .,Spatiotemporal fusion framework is constructed for coal fire monitoring application. The fusion of VIIRS with Landsat 8 OLI is achieved by weight function based method. The channel specific retrieval of similar pixels is used in modified ESTARFM method. The prediction error is reduced in modified ESTARFM method.
138,Large scale land change maps are essential to support policies addressing land transformations . Calibration and validation of large scale land change maps require reference data that are commonly acquired by visual interpretation of remotely sensed images . However visual interpretation itself is prone to error . Little is known about factors influencing the quality and consistency of changes detected by visual interpretation . This paper reports on an experiment assessing the effect of the number of very high resolution images and land change process types on the consistency of visual interpretations . The experiment involved 48 sites scattered over Europe for which 18 individuals interpreted very high resolution images which were provided via Google Earth . Land change process type was found to have a significant impact on the consistency of visual interpretations while the marginal effect of the number of images was not significant . Absence of change on non agricultural land was interpreted with high consistency . On the contrary agricultural land abandonment and reforestation were the least consistent in their interpretation . We conclude that for increased efficiency resources allocated to acquire reference data by visual interpretation should be adjusted based on the expected type of land change . Interpretation of agricultural land abandonment reforestation and agricultural land expansion require most efforts .,Land change process type had a significant impact on interpretation consistency. The number of available images had no significant effect. Absence of change of non agricultural land was most consistently interpreted. Land abandonment reforestation and agricultural expansion were least consistent.
139,Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield . In this study we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil . The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and or vegetation indices . Therefore we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops in the season prior to cash crop planting . Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models . They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope constellation of satellites . From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017 we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models . The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones . The cover crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination R,We delineated management zones using cover crop AGB estimates from PlanetScope data. Cover crop AGB forage turnip white oats rye was correlated with cash crop yield. Four of seven regression models SVM SGB CUB and RF had similar AGB performance. Management zones from cover crop AGB agreed with those from cash crop yields. Cover crop AGB estimates at the date of maximum VI were a proxy of management zones.
140,Mapping heathland habitats is generally challenging due to fine scale habitats as well as spectral ambiguities between different classes . A multi seasonal time series of multispectral RapidEye data from several phenological stages was analysed towards the classification of different vegetation communities .,We propose a multi level hierarchical classification approach. The approach is tested by mapping a heathland area. We compare two aggregation methods for the multi level maps. We discuss trade offs between the level classes and the classification accuracy.
141,The 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake triggered plenty of coseismic giant landslides which resulted in almost one third of total fatalities and economic losses during the event . Previous studies investigated the spatial relations between landslide distribution and topographic and seismic factors such as elevation slope aspect distance from rupture trace and seismic intensity . However few studies are performed exploring the effects of coseismic surface deformation and Coulomb stress change on triggering landslides due to lack of adequate deformation observation data and stress calculation model for slope failure . In this study we develop an envelope method to map an entire coseismic deformation field in both near and far field areas of seismic faults through the data fusion from InSAR and pixel offset tracking techniques . The change in static Coulomb stress acting on coseismic landsliding surface caused by the event is determined using the faulting model derived from the joint inversion of InSAR and GPS data and also with the use of the elastic half space dislocation theory and the generalized Hooks law . The analysis suggests the spatial response pattern of seismic landslides to the coseismic ground motion and stress change especially in the vicinity of fault rupture trace . The landslide density dramatically rises with the stress increase within the range from Yingxiu to Beichuan areas along the major surface rupture . Moving further and eastward along the fault strike most of large landslides are triggered as the zone of positive SCS change narrows . Moreover the high magnitude surface displacements are possibly responsible for the giant landsliding events in the easternmost section . From the analysis of the stress transfer the occurrence of landslides in the study area is largely controlled by the Yingxiu Beichuan fault with overwhelming rupture length and fault slip yet the Pengguan fault indeed shows dominance in the area between the two faults . The results show that coseismic surface deformation and static Coulomb stress change can serve as two significant controlling factors on seismic landslide distribution and that the stress factor seems more significant in the vicinity of surface rupture .,An envelope method is developed to map entire coseismic deformation through data fusion from InSAR and POT techniques. The change in static Coulomb stress acting on coseismic landsling surface is determined using the faulting model. The spatial response pattern of seismic landslides to the coseismic motion and stress change is quantitatively revealed.
142,Accurate and current road network data is fundamental to land management and emergency response yet challenging to produce for unpaved roads in rural and forested regions using traditional cartographic approaches . Automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery using deep learning is a promising alternative gaining increasing attention however most efforts have focused on urban paved roads and used very high spatial resolution imagery which is less frequently available for rural regions . Additionally road extraction routines still struggle to produce a fully connected vectorized road network . In this study covering a large forested area in Western Canada we developed and evaluated a routine to automatically extract unpaved road pixels using a convolutional neural network and then used the CNN outputs to update a pre existing government road network and evaluate if and how it would change . To cover the large spatial extent mapped in this study we trained the routine using moderately high resolution satellite imagery from the RapidEye constellation and a ground truth dataset collected with smartphones by organizations already operating and driving in the region . Performance of the road extraction was comparable to results achieved by others using very high resolution imagery,We extracted unpaved roads from RapidEye imagery with 87 precision and 89 recall. Post processing improved initial predictions produced by the neural network. Results changed the public road database by 20 through additions and removals.
143,The fractional vegetation cover crop residue cover and bare soil are three important parameters in vegetationsoil ecosystems and their correct and timely estimation can improve crop monitoring and environmental monitoring . The triangular space method uses one CRC index and one vegetation index to create a triangular space in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation crop residue and bare soil . Subsequently the CRC FVC and BS of mixed remote sensing pixels can be distinguished by their spatial locations in the triangular space . However soil moisture and crop residue moisture significantly reduce the performance of broadband remote sensing CRC indices and can thus decrease the accuracy of the remote estimation and mapping of CRC FVC and BS . This study evaluated the use of broadband remote sensing the triangular space method and the random forest technique to estimate and map the FVC CRC and BS of cropland in which SM CRM changes dramatically . A spectral dataset was obtained using from a field based experiment with a field spectrometer and from a laboratory based simulation that included four distinct soil types three types of crop residue one crop and varying SM CRM . We trained an RF model that can magnify spectral features of crop residue and soil by using the broadband remote sensing angle indices as input and uses a moisture resistant hyperspectral index as the target . The effects of moisture on crop residue and soil were minimized by using the broadband CRRF . Then the CRRF NDVI triangular space method was used to estimate and map CRC FVC and BS . Our method was validated by using both laboratory and field based experiments and Sentinel 2 broadband remote sensing images . Our results indicate that the CRRF NDVI triangular space method can reduce the effect of moisture on the broadband remote sensing of CRC and may also help to obtain laboratory and field CRC FVC and BS . Thus the proposed method has great potential for application to croplands in which the SM CRM content changes dramatically .,Soil and crop residue moisture effects were minimized by broadband crop residue index from the random forest CRRF . Broadband CRRF for dry and saturated soil and crop residue samples are very similar. Broadband CRRF shows significant promise in areas in which the soil and crop residue moisture content changes dramatically.
144,Hyperspectral remote sensing imaging spectroscopy has enabled precise identification and mapping of hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages based on diagnostic absorption features of minerals . In the present study we use Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation datasets acquired over Rishabdev ultramafic suite to derive surficial mineral map using least square based spectral shape matching in wavelength range of diagnostic absorption features of minerals . Resulting mineral map revealed presence of hydrothermally altered serpentine group of minerals and associated alteration products along with clays and phyllosilicates . Mineral maps are validated using field spectral measurements and published geological map . Involvement of low temperature hydrothermal fluid in serpentinization of ultramafic rocks in the region is inferred from analysis of deepest absorption features of muscovites at 2.20 m spectral abundance of lizardite and absence of prenhite pumpyllite facies mineral assemblages . Talc was found to be the most common alteration product of serpentines followed by dolomites . Intense alteration of serpentines to talc along the fracture zone is attributed to the circulation of carbon dioxide rich hydrothermal fluids along these conduits . Kaolinite and halloysite are primarily associated with granites and are the result of hydrothermal alteration of plagioclase feldspar in granites while muscovite and illites are generally associated with phyllites and quartzites . The study demonstrates the potential of imaging spectroscopy for mapping hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages in ultramafic complex .,AVIRIS NG datasets are used to map spectrally similar minerals over Rishabdev ultramafic suite. Serpentines its alteration products clays and phyllosilicates are mapped. Results are validated using field spectral measurements and geological map. Shift in wavelength position of muscovites near 2.20 m is observed. Two episodes of low temperature hydrothermal fluid circulation is inferred.
145,To tackle Big Data challenges such as Volume Variety and Velocity the Earth Observations Data Cube concept has emerged as a solution for lowering barriers and offering new possibilities to harness the information power of satellite EO data . However installing configuring and managing an EODC instance is still difficult requiring specific knowledge and capabilities . Consequently facilitating and automating the generation and provision of EODC given specific users requirements can be beneficial .,Facilitate the generation and provision of a Data Cube instance based on simple user requirements. Users have to specify an area of interest sensors temporal frame and provide an email address. DCoD approach can reduce the burden of software installation configuration and data ingestion. Provides more flexibility and scalability as well as a strengthened sense of ownership.
146,The fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation is a crucial variable for assessing global carbon balances and currently there is an urgent need for reference data to validate satellite derived fAPAR products . However it is well known that fAPAR ground measurements are associated with considerable uncertainties . Generally fAPAR measurements can be carried out with two three and four flux approaches depending on the number of flux terms measured . Currently not much is known about the number of flux terms needed to satisfactorily reduce systematic errors . This study investigates the accuracy of different fAPAR estimates based on permanent 10 min PAR measurements using Wireless Sensor Networks at three forest sites located in Central Europe North America and Central America . All fAPAR estimates reflect the seasonal course of fAPAR . The highest average biases of different fAPAR estimates account to 0.02 at the temperate 0.08 at the boreal and 0.05 at the tropical site respectively thereby generally fulfilling the uncertainty threshold of a maximum of 10 or 0.05 fAPAR units set by the Global Climate Observing System . During high wind speed conditions at the boreal site the bias of the two flux fAPAR estimate exceeded the 0.05 uncertainty threshold . Three flux fAPAR estimates were not found to be advantageous especially at the tropical site . Our findings are beneficial for the development of sampling protocols that are needed to validate global satellite derived fAPAR products .,fAPAR ground estimates assessed against GCOS requirements in 3 forest ecosystems. Uncertainties of two flux fAPAR estimates found acceptable under summer conditions. Significant influences on bias of fAPAR by colored leaves and higher wind speed. Bias of two flux fAPAR 0.08 at boreal site exceeded 0.05 uncertainty threshold. Three flux fAPAR estimates not found advantageous at tropical and temperate site
147,The Sentinel 2 Multi Spectral Imager has three spectral bands centered at 705 740 and 783nm wavelengths that exploit the red edge information useful for quantifying plant biochemical traits . This sensor configuration is expected to improve the prediction accuracy of vegetation chlorophyll content . In this work we assessed the performance of several statistical and physical based methods in retrieving canopy chlorophyll content from Sentinel 2 in a heterogeneous mixed mountain forest . Amongst the algorithms presented in the literature 13 different vegetation indices a non parametric statistical approach and two radiative transfer models were used to assess the CCC prediction accuracy . A eld campaign was conducted in July 2017 to collect,The study provides a comprehensive comparison of methods for CCC retrieval from Sentinel 2 imagery. The results of the study demonstrate that both the physical based and statistical approaches results are comparable. INFORM inversion using LUT is the unbiased predictor of CCC from remote sensing data. The hybrid approach yielded accuracies similar to the LUT inversion and may be the preferred method for large scale mapping.
148,Climate oscillation modes can shape weather across the globe due to atmospheric teleconnections . We built on the findings of a recent study to assess whether the impacts of teleconnections are detectable and significant in the early season dynamics of highland pastures across five rayons in Kyrgyzstan . Specifically since land surface phenology has already shown to be influenced by snow cover seasonality and terrain we investigated here how much more explanatory and predictive power information about climatic oscillation modes might add to explain variation in LSP . We focused on seasonal values of five climate oscillation indices that influence vegetation dynamics in Central Asia . We characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from LSP modeling using Landsat NDVI time series together with MODIS land surface temperature data Peak Height the maximum modeled NDVI and Thermal Time to Peak the quantity of accumulated growing degree days based on LST required to reach PH . Next we calculated two metrics of snow cover seasonality from MODIS snow cover composites last date of snow and the number of snow covered dates . For terrain features we derived elevation slope and TRASP index as linearization of aspect . First we used Spearmans rank correlation to assess the geographical differentiation of land surface phenology metrics responses to environmental variables . PH showed weak correlations with TTP and moderate relationships with LDoS and SCD only in one northeastern rayon . Slope was weakly related to PH while TRASP showed a consistent moderate negative correlation with PH . A significant but weak negative correlation was found between PH and SCAND JJA and a significant weak positive correlation with MEI MAM . TTP showed consistently strong negative relationships with LDoS SCD and elevation . Very weak positive correlations with TTP were found for EAWR DJF AMO DJF and MEI DJF in western rayons only . Second we used Partial Least Squares regression to investigate the role of oscillation modes altogether . PLS modelling of TTP showed that thermal time accumulation could be explained mostly by elevation and snow cover metrics leading to reduced models explaining 55 to 70 of observed variation in TTP . Variable selection indicated that NAO JJA AMO JJA and SCAND MAM had significant relationships with TTP but their input of predictive power was neglible . PLS models were able to explain up to 29 of variability in PH . SCAND JJA and MEI MAM were shown to be significant predictors but adding them into models did not influence modeling performance . We concluded the impacts of climate oscillation anomalies were not detectable or significant in mountain pastures using LSP metrics at fine spatial resolution . Rather at a 30m resolution the indirect effects of seasonal climatic oscillations are overridden by terrain influences and snow cover timing . Whether climate oscillation mode indices can provide some new and useful information about growing season conditions remains a provocative question particularly in light of the multiple environmental challenges facing the agropastoralism livelihood in montane Central Asia .,Explored the influence of five climate oscillation modes on land surface phenology LSP . Previous studies found influence of modes on precipitation and temperature in Central Asia. At 30m resolution we found generally negligible influence of modes in highland pastures. Snow cover seasonality and terrain factors more tightly linked to LSP. Study demonstrates how local factors can override influence of teleconnections.
149,Classification of very high resolution imagery is challenging due to the difficulty in mining complex spatial and spectral patterns from rich image details . Various object based Convolutional Neural Networks for VHRI classification have been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the redundant pixel wise CNNs owing to their low computational cost and fine contour preserving . However classification performance of OCNN is still limited by geometric distortions insufficient feature representation and lack of contextual guidance . In this paper an innovative multi level context guided classification method with the OCNN is proposed . A feature fusing OCNN including the object contour preserving mask strategy with the supplement of object deformation coefficient is developed for accurate object discrimination by learning simultaneously high level features from independent spectral patterns geometric characteristics and object level contextual information . Then pixel level contextual guidance is used to further improve the per object classification results . The MLCG OCNN method is intentionally tested on two validated small image datasets with limited training samples to assess the performance in applications of land cover classification where a trade off between time consumption of sample training and overall accuracy needs to be found as it is very common in the practice . Compared with traditional benchmark methods including the patch based per pixel CNN the patch based per object CNN the pixel wise CNN with object segmentation refinement semantic segmentation U Net and DeepLabV3 MLCG OCNN method achieves remarkable classification performance . Compared with the state of the art architecture DeepLabV3 the MLCG OCNN method demonstrates high computational efficiency for VHRI classification .,A multi level context guided object based classification method is proposed. Combination of contour preserving mask strategy with object deformation coefficient for high level feature extraction. The proposed object based method achieves high computational efficiency with competitive classification performance.
150,Remote sensing technology is important for soil organic matter estimation but existing studies have mainly relied on a single data source . This limitation makes it difficult to simultaneously ensure high spatial resolution high spectral accuracy and refined temporal granularity simultaneously which can not meet the requirements of the spatiotemporal dynamics representation . This study aimed to introduce a new remote sensing image source into SOM modeling and spatiotemporal estimation generated by fusing together Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 remote sensing images that have a 5 day revisit cycle 10m spatial resolution and 21 different bands in blue green red and NIR spectral ranges . According to the image fusion process a total of 52 available images were acquired between November 2016 and December 2018 in Donghai County China . The fused images were used for SOM estimation model associated with 107 field samples . The results indicated that first the optimal model consisted of the band reflectivity and RVI which were derived from the fused images and the R,The refined spatiotemporal features of SOM were estimated according to remote sensing fusion. The estimation accuracies of SOM are influenced by actual SOM contents. The SOM content demonstrated similar spatial features in different temporal scales.
151,Surface soil water content plays an important role in driving the exchange of latent and sensible heat between the atmosphere and land surface through transpiration and evaporation processes regulating key physiological processes affecting plants growth . Given the high impact of water scarcity on yields and of irrigated agriculture on the overall withdrawal rate of freshwater it is important to define models that help to improve water resources management for agricultural purposes and to optimize rainfed crop yield . Recent advances in satellite based remote sensing have led to valuable solutions to estimate soil water content based on microwave or optical thermal infrared data . This study aims at improving soil water content estimation at high spatial and temporal resolution by means of the Optical Trapezoid Model driven by Copernicus Sentinel 2 data . Two different model variations were considered based on linear and nonlinear parameters constraints and validated against,SM at high spatial and temporal resolution in rainfed and irrigated conditions. OPTRAM based on linear and nonlinear parameters constraints for SM estimations. Universal parameterization for crop VS single parameterization for a given location. SM from Sentinel2 Observations and SM from Metop ASCAT and Sentinel 1 CGLS .
152,The timing of spring initiates an important period for resource availability for large trophic webs within ecosystems including forage for grazing animals flowers for pollinators and the higher trophic levels that depend on these resources . Spring timing is highly variable across space being influenced strongly by the departure of snow cover climate weather elevation and latitude . When spring timing occurs along a gradient the organisms that rely on spring resources often migrate to maintain an optimal position for spring resources a phenomenon known as surfing the green wave . While this behavior has been observed by tracking animals there have been no studies to quantify the green wave as a movement across space and time . Furthermore considering that snowmelt timing has moderate power to explain green up timing for a given location we ask the question does snowmelt velocity predict green wave velocity Here we introduce the first continental maps of snowmelt and green wave velocity for North America from 2001 to 2016as derived from the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology dataset . We show that both snowmelt and green wave velocities are influenced strongly by topography including slope and aspect . Furthermore we quantify the relationships between snowmelt and green wave velocities according to three variables direction speed and distance traveled . We conclude that mountainous ecoregions such as the western North American cordillera have the highest correspondence between snowmelt and green wave velocities compared to flatter regions such as the Great Plains and tundra . This work will be of interest to wildlife ecologists biologists and land managers who seek to conserve migratory animals and the ecosystems that support them .,A novel method to calculate green wave velocity from remotely sensed imagery. Continental analysis of North America finds regional patterns in resource waves. Green wave velocity is preceded by and correlated with snowmelt velocity. Mountains have the strongest relationships between snowmelt and green wave velocity.
153,Most studies have the achieved rapid and accurate determination of soil organic carbon using laboratory spectroscopy however it remains difficult to map the spatial distribution of SOC . To predict and map SOC at a regional scale we obtained fourteen hyperspectral images from the Gaofen 5 satellite and decomposed and reconstructed the original reflectance and the first derivative reflectance using discrete wavelet transform at different scales . At these different scales as inputs we selected the 3 optimal bands with the highest weight coefficient using principal component analysis and chose the normalized difference index ratio index and difference index with the strongest correlation with the SOC content using a contour map method . These inputs were then used to build regional scale SOC prediction models using random forest support vector machine and back propagation neural network algorithms . The results indicated that 1 at a low decomposition scale DWT can effectively eliminate the noise in satellite hyperspectral data and the FDR combined with DWT can improve the SOC prediction accuracy significantly 2 the method of selecting inputs using principal component analysis and a contour map can eliminate the redundancy of hyperspectral data while retaining the physical meaning of the inputs . For the model with the highest prediction accuracy the inputs were all derived from the wavelength range of SOC variations 3 the differences in prediction accuracy among the different prediction models are small and 4 the SOC prediction accuracy using hyperspectral satellite data is greatly improved compared with that of previous SOC prediction studies using multispectral satellite data . This study provides a highly robust and accurate method for predicting and mapping regional SOC contents .,Regional scale soil organic carbon SOC prediction and mapping using hyperspectral satellite data. Using hyperspectral satellite data greatly improved the SOC prediction accuracy. Discrete wavelet transform can effectively eliminate the noise in hyperspectral satellite data. The sensitive bands selected in hyperspectral data for SOC prediction is not in the range of multispectral data. Obtained the highest SOC prediction accuracy by using BP neural network prediction model.
154,Satellite derived vegetation indices are widely utilized in yield forecasting models however they can be heavily impacted by atmospheric conditions due to their reliance on visible and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Given the importance of soil moisture for crop development the objective of this study was to investigate the use of passive microwave derived estimates of surface SM obtained by the SM Ocean Salinity Mission satellite for forecasting canola yields across the Canadian Prairies within Agriculture and Agri Food Canadas Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster model . Weekly SMOS SM observations were combined with climate variables and normalized difference vegetation index data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer platform and used as an input for forecasting canola yields at the township scale across the Canadian Prairies from 2010 to 2016 . Top predictors were identified and regression models were built using a robust least angle regression and leave one out cross validation scheme . SM was found to provide a better descriptor of canola stress than the more widely utilized NDVI being selected as a predictor in 74.2 of developed ecodistrict models over the 7 year period compared to just 41.2 for NDVI . The difference between model R,Potential of passive microwave soil moisture in yield forecasting was evaluated. Agroclimatic NDVI and SMOS soil moisture indices were included in crop forecast system. Passive microwave soil moisture in Week 24 was the top predictor of canola yield. SMOS soil moisture provided a better indicator of yield than NDVI. Greater model improvements observed in regions with poor climate station coverage.
155,Coffee is a global commodity that supports the livelihoods of 100 million people worldwide many of whom are smallholder farmers . While smallholder farmers are known to be vulnerable to social and environmental changes the complex interactions that shape their vulnerability have not been adequately explored . This analysis identifies the determinants of that vulnerability in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica and discusses how these determinants interact and have evolved . We use mixed methods consisting of household surveys of 434 farmers focus group discussions key informant interviews and archival research of coffee industry reports . We show that vulnerability is manifest in low coffee harvests that result from the interacting stressors of climate variability plant diseases and market conditions . The impacts of shocks and stressors are further aggravated by low resource endowments that influence the capacity to manage these persistent challenges as well as a political economy characterized by unequal market relations national policies that promote a vulnerable coffee variety and a retraction of public investments in smallholders . Using regression methods we show that among the farmer resources the ability to invest in agricultural inputs and tools as well as the elevation of the farm are importantly associated with production outcomes . We argue that the context of these smallholder farmers produces a Gordian Vulnerability whereby the determinants interact are changing in form and appear intractable . Consequently strategies to reduce vulnerability need to be complex and multifaceted which make them difficult to implement . We argue that reductions in vulnerability will only come about by investments in multiple strategies .,Small scale coffee farmers in Jamaicas Blue Mountains BM experience low production from multiple stresses. BM coffee farmer vulnerability is produced by a dynamic hazard context low farmer capacities and a political economy that acts as an amplifier. The ability to invest in agricultural inputs and tools and altitude are importantly associated with production outcomes. We argue that smallholder farmers in the BM face an intractable situation that requires renewed external support. This analysis is the first detailed study of vulnerability in Jamaicas BM region the BM context is similar to many coffee producing regions.
156,Land requisition has been an important way for local Chinese governments to generate revenue and promote urbanization but little is known how the land losing farmers cope . This study investigates the impact of land requisition on farmers off farm labor participation . We provide evidence that rural urban migration is one way that land losing farmers now adapt to land requisition . Using data from the China Household Finance Survey we first show that village characteristics not household characteristics are the key determining factors for how likely a household is to lose land . With a traditional difference in differences model and a DD model with individual fixed effects we show that land loss due to government requisition has a significant migration effect in the total sample it increases individual migration rates by 4.56.8 percentage points . Land requisition has no impact on local off farm engagement . These findings are robust to using different samples to correction for sample attrition and to a falsification test . We also find that the migration effect is experienced in particular by younger and older farmers by women and by the better educated . From a policy perspective the labor allocation response to land requisition identified in this paper suggests that providing job training and social protection to land losing farmers and facilitating their migration to cities could help them to cope with the experience of land loss .,Land requisition decisions made by administrative bureaucracies are independent of the observed household and individual characteristics. Land loss due to government requisition increases individual migration propensity by 4.5 to 6.8 percentage points. Land requisition has no impact on local off farm engagement.
157,This article considers the concept of the rebel social contract by examining the case of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . The concept of the social contract is a cornerstone of political theory and is increasingly invoked in discussions of civil war and authoritarian regimes when prospective rulers offer political protections and social benefits in return for the allegiance of citizens . The social contract is often assumed to exist but is rarely evaluated empirically . It remains difficult to distinguish between political stability derived from consent and stability derived from coercion and domination given their observational equivalence . Civil wars in which rebel groups seek to supplant the state provide opportunities to observe the construction and negotiation of new social contracts . The article uses Hirschmans exit voice loyalty typology to develop a qualitative empirical method for evaluating evidence of the rebels offer of a social contract to civilians and their acceptance or rejection of that offer . We demonstrate this method by applying it to the case of IS using evidence including official IS documents social media posts from within IS controlled territory and interviews with individuals who have personally experienced IS governance . We conclude that while IS leadership wanted to gain voluntary assent most of the civilian response to IS rule suggested domination and authoritarian forms of social contract building . This finding is illustrative of the analytical and methodological challenges involved in studying the social contract in rebel governance and the importance of considering domination not just reciprocity as the foundation for political order .,This article considers the concept of the rebel social contract by examining the case of the Islamic State. The rebel social contract is often assumed to exist but is rarely evaluated empirically. Civil wars provide opportunities to observe the construction and negotiation of new social contracts. This article adopts Hirschmans exit voice loyalty typology to develop an empirical method for evaluating the rebel social contracts. Applying this method to the case of IS we conclude that while IS wanted to gain voluntary assent its social contract was highly authoritarian.
158,During the last decades several regions of the world have experienced an increasingly forceful penetration by commercial service companies into irrigation water management altering the institutional structures and procedures of common pool resources management . In many cases private sector penetration takes place when water user organizations require a company to implement high tech water control such as pressurized irrigation systems as part of modernization policies . This study focuses on four representative cases of these processes with differing degrees of private enterprise penetration in the Valencia Region . The research analyzes the strategies of collective private confrontation and collaboration that are emerging in irrigator communities and characterize how they affect the management of these irrigation systems . Results show how private enterprise intrusion has unequally affected the interactions between the different components of these irrigation systems . This has created different hybrids between private and common pool resources management institutions as well as different autonomies dependencies and socio political subjects . Users capacity to guide this coproduction process and maintain local control over their irrigation systems is essential to ensure the stability and preserve the robustness of each irrigation system . The quality of human capital and the recognition of collective water management values makes irrigation entities more robust vis vis external pressures and disturbances which in some of the cases analyzed have generated major social conflicts .,Technological change facilitates private company penetration into irrigation commons. Users control draws the conceptual borderline between outsourcing and privatization. Users capacity to guide the collective private coproduction is crucial. Human capital and awareness of collective values are decisive to preserve robustness. Collective and private action can hybridize without undermining systems robustness.
159,Why does a slum community mobilize differently around different public services I use qualitative data derived from ethnographic fieldwork in four urban slum communities in Delhi India to examine the strategies they employ for countering everyday problems of access to water and toilets . While literature explains communities use of informal arrangements and political engagement to access water what is less clear is why similar strategies do not emerge in the case of toilets . While collective action literature focuses on community level factors such as social capital trust ethnic heterogeneity and intermediary organizations it often ignores how services interact with the slum ecology and the institutional frameworks they are embedded within . Caste gender religion class and influential slum leaders no doubt mediate everyday social relations in Indian slums but communities that surmount these obstacles may still not be able to mobilize in a way that improves everyday service delivery . I argue that communities are able to coordinate when they think their efforts will yield success both locally in terms of inducing reciprocity and reducing free riding as well as when they get appropriate institutional support for their initiatives . Infrastructural characteristics unique to a service determine whether reciprocity and cooperation can be sustained within the built environment of the slum . Bureaucratic complexity determines whether communities will be able to negotiate successfully . In the case of water easy adaptability within the neighborhood and ease of bureaucratic access allow for sustained coordination within communities . The infrastructural nature of toilets makes it harder to find arrangements that will work within the slum ecology and induce cooperation . The complicated institutional dynamics create obstacles on top of that deter sustained mobilization . What communities experience instead is a sporadic pattern of collective action around poorly functioning public toilets .,Different public services induce different types of mobilization strategies producing intra slum variation. Long term cooperative action as observed around piped water is not replicated in the case of toilets. Adaptability of the service within the built environment of the slum determines the type of mobilization. Bureaucratic institutional complexity which differs by service also determines community strategies. A combination of the above two factors lead to sporadic collective action in the case of toilets.
160,Numerous empirical studies have sought to compare corruption across regions or countries . It is however individuals who are corrupt not regions or countries . Studies of corruption should therefore investigate individual behavior . This has not been previously possible other than in survey responses on payment of bribes because of lack of data . We use individual level data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank to investigate bribe taking among officials in local government public administration and parallel Party bureaucracies . We find that bribes that officials received systematically increase with positions at higher levels of official hierarchies . Economic authority to decide on spending and regulation is associated with receiving greater bribes than being in administrative positions . Consistent with life cycle incentives entry level and retirement approaching officials take higher bribes than middle aged officials . Being more educated does not deter corruption but on the contrary is associated with taking higher bribes . Gender is not correlated with the size of the bribes taken . We link our empirical results on bribes to the theory of rent seeking in bureaucratic hierarchies .,We study corruption at the level of individual public officials. We use novel data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank. Officials at higher levels and with economic authority tend to take larger bribes. Officials at entry level and approaching retirement tend to take larger bribes. Being more educated is positively correlated with the size of the bribes taken.
161,The pervading force of corruption across the globe remains a major concern among nations multilateral agencies such as Transparency International and more profoundly in major business and public policy discourses . For many developing countries especially those with weak institutions high levels of corruption are causatively associated with high levels of poverty poor economic performance and under development . This research explores the growing incidence of corruption in Morocco which has stunted the countrys positive development . This research situates the treatment of corruption within the conceptual frame of social marketinga demonstrably robust platform for analysing societal issues and indeed a validated behavioural intervention model . A two pronged data collection method was applied based on the positivistic paradigm and involving a total of 1000 respondents with about 792 questionnaires fully or partially completed . Data analysis was accomplished through the use of logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques to remove socio demographics biases . Findings based on micro level data revealed that the campaign did manage to raise awareness among the public by about 60 per cent it also changed perceptions about corruption with a modest but significant 8.2 per cent increase among population perceiving corruption as immoral . Similarly respondents exposed to the campaign had a 20.8 per cent higher intention to change their proclivity towards corruption compared with the population not exposed to the campaignwith family influence reported as the main predictor of intention to change .,The lack of creativity of the corruption awareness campaign in Morocco resulted in low interest recall and mental processing from the audience. Findings based on micro level data show that the corruption awareness campaign raised awareness among the public by about 60 . The corruption awareness changed perceptions about corruption among population perceiving corruption as immoral. Respondents exposed to the campaign had a 20.8 higher intention to change their proclivity towards corruption unlike others not exposed to it.
162,The aim of this paper is to examine theoretically and empirically the impact of improvement in the capability to access innovation and knowledge on economic growth and convergence among countries . Our results obtained using an augmented Solow Swan growth model and panel data methodology with a sample of 138 countries for the period 19902014 show not only that improvement in the capability to access innovation and knowledge has a positive impact on said economic growth fostering the technological catch up process for developing countries and accelerating the pattern of economic convergence but also that this improvement has an even greater effect on developing countries when democracy is well developed accelerating the pattern of economic convergence even further .,Improved capability to access innovation and knowledge has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. It also fosters technological catch up process for developing countries and promotes economic convergence. Economic convergence is even greater when democracy is well developed in developing countries. Leapfrogging Hypothesis holds since the impact is greater in developing countries.
163,Governments in many less developed countries have decentralized their social support systems over the last several decades . However despite enthusiasm for these reforms evidence remains limited and mixed as to whether they improve the delivery of basic social services . I take advantage of an unexpected pause in reform implementation in Honduras due to the countrys 2009 coup to investigate the effects of decentralization on local health services . Drawing on administrative data an original survey of health workers and qualitative interviews my analysis shows that decentralization is credibly associated with increases in preventive care for women and that improved accountability and greater resilience to shocks are important mechanisms for this change . Moreover my analysis highlights how regional organizations use decentralization to assert their own influence and deflect negative political consequences while pressuring for improvements in service delivery . These findings shed light both on the possibilities for improving local social services through governance reform and how national level reforms can be leveraged by powerful actors at lower rungs of the governmental hierarchy .,Decentralized health service delivery is associated with increased production of preventive healthcare services for women. The primary mechanism for this is increased monitoring of health workers by intermediary organizations under the reform. Decentralization also insulated the Regional Health Authority from political fallout from key local actors. This allowed it to assert its influence and pressure for improved service delivery through the intermediary organizations.
164,Adoption of technology is indispensable for increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction in Sub Saharan Africa . Lack of access to credit is often identified as a constraint on the adoption of agricultural technology . Recently microcredit has generated considerable enthusiasm and hope for ensuring sustainable financial inclusion of the poor . We conducted randomized control trial to examine the impact of microcredit on the adoption of technology and productivity of rice cultivation in Tanzania . Collaboratively with BRAC a globally known microfinance institution we offered microcredit specifically designed for agriculture to randomly selected farmers . We estimate the intention to treat effect as well as the local average treatment effect of microcredit by using the treatment status as an instrumental variable . Overall we find no evidence that the BRAC program increases the use of chemical fertilizer . Also credit use does not result in an increase in paddy yield profit from rice cultivation or household income . Our results from sub sample analyses suggest that credit does not increase the fertilizer use by those who have better access to irrigation water as they have already applied the amount of fertilizer near to the recommended level . On the other hand credit increases the fertilizer use by those who have limited access to irrigation water and have previously used little fertilizer . However possibly due to the poor yield response to fertilizer the increase in chemical fertilizer use does not result in higher yield for them . We also observed similar phenomenon for the comparison between trained and non trained borrowers before the intervention . Our study suggests that improving credit access may not be enough to increase small scale farmers technology adoption agricultural productivity and welfare .,Does microcredit improve the adoption of agricultural technology and productivity. We conducted a randomized control trial of microcredit in Tanzania. We found that credit did not increase technology adoption or productivity of rice. Improving access to credit may not suffice to enhance agricultural productivity.
165,Over the past decade academic and policy communities have given significant attention to the potential connections between climate change and conflict . While the degree to which climate change alters conflict outcomes remains a topic of considerable debate in academic communities policy organizations are already being tasked with incorporating climate conflict into policy and programming . This article investigates how climate conflict discourses inform development policy and in turn how the structures of development enable or constrain institutions ability to address climate conflict priorities . Drawing upon mixed methods and multi sited data collection including nine months of participant observation interviews a survey of local government officials and a document review I investigated the ways in which development practitioners seek to address climate conflict . Data collection focused on two particular programs being implemented by Mercy Corps an international humanitarian and development NGO in Karamoja Uganda a region emerging from a period of violent conflict manifesting largely between ethnically defined pastoralist groups . In examining how the wider discourses of climate conflict inform these programs I demonstrate why there exists such a wide disparity between the demand for development programming that addresses the conflict risks of climate change and the distinct lack of clarity regarding what such programming might entail . More specifically I identify the following overlapping challenges facing development agencies seeking to address climate conflict complex spatial scales across disconnected geographies imprecise and limiting discursive framings and challenges related to program governance . In addition to identifying these barriers I also demonstrate that clearer paths for development intervention emerge when the narrow conceptualizations of climate conflict are widened beyond climate changes role as a driver of conflict or threat multiplier .,The discourse that frames climate change as athreat multiplier hinders conceptualizations of climate conflict interventions. The spatial disparity between climatic impacts and conflict outcomes does not align with traditional development structures. The structures of development and divergent temporalities of climate conflict complicate agencies implementation capacities. Interventions that expand beyond diagnosing climate change as a conflict driver better account for implementation barriers.
166,I estimate the effect of the minimum wage on formal wages informal wages and employment in Colombia . I exploit an unexpected increase in the real minimum wage during 1999 . My analysis combines unconditional quantile regressions with a differences in differences design . I find evidence of wage responses for wages close to the minimum wage . The increases are present in both the informal and formal sectors and are larger in the formal one . Wages around the minimum increase by around 3 percent in the formal sector for a 10 percentage points larger minimum wage incidence and by around 1 percent in the informal sector . These increases are smaller than those implied by full compliance to minimum wage policy but positive for some unaffected workers . This suggests employers partially comply with the minimum wage and use it as a reference . I find slight negative employment effects on the informal sector but not on the formal sector . The effects in the informal sector are not driven by cross sectoral effects . The results suggest the minimum wage has a direct impact on the informal labor market although they may not apply to minimum wage changes in other countries or contexts or to larger minimum wage increases .,I estimate the effect of a real minimum wage increase on wages in Colombia. I find wage responses in both sectors for wages close to the minimum wage. The effects in the informal sector are not driven by cross sectoral effects.
167,Given a widespread sense among donors that mainstream anti corruption reforms over the past 25years have failed to yield results there is a move towards more targeted interventions . Such interventions should in principle overcome implementation gaps and make it easier to evaluate impact supporting learning . However when interventions are narrowly targeted there is a risk that corrupt actors simply adapt shifting their focus to areas with weaker controls so that overall corruption is not reduced but merely displaced . We analyse data points from World Bank funded development aid tenders over 12years in 100 developing countries and observe the heterogeneous effects of a 2003 anti corruption reform aimed at increasing oversight and opening up competition . Our tight matching estimations suggest that the reform is effective in the targeted area it decreases corruption risks due to low competition . But we also find that evasive tactics largely cancel out these positive direct effects buyers switch to non treated less competitive procedure types and exploit them more intensively . Our results demonstrate how data analytics can be used to observe public procurement at the system level to inform more adaptive and effective anti corruption programming . More broadly we underline that technical interventions might not represent the best way to tackle systemic corruption instead strategies should target the root causes of corruption and contribute to building a culture of integrity .,We analyse a reform of World Bank procurement rules using global contract level data. The reform made bidding more competitive but insider firms retained market share. Government officials evaded the reform by concentrating corruption on non treated processes. Reformers should plan for evasive strategies and monitor behaviour beyond the target area. Anti corruption reforms fail if they ignore political and social drivers of corruption.
168,Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban slums areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security . This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize . Yet the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood . While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps . Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility . We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities . To address the limitations inherent in cross sectional data we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data neighborhood focus group data longitudinal satellite data and in depth qualitative interviews . While no one analysis is definitive on its own all of these results point to the same conclusion slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class . Movement out of neighborhoods particularly to non slum neighborhoods is rare . Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level and as opportunities increase volatility increases in parallel . Plateauing and volatility are features present in low end and even more in high end slums . Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility .,Slums develop at different rates but most do not convert to formal areas over time. Movement out of slums is limited and people rarely move out to non slum areas. Many slum households experience upward mobility but the level plateaus. Volatility is high in slums upward gains remain precarious for slum residents.
169,For most poor countries of today using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy . Yet in these countries investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations . Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers productivity growth in staple foods an agricultural transformation and a rural transformation . This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures . We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches . One is from the supply side where public and social agents intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption liquidity risk information and access to markets . The other is from the demand side where private agents create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains . We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches . We conclude by noting that the supply side approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success . The demand side approach has promise but received insufficient attention and is in need of additional rigorous research which we outline .,We review how agriculture based countries can use agriculture for development. An Agriculture for Development sequence aims at asset building productivity growth agricultural rural transformations. Critical instruments for success are constraint removal on technology adoption and development of inclusive value chains. These instruments can be used from the supply side with public agents and from the demand side with private agents. While the supply side has been extensively researched the demand side is less explored and we offer a research agenda.
170,Malnutrition remains a problem across India particularly among women and children in rural areas . In response nutrition sensitive agriculture programs have emerged which promote activities such as crop diversification nutrition education and womens empowerment . While research has assessed whether NSA programs have an impact on nutrition indicators less work has examined whether such programs are equitable in distributive procedural and recognitional terms . This study investigates how one non governmental organization working through women led self help groups in eastern India has incorporated NSA practices into its traditional focus of improving cereal productivity and promoting cash crops . Given that both research sites in northern Jharkhand and eastern Madhya Pradesh have seen agricultural practices shift from more diverse traditional cropping to high yielding rice over the past decade this research examines womens responses to these new NSA promotion efforts . This 11 month study employed ethnographic methods including participant observation and 117 interviews with village women along with NGO and government workers across both sites . This analysis employed an equity framework based on the decolonial concept of cognitive justice which asserts that epistemological inequity precedes socioeconomic inequities . The findings suggest while all respondents reacted positively to the tenets of NSA promotion due to high yielding paddys labor requirements and cultural aspirations to maximize rice production many farmers were unable to adopt NSA practices robustly . While poorer farmers not growing improved paddy were better positioned to adopt NSA many were less active in SHG activities due to structural barriers and an observed lack of cognitive justice . As NSA programs are still emerging little research has detailed the ways such efforts may exacerbate or allay rural inequities . This study suggests NSA could have more impact on cropping practices and nutrition outcomes if it led with an equity approach centered on cognitive justice .,Nutrition sensitive agriculture NSA projects are increasingly common yet little research has examined its equity aspects. Paddy transplanting which is labor and time intensive was a main barrier to adoption of NSA practices. Not all farmers transplanted paddy and there were a cultural politics of modern paddy promoted in self help groups SHGs . Due to recognitional and economic barriers some farmers were not active in SHG activities or shared in benefits of NSA. For NSA programs to be more effective they should use an approach based on recognitional equity and cognitive justice.
171,This paper investigates the intergenerational effects of maternal education on child health in 68 developing countries across five continents over nearly three decades . Exploiting the between sisters variation in the educational attainment of the mothers we find that mothers education is positively associated with child health measured by the three most commonly used indices namely height for age weight for height and weight for age . Our mechanism analyses further show that these favorable effects could be at least in part attributed to fertility behavior assortative matching health care utilization access to information health knowledge and labor market outcome . Given the long lasting impacts of early life health over the life cycle our findings underline the importance of maternal education in improving economic and social conditions in developing countries .,We investigate the effects of maternal education on child health. Our sample covers 68 developing countries. We find that maternal education is positively associated with child health. A comprehensive mechanism analysis is conducted.
172,Fair Trade certification aims at transferring wealth from the consumer to the farmer however coffee passes through many hands before reaching final consumers . Bringing together retail wholesale and stock market data this study estimates how much more consumers are paying for Fair Trade certified coffee in US supermarkets and finds estimates around 1.50 per lb . The study then assesses how this price premium is split between the different stages of the value chain most of the premium goes to the roasters profit margin while the retailer surprisingly makes smaller absolute profits on Fair Trade certified coffee compared to conventional coffee . In the period studied in this study the coffee farmer receives about a sixth of the price premium paid by the consumer .,Fair Trade labels play an increasing role in marketing coffee in industrialized countries. Consumers pay about 1.50 extra per pound of Fair Trade certified coffee compared to non labeled. Most of the Fair Trade premium paid by consumers goes to coffee roasters. Fair Trade label reduces retailer profit margins to the benefit of roasters.
173,Breastfeeding has significant health and human capital effects on both mothers and infants . However breastfeeding rates vary significantly within and across countries as societal political economic and cultural factors along with individual choices shape the breastfeeding practices . Using data from the Egyptian Demographic and Health Surveys this study examines the effects of first motherhood timing availability of breastmilk substitutes and mothers education levels on breastfeeding duration in a major developing country Egypt . The empirical analysis which corrects for the estimation errors that plagued previous research shows that delaying the first motherhood timing and increasing the availability of infant formulas have statistically significant negative effects on breastfeeding duration . Furthermore breastfeeding duration is found to be decreasing in mothers education levels .,Breastfeeding has significant health and human capital effects. Breastfeeding is affected by societal political economic and individual factors. Delaying the first motherhood timing reduces breastfeeding duration. Increasing the availability of infant formulas reduces breastfeeding duration. Breastfeeding duration decreases in mothers education levels.
174,Integrated approaches providing assistance to jobless individuals through the combination of income support and active labour market policies have been increasingly advocated in the policy debate both by policy makers and international organizations . By helping people tackle immediate needs while promoting labour market reinsertion these combined approaches are expected to improve labour market and social conditions in a sustainable manner . However evidence on the effectiveness of this policy approach is extremely scant in emerging and developing economies . This paper studies a pivotal example of this policy trend through the evaluation of a public works programme provided alongside a cash transfer as part of a comprehensive social assistance programme that reached around 10 per cent of households in Uruguay between 2005 and 2007 . We use rich administrative data of panel nature to study the effects of participating in the public works programme receiving the cash transfer and benefiting jointly of the active and income support programmes . Results on measures of labour market participation employment quality and civil society participation are non significant across the board . Point estimates are nevertheless of the expected sign and of reasonable magnitude suggesting that the programme came close to achieving its objective . Possible reasons of the limited effectiveness of the programme could include limited treatment intensity and lack of human capital accumulation .,We study the impact of a comprehensive cash transfer programme implemented in Uruguay. The programme combines income support with participation in a public works scheme. We find no statistically significant effects on labour market and social outcomes. Point estimates nevertheless are of the expected sign and reasonable magnitude. Limited support to human capital accumulation might have hindered effectiveness.
175,When applied to the analysis of natural resource management the theory of access has led to a number of interesting findings in particular an insistence on the role of power relations in the conditions that regulate access to resources . By adopting the capability approach for this study we move beyond the theory of access in a bid to explain the unequal access to use of natural resources . We focus on three key types of power strategic institutional and structural . We then apply our approach to the case of Cte dIvoire and demonstrate how changes in power since the 1960s have caused increasing or decreasing opportunities of access to use of natural resources for certain populations . The mechanisms we describe help elucidate the issue of resource degradation .,Natural resource degradation is exacerbated by population heterogeneity. Population heterogeneity is linked to forms of power that accentuate or diminish access to and use of natural resources. The capability approach is relevant as an analytical framework because it highlights changes in power over time.
176,As Indias population has been ageing due to declines in fertility and mortality rates more policy emphasis has been placed on reducing poverty among the elderly . The present study aims to examine the effect of Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme on household welfare indicators such as consumption expenditure income assets and poverty . Using the household longitudinal data based on the India Human Development Survey in 20045 and 201112 we have applied the Propensity Score Matching to build a counterfactual group and have used the propensity score weighted fixed effects model to eliminate time invariant unobservable household characteristics . The results show that the IGNOAPS participation increased consumption expenditure food and non food expenditure and assets while reducing the household labour supply . The sub sample estimations show that these effects are observed only when recipients are women . However the results of Difference in Difference model imply that the poverty reducing effect deteriorated in 201112 after the government made several changes to programme specifications in 2007 . This was likely because some households which accessed IGNOAPS after 2007 reduced the labour supply significantly while keeping the level of consumption .,This paper finds that participation in IGNOAPS has a strong positive effect on various household welfare dimensions. Welfare dimensions studied here includes monthly consumption expenditure food non food expenditures and household assets. The program has a negative effect on household labour supply. The sub sample estimations show that these effects are observed only when recipients are women. Poverty reducing effect deteriorated in 201112 after the government made several changes to programme specifications.
177,Sustained interest by the business community in commercial agriculture in the global South has been welcomed for its potential to bring capital into long neglected rural areas but has also raised concerns over implications for customary land rights and the terms of integration of local land and labor into global supply chains . In global development policy and discourse the concept of inclusive business has become central in efforts to resolve these tensions with the idea that integrating smallholders and other disadvantaged actors into partnerships with agribusiness firms can generate benefits for national economies private investors and local livelihoods . Scholarly treatment of the topic has tended to be polarized into win lose narratives or points to the contingency and social differentiation of localized experiences . This review paper takes a different approach exploring published evidence on the structural factors shaping agricultural value chains and their implications for social inclusion . We develop a typology of seven agricultural value chains and use this to select a sample of crops in specific world regions for an analysis of how structural factors in value chain relations from crop features to market dynamics and policy drivers affect social inclusion . Such an approach allows us to ask whether inclusive agribusiness is a realistic goal given the broader structuring of agribusiness and the global economic system . Our study finds that while the characteristics of specific crops and supply chains exert a strong influence on opportunities and constraints to inclusion the overall trend is towards more,We critically examine the concept and practice of inclusive business by analysing evidence across agricultural value chains. Structural factors constrain space for inclusiveness leading to growing. clusion for smallholders and employees. The inclusive business concept obscures these factors by focusing attention on the behavior of individual businesses. Inclusive agrarian trajectories hinge on a re think of the role played by public policy finance and gate keeper functions.
178,This article examines post 2011 transformations of economic governance in the MENA region . It argues that Arab regimes have responded to the threats posed by the 2011 uprisings not by embracing appeals for inclusive social contracts but through the imposition of repressive exclusionary social pacts in which previously universal economic and social rights of citizens are being redefined as selective benefits . These pacts are shown to represent a significant shift in economic governance and in state society relations in the MENA region evident in the growing institutionalization of contingent citizenship as a framework for the organization of state society relations and the management of social policy . In stressing discontinuities in economic governance this argument challenges claims that the reassertion of authoritarianism in Arab states after 2011 represents a back to the future process exhibiting little change from the formally inclusive social pacts associated with pre 2011 models of authoritarian governance .,After the uprisings of 2011 authoritarian regimes in MENA have worked to consolidate repressive exclusionary social pacts. These pacts express contingent conceptions of citizenship and securitize economic governance. The transition to repressive exclusionary social pacts is a significant shift in authoritarian norms and practices in MENA. This shift forecloses possibilities for establishing inclusive participatory social contracts in the MENA region.
179,Evidence suggests that major events like war or natural disasters affect risk attitudes . This paper shows that similar effects can also be associated with institutional changes such as improved property rights . Using the case of a large titling program in Peru we find that the program reduced risk aversion . The effects are sizable persistent and seem to be driven by improved security of tenure . These results highlight an understudied channel through which property rights could shape economic outcomes .,Evidence from a large urban titling program in Peru. Improved property rights lead to a sizable and persistent reduction in risk aversion. Effects seem to be driven at least in part by changes in background risk.
180,Expatriate workers remittances represent an important source of financing for low and middle income countries . No consensus however has yet emerged regarding the effect of remittances on economic growth . In a quantitative survey of 538 estimates reported in 95 studies we find that approximately 40 of the studies report a positive effect 40 report no effect and 20 report a negative effect . Our results indicate publication bias in favor of positive effects . Correcting for the bias using recently developed techniques we find that the mean effect of remittances on growth is still positive but economically small . Nevertheless our results uncover noticeable regional differences remittances are growth enhancing in Asia but not in Africa . Studies that do not control for alternative sources of external finance such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment mismeasure the effect of remittances . Finally time series studies and studies ignoring endogeneity issues report systematically larger effects of remittances on growth .,We conduct the first meta analysis of the effect of remittances on economic growth. Our results indicate publication bias in favor of positive effects. The mean effect of remittances on growth is still positive but economically small. Remittances are growth enhancing in Asia but not in Africa. Controlling for aid is important to estimate the growth effects of remittances.
181,We examine the design and implementation of the United Nations Flash Appeal triggered in response to the highly destructive 2015 Nepal earthquake . We consider how local need and various distortions affect the proposed project number the proposed financial amount and the subsequent funding decision by aid donors . Specifically we investigate the extent to which the allocation of this humanitarian assistance follows municipalities affectedness and their physical and socio economic vulnerabilities . We then analyze potential ethnic religious and political distortions . Our results show that aid allocation is associated with geophysical estimates of the earthquake damage . Controlled for disaster impact however aid allocation shows little regard for the specific socio economic and physical vulnerabilities . It is also worrisome that the allocation of the flash appeal commitments favors municipalities dominated by higher castes and disadvantages those with a greater distance to the Nepali capital Kathmandu .,Study of design and implementation of the 2015 UN Nepal Earthquake Flash Appeal. Municipality level analysis of proposed and funded aid projects. Aid commitments are associated with the disasters destructiveness. Aid decisions show little regard for socio economic and physical vulnerabilities. Municipalities dominated by higher castes favored and remote areas neglected.
182,Food has become both a pivotal topic in development and a lens through which to integrate and address a range of contemporary global challenges . This review article addresses in particular the interrelationship between food and sustainable equitable development arguing that this is fundamentally political . We offer a set of approaches to understanding food politics each underlain by broader theoretical traditions in power analysis focused respectively on,Current food systems are unsustainable and inequitable requiring political transformation to meet development goals. Understanding food politics requires combining plural approaches underpinned by diverse theories of power. Problematiques around food production consumption and nutrition illustrate material and knowledge politics across scales. A 4Ds framework highlights Directions Distribution Diversity and Democracy in pathways of food system change. Future food politics research agendas require triangulation amongst approaches interdisciplinarity and engagement.
183,The Sustainable Development Goals require countries to halve poverty in all its dimensions by 2020 but the dimensions are nowhere specified . Reflecting the United Nations aspiration that policy should be informed by the meaningful participation of persons living in poverty participative research was undertaken in six contrasting countries to identify the dimensions of poverty . People experiencing poverty were involved at all stages of the research as members of national research teams alongside academics and practitioners . The core methodology Merging of Knowledge entailed recruitment in each country of people in poverty social welfare practitioners and specialist academics their participation in extended parallel groupwork in order to specify the dimensions of poverty and meetings between representatives of all three groups to seek consensus . Consensus was achieved at national level as it subsequently was at international level with representatives from all six countries . Nine dimensions of poverty were recognised only three of which are commonly included in existing measures disempowerment suffering in body mind and heart struggle and resistance social maltreatment institutional maltreatment unrecognised contribution lack of decent work insufficient income and material and social deprivation . Five factors were determined to influence the manifestation of the dimensions cultural beliefs identity location environment and environmental policy and timing and duration . The research suggests that it may be possible to view poverty in the global North and South through a single perspective creating a template for the development and evaluation of policy while also stimulating work on new indicators of poverty .,People experiencing poverty welfare workers and academics agree on the dimensions of poverty. Only three of the nine recognised dimensions of poverty are regularly measured. It is now possible to discuss and address poverty in the global North and South based a single conceptualisation. The nine dimensions of poverty provide a template for developing and evaluating anti poverty programmes.
184,Supermarkets have gained in importance in the food systems of many developing countries with profound implications for smallholder farmers . Several studies analyzed effects of selling to supermarkets on smallholder productivity and income . However no previous work systematically analyzed effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices even though prices are important determinants of farmers profits and livelihoods . Here we use data from smallholder vegetable growers in India to compare output prices received in supermarket and traditional market channels . We also quantify farmers transport and transaction costs in both channels . Even after controlling for quality differences prices are significantly higher in supermarket channels . Positive price effects are confirmed through hedonic price models and propensity score matching . Average effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices are in a magnitude of 20 or more . Higher farmgate prices are due to fewer intermediaries and lower transaction costs in supermarket channels . In the absence of binding contracts supermarkets also need to pay higher prices to ensure regular supply of high quality vegetables . These results suggest that the rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency with positive effects on farmgate prices and revenues .,Effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices for vegetables analyzed with data from India. Differences in quality and transaction costs between supermarket and traditional channels. Also after controlling for these differences prices paid in supermarket channels are higher. Net price effects are in a magnitude of 20 or more for most vegetable types. The rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency and farm revenues.
185,Over two centuries Colombia transferred vast quantities of public land into private hands . Much of this process was justified publicly in terms of giving land to the landless and reducing rural poverty . And yet Colombia retains one of the highest concentrations of land ownership in the world . Why Analyzing the period 19602010 we show that the effects of public land distribution across 1100 municipalities are highly heterogeneous . Where small and medium sized farms dominate land distribution increased average farm size decreased land inequality and accelerated local development . But where land was concentrated in the hands of a rural elite distributed land was diverted to bigger farms resulting in fewer small and more large farms greater plot size dispersion and lower levels of development . We explore whether these effects flow through voter turnout political competition or public expenditure and taxation . Land distribution increases turnout makes politics more competitive and increases public service provision . But landed elites use patron client ties to distort local policy and decision making to their benefit . Land distributions secondary institutional effects on the distribution of power outweigh its primary effects on the distribution of land .,Colombia granted huge tracts of public land to poor farmers since 1960. We study the heterogeneous effects of land grants on all 1100 municipalities. In small farmers districts inequality fell and development improved. In elite districts land concentration and inequality rose and development fell. How Elites use patron client ties to distort local policies to their benefit.
186,Violence against children and adolescents a highly prevalent problem is a clear violation of child rights and has detrimental effects on later life outcomes . Programs that alleviate poverty address a structural determinant of child vulnerability and can thereby reduce child abuse . This paper investigates whether the Government of Zimbabwes Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Program which combines cash transfers with complementary services affects youth exposure to physical violence . The analysis uses data from a non experimental impact evaluation and a difference in differences approach . Results show a 19 percentage point decline in the incidence of physical violence among youth four years into the program . HSCT induced enhancements in beneficiary households purchasing capacity and food security improvements in caregiver subjective well being and reductions in youth participation in economic work for pay could be mediating the programs effects on youth abuse . This paper adds to the relatively scarce evidence on the impacts of anti poverty policies on young peoples susceptibility to physical violence in developing countries .,A program providing cash transfers and child support services in Zimbabwe reduces youth exposure to physical abuse. Physical violence among youth aged 13 to 24years declines by 19 percentage points four years into the program. Improvements in household food security and caregiver subjective well being could be channeling the reductions in violence.
187,This study focused on the concept of nutritional loss and waste aimed to estimate the nutritional losses derived from food losses worldwide estimating the number of people that could be fed with the amount of food loss worldwide and confronting such estimate with the prevalence of undernourished people worldwide . We analyzed data on the estimated amount of food losses considering different food types in nations worldwide published by the Food and Agriculture Organization . The investigation estimated the amounts of kilocalories and proteins for each food item available in the FAOs Food Balance Sheets . Data regarding energy and protein losses were converted into the feeding potential metric that evaluates the number of adult individuals that could be fed with the nutritional losses . The study uses the balance of feeding potential obtained through the FP minus the prevalence of undernourished population . The results show that the total production of the main food groups in the world has drastically increased in the last decades and the rate of loss for such food groups remains constant or slightly growing . Moreover the results suggest that the amount of food losses registered by the FAO in 2017 would be enough to feed about 940 million adult individuals being enough to feed the amount of undernourished people in the world . Furthermore some countries present high levels of BFP such as the United States Brazil and China . In contrast some other countries such as India and Pakistan show lower levels of BFP . Policymakers and private sector agents involved in global food systems should be focusing their attention on increasing supply chain efficiency and reducing food loss and waste and NLW on a global scale . This study encourages the definition of an international treaty committing nations to significantly reduce their FLW and NLW levels .,Nutritional Loss and Waste NLS represents the nutritional potential derived from food loss and waste. Feeding potential FP is the number of adult individuals that could be fed with food losses. Worlds food production is increasing and the rate of food losses follows this grow. Worlds food losses in 2017 would be enough to feed about 940 million adult individuals. Investigations on nutritional production and waste can help to promote global food security.
188,Over the last 50years Malaysia has seen one of the fastest rates of income poverty reduction in the world . This came alongside falling overall income inequality due in large part to a national policy effort to address ethnic inequalities in the wake of tragic race riots in 1969 . The first paper in the two part series examined various measures of ethnic inequality . This second paper assesses the role that changes in between group inequality played in Malaysias success against poverty . To address this question a new decomposition method is applied to survey data spanning 50years . The results indicate that ethnic redistribution helped reduce poverty but it was not as important as within group redistribution or mean income growth . A pure ethnic redistribution effect is defined and isolated empirically . Sizable potential gains to the countrys poor from ethnic redistribution are revealed in the 1970s suggesting that the early policy effort made sense . The absolute gains have faded over time and are now small though the elasticity of national poverty to ethnic redistribution remains quite high .,Ethnic redistribution helped reduce poverty in Malaysia over the last 50years. However it was not as important as within group redistribution or mean income growth. The absolute gains to poor people from ethnic redistribution were once high but have faded.
189,The race riots that broke out in Kuala Lumpur in May 1969 triggered a national public effort to greatly reduce both Malaysias longstanding ethnic inequalities and its high incidence of poverty . This paper studies how various measures of ethnic inequality evolved since 1969 . Two conceptual distinctions are emphasized that between income inequality and polarization and that between relative and absolute inequality . Over the last 50years the poorest ethnic group the Bumiputera have had the highest growth rate of household incomes which helped assure a long term decline in relative between group inequality which substantially reduced overall income inequality . Measures of ethnic polarization moved highly synchronously with between group inequality . The differential growth rates by ethnicity were not enough to prevent rising absolute inequality given the extent of the initial ethnic disparities . Despite the progress against relative inequality Malaysias absolute disparities by ethnicity are now even larger than 50years ago . The second paper of this two part paper examines the contribution of lower relative ethnic inequality to the country s progress against poverty .,The race riots in May 1969 triggered a national public effort to address Malaysias ethnic inequalities. Ethnic inequality declined over 50years more so when redistributive policy was more active. Measures of ethnic polarization moved highly synchronously with ethnic inequality. Despite progress absolute disparities by ethnicity are now even larger than 50years ago.
190,While there is consensus on the need to promote agricultural development in Africa to achieve food security and use agriculture as an engine of growth there is a lively policy debate on appropriate policies to achieve this goal . In the past two decades there has been a revival of policies that favor government support to agriculture in Africa especially in the form of input subsidies . Such policies have remained highly controversial reflecting a long standing dichotomy in agricultural development policy between those who consider subsidies as essential to increase agricultural productivity and those who criticize such state focused policy instruments and favor market oriented approaches . In the literature agricultural policy choices have mainly been analyzed using models that capture economic or political interests . Some studies have focused on policy beliefs to explain the dichotomy but what has not received much attention is the use of language in agricultural policy discourses in spite of increasing evidence that narratives matter for policy making . To address this gap we combine the Advocacy Coalition Framework with Narrative Policy Analysis to examine agricultural policy discourses in Senegal . Applying a cluster analysis to coded transcripts of in depth interviews with policy stakeholders we identified two opposing advocacy coalitions and labelled them agricultural support coalition and an agricultural support critique coalition . An analysis of the argumentative structure of the narratives of each coalition revealed interesting differences while the agricultural support coalition told a range of straight forward stories that explain how government support such as input subsidies addresses the problem of low agricultural productivity the opposing coalition formulated their stories mostly in the form of critiques rather than telling equally straight forward counter stories . Based on the analysis we examine possible,Analyzing narratives is important but has been neglected in agricultural policy analysis. We combine the Advocacy Coalition Framework with Narrative Policy Analysis. We identified two advocacy coalitions reflecting a dichotomy in perspectives. One tells straightforward stories while the other one formulates mostly critiques. Successful meta narratives which could bridge the dichotomy are yet to be developed.
191,Processes of industrialisation have long been associated with labour productivity improvements rising incomes and ultimately economic and social development . The preferred policy strategy to achieve these development objectives however remain intensely debated . A specific policy strategy of resource based industrialisation involving pre export value addition to raw materials is frequently pursued by resource rich countries in the global south . We apply the analytical framework of Global Production Network theory and its central notion of strategic coupling to the case of cocoa processing in Indonesia . Our findings demonstrate that the apparent success of an RBI policy in encouraging growth of a domestic cocoa processing sector primarily through the use of export restrictions is highly dependent on industry specific GPN dynamics . Through an assessment of downstreaming policies in Indonesia this paper provides an explanation for the success and limitations of such industrial policies in the contemporary global economy . Industry outcomes are strongly influenced by Indonesia s position within a set of globally connected networks and the alignment of national policy with the particular strategies of lead firms within these networks in a processes of strategic coupling . We further argue that the inherent importance of upstream supply within resource based industrialisation demands further attention when applying concepts of strategic coupling to this particular policy framework .,The recent resurgence in resource based industrialisation RBI policies has had variable success. Variation in RBI outcomes is explained by the strategic coupling of regions with lead firm strategies. Sub optimal RBI outcomes in the Indonesia cocoa sector is due to policy neglect of prevailing lead firm strategies. Effective RBI policies require enhanced attention to the sustainability of domestic resource supplies.
192,Within the last decades globalization has changed the international seafood trade allowing low income countries to access markets in high income countries and vice versa . Nevertheless the effects of globalization are controversial and in particular the impacts on small scale fishers and local fish traders are unclear . This paper examines the economic effects of globalization on a local fish market in Katima Mulilo Namibia along the Zambezi River and near the border with Zambia . Using market data from January 2008 to December 2016 we test two hypotheses . First we test if the local market is integrated with global markets . Second we test whether local prices are increasing and associated with positive terms of trade . Using time series methods and hedonic models results show that the Katima market is linked to the world market and local fish traders receive higher prices over time as predicted by an increasingly globalized seafood trade .,Analyzes data from an inland fish market in Namibia where small scale fish traders sell freshwater fish. The inland fish market in Namibia is integrated into global markets. Fish traders receive higher real prices consistent with trade competition and access to high income global markets. Market integration and rising prices reflect new transportation and market infrastructure and increasing of globalization.
193,Chinese overseas companies remain a black box in the bourgeoning China Africa research . Less is known about how inter state diplomacy firm strategies and employee agency interact to shape the workplace dynamics of Chinese investment in Africa . This article first develops a variegated work regimes framework that integrates path dependent processual and relational perspectives to capture the heterogeneous and constantly evolving relationships among state capital and labor to influence the construction and transformation of Chinese workplaces in Africa . It then applies the framework to examine Chinese investment in Ethiopia based on empirical evidence from three flagship companies operating in construction telecommunication and automobile sectors respectively . Despite varied ownership status and industrial sectors the three companies benefit from the bilateral cooperation between China and Ethiopia to establish themselves abroad . Yet the specific local work regime of each company is intricately embedded in home and host countries with regard to institutional and financial resourcefulness market conditions industrial relations and headquarters practices . Expatriate and local employees given their diverse socio economic positions and interests are subject to different mechanisms of control and adopt varied strategies towards the Chinese management . Analyses of the three companies market entry strategies management activities and employee experiences reveal four key features of Chinese work regimes in Africa the,framework is proposed to unpack the state capital labor dynamics of Chinese overseas investment. In Ethiopia Chinese work regimes generate varying impacts on expatriates and locals. Capital labor relations is intricately embedded in home and host countries. Expatriates and locals are subject to different control mechanisms and adopt varied strategies towards Chinese management. Four key features are identified to characterize Chinese work regimes in Africa.
194,The dramatic increase in overweight obesity prevalence in India and the concomitant increase in nutrition related non communicable diseases present critical health policy challenges . This paper analyses two successive nationally representative household datasets the 201516 and 200506 National Family Health Survey rounds to discern the extent of shifts in overweight obesity prevalence underway in India and the implications for informing policy . Unique features of the study are the focus given to analysing overweight obesity across different sub populations based on gender rurality and socio economic status and the diverse pattern of the prevalence across individual states over time . A fixed effects model using state time interactions is used to analyse state level variations and time dependent effects across particular sub populations . Despite the considerable increase in the prevalence of overweight obesity over the past decade and a degree of convergence across population cohorts the results show that this has been accompanied by considerable variation and divergence between states . Our findings reveal that a select few economically advanced states most noticeably for wealthy urban female cohorts experienced negative time dependent effects where the predicted rates of overweight obesity declined over the decade . However some less developed and more populous states experienced positive time dependent effects such that by 201516 they had attained overweight obesity rates that had overtaken those of richer states . Also interestingly beyond a particular threshold education exhibits a negative relationship in the likelihood of overweight obesity for females but not for males . Policymakers need to understand the driving factors underpinning the state level differences and the changing patterns across cohorts over time and to formulate regionallybased policies that specifically target these differences rather than pursue a single policy approach . Moreover Indias health system needs to be re orientated to manage burgeoning chronic disease conditions and to address the burden placed on the poor given that such health expenditure is mostly privately incurred .,Many lesser developed states attained predicted overweight obesity prevalences that have overtaken some richer states. For some more developed states wealthy urban female cohorts experienced a decline in the overweight obesity prevalence. Education for females shows a negative threshold effect with overweight obesity but this was not observed for males. The high overweight obesity prevalence among the poorer and populous states indicates a major health crisis is looming. Policymakers must formulate policies that target state level differences rather than pursue a blanket approach.
195,In Vietnam rapid deforestation until the 1980s was followed by a period of widespread reforestation . Acclaimed as the first forest transition in Southeast Asia this turn around resulted from major environmental socio economic policy changes successes in agriculture and plantation forestry and state led efforts in upland forest protection restoration . We investigated forest trends after new shifts in forest governance towards more commodity production orientation underlining that recent advances are not irreversible . Using official provincial data and applying multivariate statistics we elicited major factors influencing cover changes of two types of physical forests in relation with changes in political forestlands of contrasting types comparing periods before and after the introduction of Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services policies . We find that a forest transition only continues if the tree plantation boom is factored into forest change . Country wide natural forest cover decreased slightly since 2006 with however regionally differentiated trends northern increases,Notions of forest transition in Vietnam imply a long term trend towards a stable forest cover. New forest policies in Vietnam largely concentrate on fostering economic productivity. Renewed deforestation has been linked to policy driven decreases in protection forestlands. Until now payment for forest ecosystem service policies had no visible effect to counter forest loss. Aspects of good governance are important for a sustainable transition in forestry.
196,The Swachh Bharat and US 94 This study shows the sanitation improvements under the SBM are highly cost beneficial more when communities are free of open defecation with all households using private improved sanitation facilities . Future SBM investments must ensure not only sustaining the universal toilet coverage and usage but also ensure safe faecal waste management so that households continue to enjoy full benefits of sanitation .,This study reports the first economic analysis of the Clean India Mission SBM . Annual economic gains from household sanitation are worth US 727 per household. The average price paid for a toilet is US 396 which is double the subsidy received. Financial returns on household spending over 10 years is 1.7 times the cost. Returns to society on total spending over 10 years is 4.3 times the cost. The poorest have a financial return of 2.6 and societal return of 5.7 times the cost.
197,The Sustainable Development Goals have been heralded as a landmark achievement and a major opportunity for transformative and inclusive change towards sustainability . This promise however remains largely unverified . To help fill this gap we examine how the SDGs have been taken up in the domestic politics of agri food governance a salient and contested policy area in three South American countries Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay . Our empirical assessment is based on a scoping of the institutions set up for domestic SDG governance document analysis of the first voluntary national reviews on the SDGs and 63 key informant interviews . The analysis shows that the ability of the SDGs to strengthen inclusiveness is largely shaped by domestic politics pre existing institutions and power relations as well as the resources capacities and prior experiences of civil society and subnational governments . In practice the SDGs emphasis on inclusion does not necessarily mean that a wider range of perspectives are taken into account in domestic contexts . In Paraguay the implementation of the SDGs so far mirrors the patterns of marginalization evident also in other policy processes . In Uruguay and Brazil the SDGs have offered possibilities for at least drawing attention to a variety of perspectives by strengthening the already existing fairly open political institutions in the case of Uruguay and by opening up a space for contestation by civil society organizations and subnational governments in the case of Brazil . The SDGs may then be an opportunity for change but there is also a risk that they become a justification for business as usual . Actors now employ metonymy as a tactic cherry picking preferred goals or targets as a sign of supposed adherence to the whole 2030 Agenda . Further research is needed with more ex post analyses of the SDGs beyond the praising of their nominal transformative potential .,The SDGs ability to strengthen inclusiveness is heavily shaped by domestic politics institutions and power relations. Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay present very different cases of how the SDGs play out in domestic agri food governance. The capacity resources and international networks of civil society organizations affect the way they engage with the SDGs. There is a risk that the SDGs legitimize business as usual and entrench marginalization rather than support transformation. Actors may shift from exploiting the vagueness of sustainability as a concept to cherry picking from the broad set of goals.
198,The globalized world economy has been affected by the COVID 19 pandemic since early February 2020 . In the midst of this global public health crisis a prompt review of the counterinsurgencies that have occurred in different jurisdictions is helpful . This article examines the experience of Hong Kong which successfully limited its number of confirmed cases to approximately 1100 until early June 2020 . Considering the limited actions that the government has taken against the pandemic we emphasize the prominent role of Hong Kongs civil society through highlighting the strong and spontaneous mobilization of its local communities originating from their experiences during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the social unrest in 2019 as well as their doubts regarding the pandemic assessments and recommendations of the HKSAR and WHO authorities . This article suggests that the influence of civil society should not be overlooked in the context of pandemic management .,Terrific SARS experience and citizens distrust to government have remarkable impacts on COVID 19 in Hong Kong. Self discipline of citizens contributes to the low infection rate. Districts with pro democratic councilors are more proactive in community mobilization in anti pandemic.
199,Participatory governance is a means of making the state more responsive and accountable to its citizens . However attempts to involve end users in decision making are often met with considerable resistance not just from political elites but from the bureaucracy . I investigate how and why bureaucrats resist such reforms by focusing on the implementation of the Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities Act in Pakistan an Irrigation Management Transfer program that attempted to put farmers in charge of water allocation revenue collection and dispute resolution . Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in 2015 and 2019 with bureaucrats across the administrative hierarchy and water sector practitioners and consultants I emphasise the role bureaucratic perceptions and incentives played in driving this program into the ground over two decades . My argument is two pronged . First I show that bureaucratic resistance to participatory programs needs to be studied in light of wider political events and processes particularly patterns of political engagement and parallel attempts at devolving power . Second I find that the precarious conditions under which irrigation bureaucrats work make them unwilling to cede what official power and influence they do have to farmers . In other words I contend that bureaucratic resistance to farmers involvement in decision making is the result of a more nuanced set of political and bureaucratic experiences than the perceived technical superiority and colonial inheritance of the irrigation bureaucracy . More broadly my argument has implications for participatory reforms in other sectors and for decentralized government in Pakistan and in other countries in the Global South .,Bureaucratic resistance can stymie participatory reforms while maintaining a facade of compliance to satisfy donors. Such resistance is influenced by patterns of policy development and implementation political contestation and patronage. Professional precarity leads irrigation bureaucrats to resist ceding their official power and influence to farmers. Accounting for resistance to participatory approaches requires an investigation of contemporary politics and incentives.
200,South Korea s response is considered by many as one the most effective models against COVID 19 . The average number of new cases per day fell to 6.4 in the first week of May and currently 90 of all confirmed cases have fully recovered after a massive outbreak in February 29 . First South Korea has flattened the curve of COVID 19 by combining testing early isolation and free treatment of positive cases combined with digital technologies without taking to lockdown measures . Second South Korea has been holding press briefings twice a day and disclosed all information on COVID 19 to the public in an open and transparent manner . Third South Korea has worked to secure the civic participation and voluntary engagement of citizens and businesses . The South Korean approach to COVID 19 may be difficult to emulate even for countries like the U.S. and U.K. but provides important policy implications for developing countries and needs for strengthening three core competencies against the outbreak of an epidemic digital technology efficient health governance and civic partnership . It is a great challenge for developing countries to fight alone against COVID 19 . As such the international community should work to strengthen these core competencies accordingly .,The South Korean approach to COVID 19 may be difficult to emulate but provides important implications for developing countries. Developing countries should strengthen the following core competencies digital technology efficient governance and civic partnership. Developing country should be open and transparent in disclosing all information on COVID 19 to the public. When conducting an epidemiological survey there should be adequate measures safeguarding the privacy of infected individuals.
201,The World Bank emphasizes land reform as a key pro poor intervention expecting the transfer of land to the rural poor to trigger a straight transition from poverty and subsistence to entrepreneurial and commercial smallholder farming . This article asks how and why World Bank prescriptions change in response to developments on the ground that contradict initial expectations to show that the transition to commercialization is hardly a straight one as it involves contradictory elements . It builds on an analysis of close to twenty years of World Bank reports on land reform in four post communist countries to show how and why the transfer of land and commercialization end up contradicting rather than mutually supporting each other . The analysis shows that as a result of this contradiction WB inspired policies prioritize commercialization over poverty reduction and their underlying understanding of poverty has changed from poverty as lack of farmland to poverty as lack of alternatives to farming . For the World Bank the problem in these countries is not so much the failure of having pro poor results but the decreasing control over smallholders perceived to have responded to insufficient reforms by withdrawing from markets into subsistence . Yet the analysis further suggests that even though presently seen as a sign of underdevelopment the subsistence capacity of local populations following land transfers was in earlier reports encouraged as it was believed to have the effect of supporting the commercialization of the sector and relieving welfare systems . This aspect of reforms is now relatively rarely mentioned and subsistence is assumed to be an effect of anything but reforms cast instead as a sign of insufficient market creation .,World Bank advocates land reform as crucial pro poor policy. Results of land reforms in post communist countries have at best been mixed. Mixed record might be due to conflicting World Bank objectives poverty reduction and entrepreneurship promotion. World Bank reports change from understanding poverty as lack of assets to poverty as due to informal arrangements. The study analyses World Bank reports on Moldova Romania Tajikistan and Ukraine.
202,The COVID 19 pandemic is increasing the need for international food assistance and disrupting the supply and delivery of food assistance . A series of unprecedented shocks is straining the capacity of food assistance organizations to reach vulnerable populations . We discuss how the COVID 19 pandemic is affecting the demand and the supply of international food assistance and we propose three policy changes that can keep food flowing to those in need . First donor countries can prioritize humanitarian spending in aid allocation decisions . Second governments can exempt food assistance from trade barriers that impede procurement and delivery . Third donor countries can allow flexibility for implementing agencies by untying food assistance from domestic procurement and shipping restrictions . All of these proposals are regulatory changes that can be made without requiring increased spending . These options are particularly relevant now because donor country governments are entering economic recessions and foreign aid budgets will be constrained .,The COVID 19 pandemic is creating a global food security crisis. Need for international food assistance is rising while supply is being constrained. Donor countries may cut foreign aid budgets during economic recessions. We propose policy responses to keep food assistance flowing without increasing aid budgets. Proposals include prioritizing humanitarian aid spending exempting food assistance from trade barriers and untying aid.
203,The Worldwide Governance Indicators are well known proxies for institutions and are widely used in many studies across different disciplines . Each of the six WGI is constructed by aggregating several baseline indicators that reflect information about a single latent variable . The method used however assumes that the errors associated with the baseline indicators are independent . Here we extend this method by allowing cluster dependence among those errors . The differences between the original and new estimates of the WGI are statistically significant . We compare the results of two highly cited papers with the ones obtained from our method to illustrate that the new indices can alter their conclusions .,We extend the Worldwide Governance Indicators WGI method by incorporating unobservable cluster effects. These effects are statistically significant for the six governance aspects measured by the WGI. We use the extended method to produce a single governance index. The results of two highly cited papers change when our estimates are used in place of the original WGI.
204,Encouraging farmers to adopt pro environmental production is vital to the promotion of sustainable agriculture . Previous observational studies emphasize the importance of economic incentives and information access to farmers decision making processes however due to endogeneity issues little strong causal evidence is available . This study makes an original contribution by experimentally examining the impacts of the 50 price subsidy and information treatments on farmers adoption of organic fertilizer . A short video sharing the experience of farmers who have applied organic fertilizer is selected as our information treatment . We analyze data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with 1287 small scale tea farmers in Vietnam . We find significant impacts of both the information and 50 price subsidy treatments . Moreover the effect of the former is approximately one third that of the latter . Subgroup treatment analysis also reveals that the information treatment performs well for members of certification groups . Thus to induce farmers to adopt pro environmental production behaviors information treatment can partially substitute for subsidies to reduce the burden on the public budget .,We examine the effect of an information treatment via peer farmers and a 50 price subsidy treatment on organic fertilizer adoption. We conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1287 tea cultivating farmers in Vietnam. Both treatments have significant impacts on farmers adoption of organic fertilizer. The information treatment is approximately one third as effective as the subsidy treatment. The information treatment performs well for members of certification groups.
205,This paper investigates the effects of crop biodiversity on farm income and production risk using a large panel dataset of rural households in Kenya . We consider three different metrics of in situ crop diversification . We apply a partial moments based model to test the effects of each strategy on welfare defined as expected crop income variability and downside risk . Our comprehensive econometric approach differentiates climatic shocks weather and climate change . The results suggest that the benefits from greater diversification in terms of enhanced land productivity and lower production costs could surpass the foregone benefit from greater efficiency associated with more concentrated production systems . Crop richness and evenness each reduce exposure to crop income risk especially for more vulnerable farmers who produce below the expected revenue threshold . Farmers who rely on greater crop specialization on the contrary are more exposed to crop income risk .,Past climate shocks strongly influence crop diversification decisions among smallholder farmers in Kenya. Diversification strategies that enhance crop counts per farm richness positively affect crop income. Both crop richness and crop proportional abundance evenness mitigate risk. Greater crop richness and especially crop evenness decrease risk of lower crop income while crop specialization increases income variability. Crop richness and evenness each reduce exposure to risk especially for more vulnerable farmers producing below the expected revenue threshold
206,We examine social equity in a complex community based controlled hunting program in the Bale Mountains Ethiopia . We use a grounded qualitative approach and apply a multi dimensional equity framework to assess locals perceptions of equity in the distribution of benefits and costs the processes of engagement and participation and the recognition of traditional land use practices and values paying attention to the inter and intra community power dynamics institutional characteristics and broader contextual factors that shape perceptions . We conducted interviews with 15 focus groups across four communities and contrast two community based management models one that employs a community power sharing mechanism and one without . In each community we stratified respondents into groups of young men elder men women and community leaders to respect differences in gender age and role in the community . The results demonstrate the interweaving effects that broader contextual factors individual characteristics and institutional support have on equity perceptions . Important contextual dimensions included pre existing and ongoing social political and economic processes such as population growth and land scarcity legacy of land use interactions lack of community infrastructure and youth led political activism and unrest . Individual attributes that influenced perceptions included landlessness and joblessness among the youth the extreme reliance of women on forest products for subsistence and the traditional value systems and practices among elders . Access to information transparency of decision making and the presence of monitoring and accountability also influenced perceived equity . This study contributes to the literature on community based conservation by demonstrating how and why locals concepts of fairness diverge from generic and externally defined notions of equitability . Moving forward equity assessments need to evaluate local actors diverse and contextualized relationships with other actors and the natural world and give recognition to how perceptions interplay with broader social and environmental processes prior to designing and implementing conservation programs .,Population and land pressures shape perceptions of equity toward community based conservation programs in Ethiopia. Women and youth expressed more negative perceptions of distributive and procedural equity compared to elder men and leaders. A new community based conservation model is increasing transparency in decision making and monitoring of resources. In all communities procedural and recognition equity dimensions have not been adequately met.
207,Both basmati rice in India and red rice in Madagascar have gained special export status in their respective countries being more easily allowed to enter global commerce compared to other kinds of rice . Using a chains of meaning framework that centers ethnographic and comparative analysis we examine how basmati and red rice are both made exportable in part through the negotiation of non economic meanings by individuals operating in the in between spaces of trade regulation . We note key differences between basmati and red rice regarding how actors situated along the commodity chain frame and negotiate the export process especially with respect to regulatory scalar and material dimensions . The two case studies illustrate how the paths that seemingly similar specialty commodities pursue through global supply chains are neither linear nor interchangeable but are rather mediated by broader cultural and social relationships . Attention to these relationships can strengthen programs in sustainable trade as they facilitate commodity circulation across spheres of exchange .,Indian basmati and Madagascar red rice are exceptions to national export norms. These exceptions are achieved via different regulatory material and scalar paths. The transformation of meaning may facilitate movement across local global thresholds. Ethnography reveals how meanings are transformed in spaces of trade between production and consumption. Attention to transformations of meaning supports trade development programs.
208,We report on a randomized field experiment designed to relax credit and risk constraints for agricultural activities . We conducted a study in a drought prone region in northern Ethiopia among poor smallholders who depended on rainfed agriculture and were members of the Productive Safety Net Programme . Data were collected from over 1100 farmers in 32 rural villages over two years . We find that unconditional voucher transfers designated for the purchase of agricultural inputs significantly increased usage of seeds and fertilizers raised the amount of farmland used and induced substitution of own effort by hiring casual labor . Subsidized rainfall insurance with reduced input vouchers produced weak average effects but greatly increased investments for farmers who were relatively more patient . We do not find heterogeneous effects by farmers risk attitudes however suggesting that the effects of insurance adoption were mainly determined by how farmers in the safety net made tradeoffs inter temporally . Insurance demand dropped quickly with the reduction in subsidy and did not correlate with time or risk preference . Therefore to improve cost effectiveness insurance programs should include procedures that help identify forward looking farmers and encourage their adoption . While our results show that initial subsidies increase future insurance demand the effect was small and thus initial subsidies would not be a cost effective mechanism for financially sustainable insurance . Other complementary strategies on the design promotion and bundling techniques of insurance would be needed .,Input vouchers increased usage of seeds and fertilizers raised farmland size and induced labor substitution. Subsidized rainfall insurance with reduced input vouchers produced weak effects but greatly increased investments for patient farmers. We do not find heterogeneous effects by farmers risk aversion levels. Insurance demand did not correlate with time or risk preference however and dropped quickly with the reduction in subsidy.

209,The question of diverging interests and preferences within couples over the use of household resources and the consequences of these conflictual views has been present for a long time in the development literature albeit in a somewhat scattered way . This paper selectively reviews the abundant literature that offers insights into the intra household decision making process the strategies put in place by individuals to secure their access to private resources and the role of the changing economic environment in altering these mechanisms . This paper bridges different strands of the social sciences and exemplifies the complementarities among them . The main features of household organization are described to set the scene for the individual strategies introduced to bypass intra household negotiations and secure access to private resources . These strategies include efforts to maintain access to income earning opportunities and secrecy about income and savings . This paper also discusses attempts to maintain or tilt the balance of power within the household through the use of violence on the one hand and marital and fertility choices on the other hand . Finally this paper describes directions for future research aimed at improving the understanding of household behaviour and responses to economic stimuli .,Social sciences give insights into the intra household decision making process and the individual strategies to secure access to resources. Social norms regulate gender roles and make it difficult for women to access resources often leading to allocative inefficiencies. Secretly securing resources permits to circumvent intra household conflicts and seize economic opportunities. Change in the economic environment might generate friction with prevailing norms and prompt collective resistance if it affects bargaining power. Violence marital and fertility choices are used dynamically to maintain or tilt the balance of power within the household.

322,The present study aimed to illuminate the mechanism of textural deterioration of MP gels induced by high temperature treatments . Measurements of textural properties showed that the decreased thermal stability is responsible for the gel texture . Analysis of the microstructure of MP gel showed that the over aggregation of MP was strictly related to the gel quality loss . Further investigations on protein structures indicated that the proteins tended to be more stretched in higher temperature treatments leading to an increase in disulfide bonds and a reduction in the noncovalent interactions promoting the over aggregation of protein . To conclude high temperature induced textural deterioration of MP gel was initialized by the dramatic changes of protein structures during heat treatment which decreased thermal stability of MP gels due to the over aggregation of MP molecules . Once the altered thermal stability was insufficient to resist the over heating such deterioration would occur .,The MP gels at different temperature showed different textural properties. The larger protein aggregates could harm the textural properties of MP gels. The smaller and less heterogeneous of protein aggregate were favorable to MP gels. The thermal stability of protein was closely related to the textural properties.

In this experiment communication through face to face encounters mobile instant messaging and combinations thereof were executed based on qualitative and quantitative data . Our research results describe the differences between experimental treatments . Various relevant teaching implications are discussed as well .,Cooperative simulation is enabled by social interaction. This study examines student s experience in cooperative simulation interactions. Participants advocated for face to face interaction.
454,The use of online social media is part of daily life but may impact subjective well being negatively and contribute to the development of addictive tendencies . The present empirical study investigated the mechanisms that might explain this development . An online survey and an implicit association test investigated the relationship between implicit associations with SM SM flow and addictive social media use in a sample of 145 users of SM . The results reveal a significant positive association between all three investigated constructs . Moreover SM flow mediated the relationship between the implicit associations and addictive SMU significantly . Implicit associations with SM might therefore foster immersion into the online world which contributes to SM flow s positive experience . However SM flow might also serve as an antecedent of addictive tendencies . The study findings should be considered when assessing individuals at risk of addictive SMU and when developing intervention programs to deal with problematic social platform use .,Implicit associations with social media SM are positively linked to SM flow. Implicit associations with SM are positively linked with addictive SM use SMU . SM flow mediates the link between implicit associations and addictive SMU.
455,Social media such as Facebook and Instagram are daily used by many people . The current study investigated the reasons for social media use as well as their relationships with daily stress depression and anxiety symptoms experience of flow during the usage process and tendencies of addictive SMU . In a sample of 485 users of different social platforms age,Reasons for social media SM use may be assigned to five main categories. SM flow positively predicts the search for positive emotions on SM. SM flow positively predicts the escape from negative emotions on SM. Depression symptoms negatively predict the search for positive emotions on SM. Use of SM to escape from negative emotions positively predicts addictive tendencies.
456,Individuals who engage in sexting are primarily motivated by the desire to initiate sex with their sexting partner . The bulk of the research into sexting however focuses on potential negative consequences or societal concerns about participating in the behavior . The current study took a mixed methods approach to assessing the feelings that adults experience when sending and or receiving sext messages . A total of 405 participants who identified as participating in sexting behaviors with their relationship partner in the past 12 months responded to open ended prompts that explored their feelings when sending or receiving a sext message from their partner . Qualitative text coding identified eight themes . Excitement was mentioned most frequently typically in conjunction with other feelings with over one third of respondents who mentioned feeling anxious naughty good or wanted also mentioning feeling excited . Quantitative text analyses revealed that people who were more attracted to the same sex wrote more about sexting using more explicit and complex language with higher rates of biological words e.g .,Most participants mentioned feeling excited when sexting their partner. Those attracted to the same gender used more sexual language. The feeling of excitement was often coupled with another feeling. Sexting is a complex arousing and often positive experience.
457,Service robots are on the rise . Technological advances in engineering artificial intelligence and machine learning enable robots to take over tasks traditionally carried out by humans . Despite the rapid increase in the employment of robots there are still frequent failures in the performance of service robots . This research examines how and to what extent people attribute responsibility toward service robots in such cases of service failures compared to when humans provide the same service failures . Participants were randomly assigned to read vignettes describing a service failure either by a service robot or a human and were then asked who they thought was responsible for the service failure . The results of three experiments show that people attributed less responsibility toward a robot than a human for the service failure because people perceive robots to have less controllability over the task . However people attributed more responsibility toward a,When service fails people attribute less responsibility toward a service provider if it is a robot rather than a human. People perceive a robot service provider to have less control over a service outcome than a human service provider. People attribute more blame toward a service firm when a robot delivers a failed service than when a human does.
458,Adults with cerebral palsy may experience problems with participation in domestic life and interpersonal relationships . To identify teenage predictors of adult participation in domestic life and interpersonal relationships . This 13 year follow up of the PERRIN 16 24 cohort included 53 adults with CP without intellectual disability years . Participation performance was assessed as attendance and difficulty assistance with participation . 56 teenage factors were categorized in ICF components . Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses explored predictors of participation . Lower gross motor capacity following special education having protective parents and a rigid personality predicted less participation in domestic life . Having rejective parents receiving little daily support having a socially avoidant personality or coping style and the male gender predicted less participation in interpersonal relationships . Lower activity and participation levels as a teenager predicted less participation in both domestic life and interpersonal relationships of adults with CP . Environmental and personal factors gross motor capacity and teenage participation were predictors of participation of adults with CP . These factors help identify subgroups at risk for suboptimal adult participation and provide targets for rehabilitation .,In individuals with cerebral palsy. Parenting style and personality predict adult participation. Teenage gross motor capacity predicts adult participation in domestic life. Teenage coping predicts adult participation in interpersonal relationships.
459,Research conducted with typically developing infants and children generally indicates that better habitual sleep and sleep after learning are related to enhanced memory . Less is known however about associations between sleep and recall memory in children with Down syndrome . The present study was conducted to determine whether parent reported sleep problems were differentially associated with encoding 1 month delayed recall memory and forgetting over time in children with DS and those who were TD . Ten children with DS and 10 TD children participated in a two session study . At each session recall memory was assessed using an elicited imitation paradigm . Immediate imitation was permitted at the first session as an index of encoding and delayed recall was assessed 1 month later . In addition parents provided demographic information and reported on child sleep problems . Although parents did not report more frequent sleep problems for children with DS relative to TD children regression based moderation analyses revealed that more frequent sleep problems were associated with increased forgetting of individual target actions and their order by children with DS . Evidence of moderation was not found when examining encoding or delayed recall . Although group differences were not found when considering parent reported sleep problems more frequent sleep problems were positively associated with increased forgetting by children with DS relative to those who were TD . Although future experimental work is needed to determine causality these results suggest that improved sleep in children with DS might reduce forgetting ultimately improving long term recall memory .,Parent reported sleep problems did not differ for children with Down syndrome and their typically developing peers. Sleep problems moderated the effect of group on the forgetting of individual target actions and their order. For children with Down syndrome increased forgetting was associated with greater parent reported sleep problems.
460,Little is known about the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy . This systematic review aimed to examine the extent to which methodological best practices have been applied to achieve valid and informative QoL assessments for this population . Systematic search identified 1097 non duplicated quantitative articles assessing self and or proxy reported QoL in samples of adults with CP . Eighteen studies were included and data extraction was conducted for sampling characteristics selection of informants adequacy of administered measures and examination of age related specificities . The results revealed discrepancies between conceptual definitions of QoL and their measurement approaches in CP . Most papers relied on self reports . Most studies were cross sectional and often based on relatively small samples the variable of age was considered inconsistently in statistical analyses . Future strategies to improve the validity and applicability of QoL assessments of adults with CP would include using a clear definition of QoL aligned with the measurement employed considering proxy reports whenever appropriate to encompass larger samples and a wider range of ability and using age stratified analyses in order to deepen understanding of potentially modifiable variables and paths linked to QoL outcomes .,QoL outcomes tend to decline when people with CP enter adulthood. Age related specificities ensure the developmental validity of QoL assessments. Proxy reports are preferred for QoL assessment in the most severely impaired cases. Modifiable mechanisms and pathways linked to QoL remain understudied for CP. A family perspective is likely to improve QoL assessments across the lifespan.
461,There is evidence that siblings of children with a developmental disability experience poorer mental health outcomes and increased stress compared to siblings of non disabled children . The variables which contribute to this are unclear . This study was designed to examine population level and individual variables associated with differences in mental health outcomes among siblings of children who have a variety of developmental disabilities . Population level administrative health data covering 19852014 for the province of British Columbia Canada were used to develop a cohort of over 45 000 children who have a sibling with a DD . Individual level demographic and health care services variables were used in logistic regression to assess their relationship to diagnoses of depression or other mental health problems . Odds of a diagnosis of depression or a mental health problem other than depression were associated with sex of the non disabled sibling sex of the child with the developmental disability type of disability birth order and income . Type of developmental disability and characteristics of the non disabled sibling and their family are associated with mental health outcomes of siblings of children with a DD .,Mental health outcomes of non disabled siblings of children who have a developmental disbility was associated with the sex of the non disabled sibling sex of the sibling with the developmental disability income birth order and type of disability. Sisters had increased odds of depression compared to brothers. There was no difference between sisters and brothers in odds of a mental health problem other than depression . Siblings with a very low income were associated with increased odds of depression or another mental health problem compared to siblings with higher incomes. Siblings of children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Autism Spectrum Disorder and Other types of developmental disability were associated with higher odds of a mental health problem when compared to siblings of children who have Down syndrome. The greatest effect was found for siblings of children with FAS.
462,Autistic children often recall fewer details about witnessed events than typically developing children although the information they recall is generally no less accurate . Previous research has not examined the narrative coherence of such accounts despite higher quality narratives potentially being perceived more favourably by criminal justice professionals and juries . This study compared the narrative coherence of witness transcripts produced by autistic and typically developing children . Secondary analysis was carried out on interview transcripts from a subset of 104 participants who had taken part in a larger study of eyewitness skills in autistic and TD children . Groups were matched on chronological age IQ and receptive language ability . Coding frameworks were adopted from existing narrative research featuring elements of story grammar . Whilst fewer event details were reported by autistic children there were no group differences in narrative coherence narrative length or semantic diversity . These findings suggest that the narrative coherence of autistic childrens witness accounts is equivalent to TD peers of comparable age and ability .,Autistic child witnesses recall fewer correct details than non autistic children. However the narrative coherence of their accounts does not differ. There are no group differences in account length or semantic diversity either. Autistic child witnesses produce well formed narratives.
463,Whilst there is a growing body of research on the psychological outcomes for siblings of autistic children few studies have considered the school context . To explore group differences on two school related self reported outcomes for autism siblings and siblings of non autistic children sense of school belonging and academic self concept . Data on self and parent carer reported behavioural and emotional problems were also collected . 65 autism siblings and a comparison group of 57 siblings of non autistic children aged 1116 years completed questionnaires measuring sense of school belonging academic self concept and behaviour problems . 73 parents in the autism sibling and 67 parents in the comparison sibling group completed the behaviour problems measure . Autism siblings reported significantly lower school belonging and academic self concept and had significantly poorer self and parent reported behaviour problems . When controlling for demographic variables and internalising and externalizing behaviour robust sibling group differences on academic variables remained . Autism siblings reported poorer school related outcomes and increased behavioural difficulties relative to siblings of non autistic children . There was wide variation in autism siblings outcomes highlighting the importance of taking an individualised and contextualised approach to understanding the varying needs of autism siblings .,The school context has often been omitted from research in sibling groups. Academic self concept and school belonging are key factors in understanding school experience. Siblings of autistic children reported poorer academic self concept and sense of school belonging. Group differences remained when controlling for potential confounding variables. We report large variability in sibling outcomes highlighting the importance of differentiation.
464,Both siblings and parents are important interactional partners for children with ASD but we know little about whether these interactions differ between these two groups or between older and younger siblings . To gather data about how parents perceive the interactional behaviors displayed by their child with ASD in play with their typically developing siblings and their parents . Parents completed a questionnaire developed for this study about the behaviors their children with ASD demonstrated when interacting with a sibling or parent . Following factor analysis a 29 item instrument with two factors was revealed . Factors were labelled Prosocial Interaction and Withdrawal Agonism . In some families children with ASD were reported to display significantly higher levels of negative interaction when playing with their older siblings in comparison to younger siblings . When playing with their children with ASD parents reported significantly more negative interactions compared to when their children with ASD played with younger siblings . There were few differences reported for play behaviors with parents versus older siblings . Children with ASD appear to display different interactional behaviors depending upon their play partners within the family unit . This study could be used to inform researchers of different interaction strategies which may be useful in creating interventions .,Development of the Sibling and Parent Play Interactions SAPPI instrument. In some families children with ASD were reported to engage in more withdrawal agonism with older versus younger siblings. Children with ASD were reported to engage in significantly more withdrawal agonism in play with parents than with younger siblings. Few reported differences in behaviors of children with ASD when playing with older siblings and parents.
465,The current study examined the relationships of typically developing children with siblings with and without intellectual disabilities as expressed in TD children s drawings and questionnaires answered by TD children and their mothers . It also examined group differences in the sibling relationships as well as the associations between having a sibling with or without ID and sibling relationships and TD children s social emotional adjustment . Participants were mothers and their TD children . Some had ID siblings ID others had TD siblings . Sibling relationships were examined via mothers and target children s completion of questionnaires and objective visual indicators and observed content based indicators of children s drawings were assessed following the art based phenomenological analytic approach . Mothers reported on children s social emotional adjustment . Findings indicated differences in sibling relationships including higher levels of positive relationships for children with ID siblings . Children s drawings also showed positive relationship aspects for these children . Sibling relationship qualities were significantly associated with children s adjustment . Children s drawings may be a useful data gathering tool to deepen our understanding of unique aspects of sibling relationships .,The present study examined sibling relationships among typically developing TD children and their siblings both TD siblings and those with intellectual disabilities ID . Sibling relationships were examined via mothers and children s self reports In addition children were asked to draw themselves and their siblings. Drawings were assessed using both objective and inductive indicators. Children s drawings are a useful tool for further understanding of sibling relationships. Findings underscore the importance of sibling relationships in childrens social emotional functioning.
466,Most siblings of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities report positive sibling relationships . However extant research often only examines the perspective of the nondisabled sibling it is unclear whether siblings with IDD report close sibling relationships . Thus the aim of this study was to understand adult sibling relationships from the perspectives of both siblings with and without IDD . Using dyadic interviews we examined the perspectives of eight adult sibling dyads . The study was conducted in the United States . Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis and cross case analysis to identify themes within and across dyads . Overall siblings with and without IDD reported enjoying spending time with one another . However siblings with and without Down syndrome reported more reciprocal sibling relationships more frequent contact and a greater range of shared activities . Implications for future research and practice are discussed .,Individuals with IDD and their siblings described having positive relationships. Individuals with IDD and their siblings enjoyed spending time together. Both siblings agreed about their perceptions of the context and quality of their sibling relationship. Individuals with Down syndrome and their siblings reported more reciprocal relationships. Individuals with Down syndrome and their siblings engaged in a wider variety of social activities.
467,Culturally sensitive care is essential for improving healthcare for ethnic minorities with intellectual disabilities who require intensive sometimes lifelong care and support . The present study aimed to uncover factors that may complicate the delivery of culturally sensitive care for ethnic minorities with ID which have not previously been studied for this group . By means of in depth interviews with care professionals we identified these factors at the care receiver professional and institutional levels . Eight factors were found to complicate the delivery of culturally sensitive care abilities of the individuals with ID communication with the family of the care receiver cultural competency of the professional personal attitude and experience of the professional job position and responsibilities of the professional resources legislation and protocols and the team of colleagues . The factors at the care receiver level were specific for the delivery of culturally sensitive care to individuals with ID . In addition to the complicating factors previously identified for other forms of culturally sensitive healthcare we identified novel complicating factors for the care of individuals with ID . Future research should investigate how these complicating factors could be overcome .,Ethnic minorities with intellectual disabilities require culturally sensitive care. Eight factors complicate the delivery of culturally sensitive care. Identifying cultural needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities is complex. Communication issues with the parents of care receivers have various causes. Collaboration and communication between all levels of care organisations are vital.
468,Research suggests that autistic individuals may be more likely to come into contact with police and have more negative experiences in police custody . However limited information about the difficulties they experience during the custody process is available . This study explores the experiences of autistic individuals and officers during a walkthrough of the custody process to identify specific difficulties in these encounters and what support is needed to overcome these . A participative walkthrough method was developed to provide autistic individuals and officers an interactive opportunity to identify areas where further support in the custody process was needed . Two autistic participants and three officers took part in the study . Autistic participants reported negative experiences due to i the emotional impact of the physical setting and custody process ii communication barriers leading to increased anxiety and iii exposure to sensory demands . Officers highlighted three factors which limit their ability to support autistic individuals effectively i the custody context ii barriers to communication and iii knowledge and understanding of autism . Adjustments are needed to the custody process and environment to support interactions between autistic individuals and officers and improve the overall wellbeing of autistic individuals .,Autistic individuals prevented from effectively participating in custody process. Barriers to communication affect interactions between officers and autistic detainees. The custody environment creates sensory difficulties for autistic detainees. Officers are prevented from providing effective support due to demands of custody. Changes to practice the custody environment and policy will help improve support.
469,When detected children with asymmetrical motor impairment are referred for therapeutic interventions to maximize the child s ability to reach their health and developmental potential . Referal is dependent on standardized evaluation which rarely examines upper extremity function within the context of real world activity . Accelerometry provides an efficient method to objectively measure movement in children . The purpose of this study was to compare accelerometry to clinical assessment specifically the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function 2 . A total of 52 children between 117 years of age with asymmetrical motor deficits and age matched controls participated in this study . Participants wore bilateral accelerometers for 4 x 25 h. The use ratio and mono arm use index were calculated to quantify asymmetrical impairment . The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function 2 was administered and compared to accelerometry variables . The UR and MAUI were significantly different in children with and without deficits . The MAUI was significantly correlated with all domains of the MA 2 accuracy fluency dexterity and range of motion . Our findings suggest a relationship between real world movement and clinical evaluation .,Accelerometry can be used to measure real world motor behavior in children. Moderate concurrent reliability between accelerometry and the Melbourne Assessment 2. A combination of clinical assessment and wearable technology can be used to describe movement.
470,Despite increased understandings that the whole family system is influenced by a family member being diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Condition the experiences of siblings can be overlooked . However recently understanding of siblings experiences has begun to develop via qualitative studies . This review aimed to systematically identify appraise and review the qualitative literature investigating the lived experience of siblings of autistic people . Six databases were systematically searched for studies reporting empirical qualitative data on the lived experience of neurotypical siblings of autistic people . Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria and were analysed using Thematic Synthesis . Data synthesis revealed four superordinate themes A narrative of love and empathy was present throughout . However several participants also experienced significant difficulties affecting their mental health . Findings suggest a sense of agency understanding ASC time spent alone with parents supportive environments and the chance to relate to other siblings as protective factors in facilitating positive psychological wellbeing for siblings of autistic people .,Siblings experienced empathy and affection towards their autistic siblings. Siblings felt that their own needs were often overlooked negatively affecting their wellbeing. Siblings reported undertaking caring roles which were different to those typically expected. Some experienced fear and anxiety associated with their autistic siblings challenging behaviours.
471,Sleep problems are prevalent among young children with autism spectrum disorders . The Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire is commonly used for assessment but there are outstanding questions regarding its optimal measurement model . To examine the factor structure of the CSHQ in preschool children with ASD and relationships between CSHQ factors and childrens emotional cognitive and behavioral dysregulation . Participants included 4 to 5 year olds with ASD . Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine whether two previously reported CSHQ factor structures provided adequate fit to the sample data . Exploratory Factor Analysis was used examine alternative models . Regression analyses were used to examine how CSHQ factor scores explained variance in dysregulation symptoms measured by the Child Behavior Checklist . Previously reported factor models in children with ASD were not confirmed but a novel five factor model identified using EFA provided excellent fit to the sample data . Sleep factors were generally not correlated with autism symptoms but were associated with aggression anxiety depression and attention problems with evidence of specificity in these relationships . The proposed CSHQ five factor model may be useful in future studies of sleep problems in young children with ASD .,Sleep problems are prevalent among young children with autism spectrum disorders ASD . A five factor model of the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire CSHQ among preschool children with ASD best fitted the data from the current study. There are distinctive relationships between specific types of sleep problems and childrens emotional and behavioral dysregulation. A narrower age range in this sample may provide clarity regarding CSHQ measurement model and relationships with behavioral dysregulation.
472,This cross syndrome study focuses on sleep and its relationship with language development . Children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with language delay . Typical language development is constrained by numerous factors including sleep . Sleep is often disrupted in adolescents adults with neurodevelopmental disorders . We therefore hypothesised that sleep may be disrupted and correlate with language development in infants toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders . To test our hypothesis we obtained sleep and vocabulary size data from 75 infants toddlers with one of three neurodevelopmental disorders fragile X syndrome Williams syndrome . Sleep was indeed disrupted in these children . It was also positively associated with receptive vocabulary size in the infants toddlers with DS and WS . We argue that disrupted sleep may be a common occurrence in very young children with neurodevelopmental disorders and it may relate to their ability to acquire their first language .,Sleep is disrupted in infants and toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders. Sleep is related to language ability in infants toddlers with Down syndrome and Williams syndrome. Sleep may therefore play a role in the emergence of the Down Williams syndrome phenotype.
473,An international focus on the inclusion of students with disabilities in mainstream schools and the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder has contributed to increasing numbers of students with ASD enrolling in mainstream schools . The school participation restrictions of adolescent students with ASD is widely researched but less is known about the challenges faced by primary school students with ASD and how early in their schooling these challenges arise . Focus groups were used to explore the perspectives of parents and educators on the school participation of primary school students with ASD . Focus group data were analysed thematically . Four themes were derived from the data more than just being there meeting in the middle consistency of supports and embrace difference . Findings from this study highlight that students aged between 6 and 11 years experience school participation restrictions due to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors . It is imperative school based interventions are developed and implemented in the early primary years that not only target students skills but the range of environmental enablers and barriers impacting student school participation .,Students with ASD experience barriers to their participation in mainstream schools. School culture and belonging are factors that lead to participation restrictions. Conflicting stakeholder expectations impact efforts to support participation. Failure to embrace difference impacts. students with diverse learning needs. Interventions to improve participation and belonging are vital in primary years.
474,Previous research results suggest that ADHD symptoms explain the relationship between specific learning disability and externalising psychopathology and between math disability and anxiety but not between reading disability and anxiety . For depression previous results are mixed . The current study aims to clarify this role of ADHD symptoms in the relationship between various areas of academic achievement and psychopathological symptoms . We used linear regressions based on data from a general population sample collected using online assessment of 3 ADHD symptoms completely account for the relationship between reading writing achievement and anxiety and between writing math achievement and conduct problems . The negative relationship between academic achievement and depression was strongest for children with average or high ADHD symptom scores . ADHD symptoms play an important role in explaining the relationship between academic achievement and psychopathological symptoms in elementary school children . The nature and size of this role depend on the exact constructs under study . We discuss implications for the support of children with learning problems ADHD and or psychopathological problems .,ADHD symptoms confound the link between academic achievement and psychopathology. The degree of confounding depends on the area of achievement psychopathology. ADHD symptoms moderate the relationship between academic achievement and depression.
475,The aim of the review was to synthesise the literature on the types and effectiveness of interventions to improve sleep for individuals with Angelman Syndrome . Four databases were searched using predetermined search terms . Data extraction was performed on studies to examine participant characteristics study design intervention procedures intervention duration dependent variables . Intervention outcomes were categorised as positive negative or and certainty of evidence as a measure of quality was reported for each study . Ten studies including 54 participants with AS met the inclusion criteria . Included studies comprised of both single subject designs and group based designs . Pharmacological interventions were the most commonly used followed by combined pharmacological and behavioral treatment or behavioral interventions as a single intervention . Pharmacological interventions demonstrated both positive and mixed outcomes and were categorised at a suggestive level of evidence . Behavioral interventions as a sole intervention and as a combined intervention were found to have positive outcomes and was also categorised at a suggestive level of evidence . This review found provisional evidence but weak evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and mixed outcomes for the effectiveness of Melatonin for the treatment of sleep problems in AS . All 10 studies only achieved a suggestive level of certainty therefore further high quality research is needed to evaluate interventions for the treatment of sleep problems in this population .,Behavioral interventions preliminary effectiveness at reducing sleep problems. Pharmacological interventions reveal varied outcomes of success for sleep problems. Combined pharmacological and behavioral intervention to treat sleep problems.
476,Sleep problems are common in Smith Magenis and Angelman syndromes . Effectiveness of interventions depends on appropriate assessment complicated by compromised self report and health and behaviour difficulties . Studying settling and waking in these syndromes could inform assessment . To describe settling and waking behaviours in children at high risk of sleep and health problems using direct observation . Video and actigraphy data were collected for 12 participants with AS and challenging behaviours were rare at settling and waking in both groups . In the AS group pain related behaviours were more likely to occur before waking than by chance . Findings highlight the importance of considering pain as a cause of sleep problems in AS . The principle and methodology could be extended to individuals with ID experiencing sleep problems .,Children with Angelman syndrome show pain related behaviours as they settle to sleep. Children with Angelman syndrome may wake due to pain or discomfort. Children with Smith Magenis syndrome may be in pain as they settle to sleep. Ruling out pain is critical before trialling behavioural sleep interventions.
477,Thus far very little research has focused on siblings in early adolescent years growing up with an autistic sibling . Adopting a community based participatory research approach 11 typically developing sisters actively collaborated in the study to collect and analyse data as well as disseminate their experiences needs and perspectives in their local communities . This is the first study to use a modified Photovoice methodology which provided typically developing sisters an active participatory role . The results highlighted the feelings needs and thoughts the sisters expressed in their role as siblings friends but also as students and citizens with a passion for advocacy and limited support in the community due to unhelpful attitudes of members of their community towards autism .,There is a growing number of research examining siblings experiences where one siblings is autistic. Most of this research has used word alone interviews to examine the impact of autism in the family. The methods applied in the current study may be of considerable significance for the formative stages of further research in family disability studies. The findings of the current study point to several positive experiences and opportunities for wellbeing especially during siblings shared time activities. This message is important for parents siblings and autistic people themselves. This study may help researchers and professionals enhance their understanding of family experiences in families raising an autistic child with additional learning disabilities beyond a deficit perspective. Sisters identify their perceived needs and struggles in their life noting that these often are the result of parental and societal reactions to their autistic siblings.
478,People with an intellectual disability are vulnerable to communication impairments with consequences for employment education and social participation . To identify the communication skills of a population of adults with ID and explore relationships between individual and environmental factors and communication skills . Data from a sample of 601 adults with ID was selected from the Intellectual Disability Supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing addressing communication characteristics demographics co morbidities challenging behaviours and social participation . A multiple regression model and a decision making tree were built to identify factors related to communication abilities . Overall 57.9 of participants experienced communication difficulties with 23.5 reporting severe difficulties . Only 75.1 of participants communicated verbally more than half found communicating with professionals and non familiar partners difficult . Level of ID low social participation challenging behaviours and diagnosis of Down syndrome were significantly associated with communication difficulties . Communication difficulties are prevalent in adults with ID and are influenced by complex factors . Interventions to enhance interaction and quality of life of individuals with ID should consider communication opportunities needs and barriers .,Over 57 of a population sample of adults with ID reported communication difficulties. Difficulties were described as severe in almost a quarter of the sample 23.5 . Level of ID residential setting and social participation were significant factors. Challenging behaviours and a diagnosis of Down syndrome were also important risk factors for communication difficulties.
479,Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is able to detect localize and quantify subtle brain white matter abnormalities that may not be visible on conventional structural MRI . Over the past years a growing number of studies have applied dMRI to investigate structure function relationships in children with cerebral palsy . To provide an overview of the recent literature on dMRI and motor function in children with CP . A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed Embase Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials Cinahl and Web of Science from 2012 onwards . In total 577 children with CP in 19 studies were included . Sixteen studies only included unilateral CP while none included dyskinetic CP . Most studies focused on specific regions tracts of interest versus two studies that investigated the whole brain . In unilateral and bilateral CP white matter abnormalities were widespread including non motor areas . In unilateral CP consistent relationships were found between white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract and somatosensory pathways with upper limb sensorimotor function . The role of commissural and associative tracts remains poorly investigated . Also results describing structure function relationships in bilateral CP are scarce . This review underlines the importance of both the motor and somatosensory tracts for upper limb sensorimotor function in unilateral CP . However the exact contribution of each tract requires further exploration . In addition research on the relevance of non motor pathways is warranted as well as studies including other types of CP .,In unilateral and bilateral CP white matter microstructural abnormalities are widespread including non motor areas. In unilateral CP dMRI reveals a relationship between the microstructural properties of motor and somatosensory tracts and upper limb sensorimotor function. The contribution of motor versus somatosensory tracts needs further clarification. There are limited studies in bilateral spastic CP and in children with dyskinetic CP.
480,The internal modelling deficit hypothesis suggests that motor control issues associated with Developmental Coordination Disorder are the result of impaired predictive motor control . In this study we examined the benefits of a combined action observation and motor imagery intervention designed to alleviate deficits in internal modelling and improve eye hand coordination during a visuomotor rotation task . Twenty children with DCD were randomly assigned to either an AO MI group or a control group . Each group then attempted to learn a 90 visuomotor rotation while measurements of completion time eye movement behaviour and movement kinematics were recorded . As predicted after training the AO MI group exhibited quicker completion times more target focused eye movement behaviour and smoother movement kinematics compared to the control group . No significant after effects were present . These results offer further support for the IMD hypothesis and suggest that AO MI interventions may help to alleviate such deficits and improve motor performance in children with DCD .,Combined action observation and motor imagery facilitates visuomotor adaptation. Updating of the internal forward model can be advanced by an AO MI intervention. Internal modelling deficits in children with DCD are reflected in their eye movements. AO MI intervention improved eye hand coordination and movement kinematics. AO MI has potential as an intervention technique for use with children with DCD.
481,Parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder use several coping strategies to deal with ADHD symptoms impacting family life . The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the coping strategies used by parents of children with ADHD identify which tools are most frequently used to measure coping strategies and examine factors influencing parental coping . According to PRISMA guidelines we searched for articles indexed in PubMed EBSCOhost Scopus and Web of Science using a combination of expressions including coping AND ADHD OR attention deficit hyperactivity disorder AND parent OR parenting OR caregiver . Fourteen empirical studies were identified as relevant to our research . Many different types of tools are used to assess coping strategies . We found that parents of ADHD children used more avoidant focused coping strategies than parents of typical children . Mothers of ADHD children sought significantly more support and used more indirect means than mothers of typically developing children . This review underlines the importance of further exploring coping mechanisms of parents of children with ADHD in order to promote positive coping strategies for parents of children with ADHD and to help such parents to identify people who can support them .,Parents of ADHD children used more dysfunctional coping styles than those of TD. The most commonly used strategy by parents of children with ADHD seems to be avoidant focused coping. Mothers of ADHD children sought more support than mothers of TD children. Review illustrates the need to adapt psychoeducational interventions for parents of ADHD children.
482,Students with intellectual disabilities are at increased risk of peer victimization and depressive symptoms . Little is known about the protective and aggravating factors that influence the association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms among students with ID . This study assesses the moderating role of two facets of teacher student relationships warmth and conflicton the association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms . A sample of 395 students with mild and moderate ID was recruited in Canada and Australia . Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that victimization and TSR conflict were both associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and that TSR conflict moderated the associations between both TSR warmth and victimization and depressive symptoms . TSR warmth was related to lower levels of depression only for students who also reported a low level of TSR conflict . Similarly associations between victimization and depression were weaker among students exposed to more conflictual TSR . Students with ID are at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms when exposed to negative social relationships . For these students the benefits of TSR warmth were far less important than the consequences of conflict .,Peer victimization was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Conflict with teachers was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Closeness with teachers led to lower depression in the absence of conflict. Conflict with teachers reduced the link between victimization and depression.
483,Sleep problems particularly insomnia are highly prevalent in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and can negatively affect health and development . eHealth interventions may increase access to evidence based care for insomnia for children with NDD as programs are rare in most communities . The present study examined whether parents of children with NDD perceived the original BNBD to be usable acceptable and feasible and what modifications might be necessary to adapt it for children with NDD . Twenty Canadian parents caregivers of children aged 410 years with NDD and insomnia implemented the BNBD intervention with their children and completed usability questionnaires . Questionnaire data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively . Participants reported the intervention to be usable useful acceptable and feasible . Several modifications were suggested to make the intervention more appropriate and acceptable for use with children with NDD . Results support a largely transdiagnostic approach to treating sleep in children with NDD and will inform the development of BNBD for Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders .,Insomnia treatment is needed for children with neurodevelopmental disorders NDD . BNBD is an eHealth program for typically developing children. Parents of children with NDD reported BNBD was usable feasible and acceptable. Parents main recommendation was to add some diagnosis specific information and strategies. Results largely support a modular transdiagnostic approach to insomnia treatment.
484,Down syndrome is associated with poor sleep but little is known about its neural correlates . The current research compared brain morphometry in youth with Down syndrome with parent reported sleep problems to peers with Down syndrome and typical development without parent reported sleep problems matched on age and sex ratio . Magnetic resonance imaging was completed on a 3 T scanner . Participants were stratified into groups based on parent report DS S DS TD . Brain morphometry processed with the FreeSurfer Image Analysis Suite was compared across groups . In addition the co occurrence of medical conditions in the DS groups was examined . Youth with DS S had reduced total frontal parietal and temporal brain volumes relative to DS and TD peers . They also had higher rates of congenital heart defects than the DS only group however this comorbidity did not appear to account for morphometry differences . Parent reported sleep problems in DS appear to relate to global and localized volume reductions . These preliminary results have implications for understanding the neural correlates of poor sleep in DS they also highlight the importance of examining relations between sleep and other medical comorbidities .,Little is known about the brain in youth with Down syndrome and poor sleep DS S . The current study examined brain morphometry in youth with DS S. The DS S group had smaller total brain volume than youth with DS only. Specific reductions were noted in several frontal parietal and temporal gyri. More research is needed to further characterize the brain in youth with DS S.
485,Self concept is a critical psychosocial outcome in childhood that is shaped by many factors . Gender motor coordination and age have been identified as three important contributors . The present study examined whether poor motor coordination gender and age have a synergistic effect on domains of self concept and self worth in children . Data were derived from the Physical Health and Activity Study Team longitudinal open cohort project . Children enrolled in grade 4 A significant 3 way interaction between rDCD gender and age was observed for athletic ability physical appearance and academic competence but not social competence behavioural conduct or global self worth . Findings revealed developmental trajectories for self perceptions of athletic ability physical appearance and academic competence were lowest among rDCD girls . Boys classified as rDCD also demonstrated lower athletic academic and physical self perceptions in comparison to typically developing children . Age intensifies disparities in self held athletic physical and academic perceptions attributable to differences in gender and rDCD status however differences in these domains appear to be independent of childrens overall views of themselves .,A 3 way interaction between rDCD gender and age on athletic physical and academic self perceptions was observed. Athletic physical and social self perceptions were lowest and declined most among rDCD girls. rDCD boys also showed lower athletic physical and academic self perceptions. Self perceptions were generally stable among typically developing children. Differences in sub domains of self perceptions appear to independent of global self worth.
486,Caregivers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders have elevated levels of stress which can negatively impact family functioning and caregivers mental and physical health . Self care is a critical resource to address caregivers stress . This study describes strategies and obstacles related to self care reported by caregivers of children with FASD . It also examines how caregivers perceived confidence in and frequency of self care is related to stress parenting attitudes and family needs . Forty six caregivers of children with FASD identified self care strategies and obstacles and rated their confidence and frequency of self care . Additional measures of perceived parenting efficacy stress family needs child behavior and family demographics were administered . Correlation analyses examined associations between self care and measures of child and family functioning . Self care strategies and obstacles were varied . Greater reported confidence in self care was associated with less parental distress and more satisfaction in the parenting role . Frequency of self care was positively associated with confidence in self care but not with any other measure of family functioning . Caregivers use a variety of strategies and face significant obstacles in self care . Confidence in self care may be associated with lower stress and greater satisfaction in the parenting role .,Caregivers of children with FASD reported varied self care strategies. Self care confidence related to parenting satisfaction distress and needs met. Self care frequency related to perceived confidence but not other outcomes. Limited time resources and social support were common obstacles to self care.
487,While parents of children with developmental disabilities show greater parenting burden and distress compared with their counterparts little is known about to what extent developmental polymorbidity in children escalates and magnifies the risk of parental distress . This study investigated the co occurrence of developmental disabilities among a sample of elementary school children and examined its additive effects on child psychosocial functioning and parental distress . A cross sectional survey among 710 parents of elementary school children in Hong Kong included measures of child psychosocial functioning and parental stress . Structural equation modeling was used to test a hypothesized model in which child psychosocial functioning mediates the effect of developmental polymorbidity on parental distress . About one fourth of the participants reported their children having two or more developmental disabilities . The number of developmental disabilities was positively related to the severity of emotional and behavioral problems in children which in turn explained general and parenting distress in parents . Given the heightened vulnerability to distress among parents of children with multiple developmental disabilities psychological care should particularly target this population . Early identification and intervention strategies are also needed to detect children with multiple co occurring developmental disabilities which could potentially alleviate their emotional and behavioral problems and lessen the parenting burden .,Developmental polymorbidity was observed in one fourth of the respondents. The number of developmental disabilities was related to greater distress in parents. Psychosocial functioning explained the effect of developmental polymorbidity. Universal developmental screening and subsequent family centered support are essential.
488,Cerebral Visual Impairment is very common yet often unrecognised visual dysfunction in children with Cerebral Palsy . Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the diagnostic tool in the investigation of brain lesions in children with CP and CVI . The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the relationship between brain structure and CVI as determined by MRI in children with CP . A comprehensive search of 5 database was undertaken up until June 2019 . The PRISMA checklist was then utilised to report on the process of selecting eligible papers . A total of 30 observational studies met the full inclusion criteria . Further STROBE checklist was employed to report on the observational studies . Periventricular leucomalacia on MRI was found to have a strong association with CVI in all 30 studies . Only 13 studies described dorsal and ventral stream dysfunction . There was ambiguity in the definition of CVI . The overall level of evidence correlating different patterns of CVI and CP and MRI was low . Further studies utilising advances in MRI are needed to understand brain reorganisation and patterns of CVI and suggest rehabilitation therapy inclusive of vision .,Periventricular leucomalacia was the most commonly reported brain lesion associated CVI in children with CP. The role of brain structures such as grey matter and subcortical structures in CVI and CP is largely unknown. Current evidence associating different patterns of CVI with motor types of CP and structural and functional MRI is weak. There is a need for uniform reporting of both brain structure function and CVI classification to help further understanding of CVI.
489,Some theorists have suggested that the ability of visual perspective taking constitutes a rudimentary process of social cognition and as such the ability of VPT in people with autism spectrum disorder has been the focus of intensive research . The present study investigated whether adult males with ASD show signs of implicit VPT in first level VPT tasks in which participants were required to judge whether a target object can be seen from anothers perspective even when they are not explicitly required to take anothers perspective . We examined whether the information from anothers visual perspective interferes with visual processing from the participants own perspective using the reaction time as the main performance indicator in adult males with or without ASD . Eye movement patterns during VPT were analyzed for some participants . The results revealed signs of altercentric interference in neurotypical adults but not in adult males with ASD . The results indicate the possibility that people with ASD may rely on a different strategy than neurotypical adults in completing a first level VPT task .,Neurotypical adult males unintentionally take anothers visual perspective. Autistic adults show no reliable signs of unintentionally taking anothers perspective. Autistic adults rely on atypical strategy in visual perspective taking.
490,Children with probable developmental coordination disorder experience motor problems that negatively influence their self perceptions and increase the risk to develop overweight due to physical inactivity . Whether overweight in children with pDCD has an additional impact on their self perceptions is unclear . Insight in this impact would provide vital information for diagnostics and interventions to enhance physical activity in children with pDCD and overweight . Investigate differences in self perceptions between children with pDCD and overweight children with pDCD without overweight and typically developing children . A total of 366 children aged between 7 and 13 years participated in this study . Thirteen children were categorized as pDCD O 51 children as pDCD NO and 302 children as TD . Self perceptions were assessed with the Self Perception Profile for Children . Children with pDCD O perceived themselves lower in social acceptance than children with pDCD NO and TD children . Children with pDCD NO perceived themselves lower in athletic competence than TD children but not than children with pDCD O . No differences were found for perceived physical appearance and global self esteem . Overweight has an additional negative impact on perceived social acceptance in children with pDCD .,Overweight has an additional negative affect on perceived social acceptance in children with pDCD. Children with pDCD with and without overweight perceive themselves not different with regard to athletic competence physical appearance and global self esteem. Children with pDCD perceive themselves lower for athletic competence than typically developing children.
491,Following Annette Karmiloff Smiths approach to cognitive research this study applied a cross syndrome approach to the social phenotype focusing on social vulnerability and the factors that contribute to it . To identify syndrome specific differences in SV across four neurodevelopmental disorder groups determine the contribution of intellectual disability age or gender to SV and explore its relationship with social interaction style . 262 parents of children Autism Williams syndrome Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Fragile X syndrome and Neurotypical reported on their childs SV quality of SIS and other factors . Heightened SV was not syndrome specific . Instead it was found equally across NDD groups and independently of ID age and gender . Different atypical SISs were also distributed across NDD groups and each were significantly related to SV independent of the factors above and beyond neurodevelopmental diagnosis . The findings emphasise that social phenotypes are best understood as distributed across diagnostic boundaries and offer opportunities to further test the role of varied atypical SISs in the development of heightened SV .,Heightened social vulnerability is evident across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The limitation of IQ to explain social vulnerability is shown by a cross syndrome approach. Atypical social interaction styles vary within and across neurodevelopmental groups. Social interaction styles make a unique contribution to heightened social vulnerability. Social phenotypes are best understood as distributed across diagnostic boundaries.
492,The clinical integration of chromosomal microarray testing promises improvements in diagnostic yields in Autism Spectrum Disorder . While the impact on clinical management is promising for some families the utility perceived by families including the majority for whom results are negative is unclear . With next generation genomic sequencing technologies poised for integration along with promising ASD biomarkers being developed there is a need to understand the extent to which genomic and other biological testing would have utility for the target recipients of these tests and their families . The purpose of the present cross sectional study was to examine the predictors of perceived utility of biological testing among parents of a child with ASD . The Based on A main limitation in the study is the participation rate of 50 thus the possibility of self selection bias can not be ruled out . We also chose to assess perceived utility among parents rather than the individuals with ASD themselves modifying the questionnaire to capture perceived utility from autistic individuals across the lifespan would prove essential in future studies . Finally ongoing validation of the PUB by assessing the PUBs discriminant and convergent validity is still needed . We conclude that the utility of biological testing perceived by families whose child is undergoing genetic testing around ASD diagnosis depends on their unique child and family characteristics . This signifies that engaging families in biomarker discovery for improving the impact of research and care requires systematic input from a representative sample of families .,Integrating biomarkers into autism care pathways requires understanding the perceived utility of biological testing. Perceived utility of biological testing among parents increases with lower child functioning and higher family functioning. Child symptom severity parent stress and appraisal of family centered care were not associated with perceived utility. Developing and integrating biological tests for autism requires systematic input from a representative sample of families.
493,Conventional Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a mainstay in Cerebral Palsy diagnosis . A systematic literature review was performed with the aim to investigate the relationship between structural brain lesions identified by sMRI and motor outcomes in children with CP . Fifty eight studies were included . The results were analysed in terms of population characteristics sMRI gross and fine motor function and their interrelation . White matter lesions were the most common brain lesion types and were present in 57.8 of all children with uCP in 67.0 of all children with bCP and in 33 of the group of mixed subtypes . Grey matter lesions were most frequently registered in children with dyskinesia . No structural anomalies visualized by sMRI were reported in 5.7 of all cases . In all lesion types an equal distribution over the different gross motor function classification system categories was present . The included studies did not report sufficient information about fine motor function to relate these results to structural imaging . The relationship between brain structure and motor outcome needs to be further elucidated in a representative cohort of children with CP using a more standardized MRI classification system .,Periventricular white matter injuries remain the most common cause of bilateral and unilateral spastic CP. Grey matter lesions were most frequently registered in children with dyskinesia n 42.2 . 5.7 of children with CP show no anomalies on sMRI which is still commonly associated with bilateral spastic CP with low ambulatory function. To enhance early diagnosis the relationship between brain structure on MRI and motor outcome needs to be further elucidated in a cohort of children with CP using more advanced imaging and quantified MRI procedures.
494,Sensory processing difficulties are present in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder . However little is known about sensory processing variability in these disorders . The purpose of this study was to explore SPD among children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms in comparison to children with typical development and to determine how potential social confounders may influence these associations . The study involved 452 children aged 612 years . The Short Sensory Profile 2 was used to assess sensory processing patterns . Multiple linear regressions were utilized to investigate the relationship between DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms and sensory processing patterns adjusting for social covariates . Children with DCD and ADHD symptoms showed greater variability of atypical sensory processing patterns compared with TD children . Low registration and sensory sensibility issues were more prevalent in the DCD group . ADHD children showed higher rates of low registration sensory sensibility and sensory seeking and all children in the co occurring symptoms group presented sensory sensibility . This study reports significant variability in sensory processing among children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms using a population based sample . These differences can contribute to understand how neurological and social factors correlates across diagnoses .,Children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms show more sensory processing issues than typically developing children. There is variability in sensory processing patterns between DCD ADHD and typically developing children and within disorder. Sensory processing and social factors interrelate with motor coordination performance inattention and hyperactivity.
495,The current systematic review is the first to systematically explore and synthesis research to date on mathematical abilities in Williams syndrome a rare genetic disorder that results in an uneven cognitive profile . As mathematical development is complex and relies on both domain specific and domain general abilities it is currently not clear what mathematical abilities have been examined in WS and also what the current gaps in this research area are . A total of 27 studies across 22 publications were identified through a systematic review search process . Overall all mathematical abilities except for simple counting and subitizing abilities were reported to be impaired but in line with overall mental age abilities . However the literature to date has not established the underlying causes of these mathematical difficulties in WS . Some studies suggested that mathematical abilities in WS follow an atypical developmental pathway with a greater reliance on verbal abilities than in typical development but coupled with impaired understanding of counting and knowledge of the number system more broadly . However most included studies used different assessments of mathematical skills and there is a lack of studies that have examined more than one particular aspect of mathematical development within the same study . In addition studies have often included large age ranges and small participant samples despite the known large individual variability in WS . Although we know mathematical abilities in WS are impaired this area is under researched and there is a lack of longitudinal studies that provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that underpin mathematical development in WS . Therefore there is a lack of an evidence base to inform interventions or educational practice .,This systematic review identified only 27 studies that have examined mathematical abilities in Williams syndrome WS . The majority of the studies reported that mathematical abilities are delayed in WS and are likely to follow an atypical developmental pathway. There is a lack of information on the cognitive mechanisms that underpin mathematical development in WS leading to a lack of evidence based interventions or changes to educational practice.
496,High levels of anxiety and sleep problems are common features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders . The strong association between sleep and anxiety has been documented in typically developing populations and is thought to be bidirectional . The association between sleep and anxiety in children with FASD has not yet been examined . Caregivers of children with FASD Sleep disturbances and anxiety were at clinical levels for the majority of the FASD group and significantly higher in the FASD group than the TD group . After controlling for age and sex 27 of the variance in anxiety scores in TD children was attributable to sleep problems and 33 in children with FASD . This study highlights associations between parent reported sleep and anxiety in FASD . Sleep disturbances were significant predictors of anxiety in both children with FASD and in TD children . Given the importance of sleep to healthy neurodevelopment there is a pressing need for sleep intervention studies in children with FASD . Early identification and intervention for sleep problems in this condition should be a therapeutic priority .,This is the largest study to examine sleep in FASD. We report that a significant proportion of anxiety can be predicted by sleep problems. This is true for both TD and FASD populations. Children with FASD experienced significantly higher levels of sleep problems and anxiety than TD children the majority at clinical levels. Sleep interventions should be a clinical priority for children with FASD.
497,More people with autism spectrum disorder are now being identified in the criminal justice system and in parallel with this increase the prevalence of ASD in the community has risen more than 150 in the same time period . In this article I will argue that this increase is due to a reclassification of those individuals whose social communicative and behavioural function is at the lower end of the normal range . Put simply extremes of these quantitative traits are now being conceptualised as disorder . This has particular relevance for the criminal justice system as such traits are over represented in this population as such it is likely that increasing numbers of people who are incarcerated will receive an ASD diagnosis . This will have major implications for where best and how best to manage such individuals using a framework of disorder versus difference .,This paper presents a conceptual discussion of autism specttrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The paper includes a discussion of the current genetic underpinning of neurodevelopmental disorders and the implication of this for disorder conceptualisation. Emphasis is placed on the implication of our conceptual understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders for the criminal justice system. The paper also provides an opportunity to reflect on and re consider how we might best classify neurodevelopmental disorders.
498,Although adults are known to have sensory sensitivity differences existing sensitivity scales have been mostly developed for children . The limited number of adult scales measure social emotional features and modalities together . To develop scales for adults that evaluate visual auditory and somatosensory sensitivities as separate domains and independent of social emotional features . Two consecutive studies were conducted using the same methods . Both studies included a pilot auditory and somatosensory scales . The categories were internally consistent can be used to screen sensory sensitivity variability or identify and follow up the outcome of sensory interventions in adults .,SeSS are valid and reliable measures of sensory sensitivities. Visual auditory and somatosensory sensitivity can be measured separately by SeSS. Somatosensation dissociated into subdomains as touch itch and pain.
499,Down syndrome is often characterised by intellectual disability with particular difficulties in expressive language . However large individual differences exist in expressive language across development in DS . In the general population one of the factors associated with variability in this domain is parental depression . We investigated whether this is also the case in young children with DS . Thirty eight children with DS between 8 and 48 months of age participated in this study . Their parents reported on the childrens receptive and expressive vocabularies and on parental depression . Furthermore an experimenter led standardized developmental assessment was administered to the children to test five domains gross motor fine motor visual reception receptive language and expressive language . A cross sectional developmental trajectories analysis demonstrated that expressive language developed at a slower rate in children with DS whose parent reported depression than in those whose parent did not . No differences between groups were found in any other domain . Parental depression is associated with slower rate of expressive language development in young children with DS . These findings suggest that DS and parental depression may constitute a double hit leading to increased difficulties in the development of expressive language .,Parental depression relates to slower rate of expressive language development in young children with Down syndrome. No association with parental depression was found for any other domain. Parental depression and Down syndrome may constitute a double hit on expressive language development.
500,Sleep problems are common among children especially those with developmental disabilities visual impairments and behavioral problems . Past research has indicated a particularly high prevalence of clinically relevant sleep problems for children with CHARGE syndrome who often possess all three of these qualities . To gather additional information regarding the nature of these sleep problems and how they are most commonly treated amongst parents an explorative survey was conducted with 30 parents of children with CHARGE syndrome with comorbid sleep problems using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children as well as demographic and sleep questionnaires developed for use in this study .,Parents reported the most common types of sleep problems for children with CHARGE syndrome were waking at night not enough sleep and falling asleep respectively. 27 of participants reportedly require more than one hour to fall asleep after going to bed on average. Parent reported contributing factors to sleep problems included self regulation difficulties teeth grinding hormonal imbalance problem behaviors and anxiety. Most commonly reported intervention strategies were positive bedtime routines and melatonin treatment and these had higher ratings of perceived efficacy than other.
501,To explore the role of high secure psychiatric care in the assessment and management of individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder using published studies and clinical experience . Key areas of exploration include the prevalence of ASD within HSPC some autism specific issues including clinical and cognitive characteristics psychopathy and emotional regulation presence of incompatibilities and use of seclusion as well as experiences of being detained in HSPC . Developing best practice and a specialist ASD service in HSPC is also discussed . A discussion of available literature supported by clinical experience . Although individuals with an ASD admitted to HSPC comprise a small group they are likely to be overrepresented relative to the general prevalence of ASD in the population and present with specific issues . Whilst individuals report a generally positive experience of HSPC therapeutic outcomes are variable and the factors influencing them poorly understood . Staff knowledge and application of ASD theory and practice appears to have a significant influence on outcomes . Implications Although best practice concerning ASD secure services will continue to be improved and developed the role of HSPC in the assessment and management of some individuals with an ASD who present with complex needs and high risk behaviours remains clear .,Adults with an ASD admitted to HSPC represent a small and diverse group presenting with needs and risk profiles different from other patient groups. Although individuals with an ASD report generally positive experiences within HSPC the factors influencing outcomes remain poorly understood. Among the key factors influencing individual care and management is staff knowledge and application of ASD theory. HSPC serves an important function and can have a positive impact on the care of many individuals with an ASD.
502,Atypical behavioral responses to sensation are reported in a large proportion of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure . Systematic examination of symptoms across the fetal alcohol spectrum in a large clinical sample is needed to inform diagnosis and intervention . To describe the prevalence and patterns of atypical sensory processing symptoms in a clinical sample of children with PAE . Retrospective analysis of diagnostic clinical data from the University of Washington Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network . Participants were ages 3 through 11 years had a diagnosis on the fetal alcohol spectrum and Short Sensory Profile assessment . The proportions of children categorized with definite differences on the SSP across selected clinical and demographic features were examined with chi square analyses . The sample consisted of 325 children 73.2 had SSP total scores in the definite difference range . Atypical sensory processing symptoms were significantly more prevalent among children with higher reported levels of PAE . The prevalence of atypical symptoms was comparably high across age levels of diagnostic severity and other prenatal postnatal risks . Results lend support for altered sensory processing as another domain of brain function affected by the teratogenic impact of PAE guiding clinical work and research .,Atypical sensory processing symptoms were prevalent in a high proportion of children with PAE. Prevalence was similar across severity of diagnoses on the fetal alcohol spectrum. Atypical symptoms were more prevalent with higher levels of confirmed PAE.
503,Over recent decades the number of students diagnosed with learning disabilities and or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders has substantially increased . These students face various challenges and experience stress when receiving higher education . The purpose of this study was to compare two non pharmacological interventions mindfulness and device guided slow breathing with a control group . Seventy three students with attention problems and or learning disabilities were randomly assigned to three groups mindfulness meditation device guided breathing practice and waiting list control . Before and after the intervention physiological and psychological measures were collected . Our results show that only mindfulness practice improved awareness of the present moment and decreased hyperactivity and inattention . Furthermore both mindfulness and practice with device guided breathing were associated with stress reduction as shown by an increase in the galvanic skin response only in the control group . Implementation of the study results may lead to an advance in treating attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities especially among higher education students .,Students with learning disabilities attention problems face challenges and stress. We compared two interventions mindfulness and device guided slow breathing. Mindfulness practice improved awareness and decreased hyperactivity and inattention. Both groups showed decreased galvanic skin response compared to controls.
504,The planning behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during writing remain overlooked . Targeted examination of planning behaviors may help to better understand their heterogeneous writing skills . This study examined overt planning behaviors of three groups of school age children during the planning stage of a standardized narrative writing assessment . Aims explored group differences in time spent planning between and within group differences in overt planning behaviors and relationships between planning behaviors and writing performance as well as age cognitive skills and diagnostic symptom severity . This study included 121 917 year old children . Video recordings captured overt planning behaviors during a two minute prewriting planning stage . Not all participants planned but group membership overwhelmingly did not influence planning likelihood . Groups differed in time spent engaging with the outline with the TD group spending the most time . Groups spent similar amounts of time looking away from the task and looking at the task picture . The TD and ASD groups demonstrated more similar within group level differences in planning behavior s while the ADHD group appeared more variable . The ADHD and TD groups but not the ASD group showed stronger associations between planning behaviors and writing performance . Children with ASD and ADHD differed relative to each other and to TD peers in specific planning behaviors . Implications are discussed regarding instructional practices and needed future research to examine planning during writing in children with developmental disabilities .,Groups predominantly did not differ in their choice to engage in planning. The TD group spent more time than ASD or ADHD groups engaging with their outline. All groups spent minimal time disengaged from the task during planning. ASD and TD groups showed more similar behavioral planning profiles. ADHD and TD groups showed more similar planning and writing associations.
505,Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder of different levels of symptom severity may exhibit a wide range of behaviours and characteristics . There is a limited nutrition related study on children with ASD of different severity in Malaysia . This cross sectional study aims to determine the association between sociodemographic factors parental factors and lifestyle factors with autism severity in children with ASD . A total of 224 children with ASD were included in this study . Their mothers completed a self administered questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics autism severity parenting style parental feeding practices parenting stress childs sleep habits and eating behaviours . As high as 78.1 of the children with ASD demonstrated a high level of autism severity . Multiple linear regression showed that fathers employment status Children with ASD in this study had a high level of autism severity . Regular anthropometric measurements by healthcare professionals should be conducted at the autism intervention centres . It is important to have multidisciplinary collaboration in future research to develop customised guidelines for parents with autistic children .,A high proportion of children with ASD showed a high level of autism severity. Most of the mothers of ASD children adopted an authoritative parenting style. Children with working fathers had a higher autism severity. Children with mothers who were concerned about childs weight showed a higher autism severity.
506,Young people with disabilities are more at risk of experiencing loneliness in later life than their typically developing peers . To identify those who become lonely in later life trajectories of perceived parent and peer support from adolescence to adulthood of young people with a visual impairment were studied . A total of 316 adolescents Perceived parent support followed a linear decreasing course . No association was found between perceived parent support and loneliness in later life . For perceived peer support a quadratic growth pattern was found with an increase in peer support up to age 27 and thereafter a decrease . Both the initial level and the rate of change in perceived peer support significantly predicted loneliness in adulthood . The course of peer support is a better indicator for the risk of loneliness in later life than support from parents . Normative life transitions may affect the already vulnerable social support for young people with a visual impairment . This study highlights the importance of establishing and maintaining peer relationships throughout life .,Trajectories of social support of young adults with VI in relation to loneliness are studied using a longitudinal design. Perceived parent support decreased and perceived peer support first increased and later decreased over time. Adolescents with little peer support at T1 and those with the most rapid decline reported most loneliness later in life. No association was found between perceived parent support and loneliness later in life. Support is needed to foster and expand social networks of young people with VI in adulthood and adolescence.
507,With the surge of intervention research examining ways of supporting students with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive settings there remains a need to examine how technology supports could enhance students learning by offering one size fits one instruction . Furthermore intervention studies focused on teaching students with ASD how to solve fractions are scarce . The purpose of this research study was to examine the effects of providing instruction via video modeling concrete manipulatives a self monitoring checklist and practice for comprehension check on the accuracy of fraction problem solving of three middle school students with ASD . Through the use of single case multiple probe across students experimental design we examined whether a functional relation existed between the intervention and students improved accuracy of solving simple proper fraction problems . All three students improved the accuracy of solving simple proper fraction problems from baseline to intervention sessions and two students generalized the skill to solving whole proper fraction problems . The intervention consisting of VM and concrete manipulatives along with additional behavioral strategies offers an option for teachers to accommodate diverse learning needs of students with ASD in a variety of settings .,Video modeling is an effective method of teaching mathematics topics to students with ASD. All students improved the accuracy of fraction problem solving reaching 100 accuracy by the end of the intervention. Using concrete manipulatives and self monitoring checklist helped students grasp the concept of fraction problem solving. The video modeling instructional package offers an option for teachers to accommodate students diverse learning needs.
508,In this article we focus on the causes of individual differences in Down syndrome exemplifying the multi level multi method lifespan developmental approach advocated by Karmiloff Smith . We evaluate the possibility of linking variations in infant and child development with variations in the risk for Alzheimers disease in adults with DS . We review the theoretical basis for this argument considering genetics epigenetics brain behaviour and environment . In studies 1 and 2 we focus on variation in language development . We utilise data from the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventories CDI,A consideration of the causes of individual differences in Down syndrome at the level of genes epigenetics brain and behaviour linking potential differences in early development with elevated risk for Alzheimers disease. Evaluation of environmental socioeconomic status and genetic chromosome 19 apolipoprotein. genotype modulating risk for AD in adulthood predictors of individual differences in early vocabulary development in a sample of 84 infants and young children with DS. Neither predictor accounted for significant amounts of variance leaving the wide variability unexplained and likely arising from complex individual effects of the DS genotype. There was weak evidence that early development was faster for the. genotype conferring greater AD risk 4 carriers consistent with recent observations in infant attention. Proof of principle that prenatal and neonatal magnetic resonance imaging methods may be used to test the predictive power of measures of early brain structure for variation in DS infant cognitive development. Early brain development represents the concerted effect of the DS genotype. The article argues for the importance of a multi level lifespan developmental approach to explore the origins of individual differences in DS cognition. It hypothesises that in this framework dementia itself may be considered as a developmental disorder. .
509,Executive dysfunction is prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder including prominent difficulties in the two facets of inhibition as well as with selective attention . School based mindfulness has been used in typically developing children to improve executive functioning though this has not been investigated in children with ASD . Therefore the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a school based mindfulness program for improving inhibition and selective attention in children with ASD . Using a quasi experimental pre post design an eight week school based mindfulness program as well as for overall selective attention . The studys findings demonstrate that school based mindfulness holds promise for increasing specific executive functioning abilities in children with ASD .,Inhibition and attention improved following school based mindfulness intervention. Medium effect sizes shown for prepotent response inhibition and interference control. Large effect sizes shown for visual selective attention.
510,Previous studies have supported the advantages of an external focus of attention relative to an internal focus of attention in healthly adults . However effects of attentional focus instructions on skill performance and acquisition in children are equivocal . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of attentional focus instructions on performance of a whole body coordination task in children with and without developmental coordination disorder . Children with DCD and typically developing children were asked to perform 3 countermovement vertical jumps in the IFA EFA and control conditions . The results showed that regardless of childrens motor development proficiency the jump height and vertical take off velocity V The results of the current study showed that EFA relative to IFA instructions could enhance the neuromuscular activation of dynamic contractions of the leg muscles in both children with and without DCD . The findings suggest that the beneficial effects of EFA relative to IFA instructions on childrens motor performance is identical across children with different levels of motor proficiency .,An external focus of attention EFA relative to an internal focus of attention IFA increased jump height in children with and without DCD. EFA instruction relative to an IFA instructions increased vertical velocity at take off in children with and without DCD. An EFA instruction was more beneficial than an IFA instruction independently from childrens motor proficiency.
511,People with Spina Bifida usually experience difficulties with mathematics . In a series of other developmental disorders a magnitude processing deficit was considered to be the main source of subsequent difficulties in mathematics . The processing of magnitude could be numerical or non numerical such as spatial or temporal for instance . However no study yet has examined directly magnitude processes in a population with Spina Bifida . On the other hand recent studies in people with genetic syndromes have suggested that visuospatial and working memory processes play an important role in magnitude processing including number magnitude . Therefore in this study we explored for the first time magnitude representation using several tasks with different visuospatial and working memory processing requirements cognitive skills frequently impaired in Spina Bifida . Results showed children with SB presented a global magnitude processing deficit for non numerical and numerical comparison tasks but not in symbolic number magnitude tasks compared to controls . Importantly visuospatial skills and working memory abilities could partially explain the differences between groups in comparison and estimation tasks . This study proposes that magnitude processing difficulties in children with SB could be due to higher cognitive factors such as visuospatial and working memory processes .,Children with SB demonstrated difficulties in comparing non symbolic magnitudes. For visual and auditory information presented simultaneously or sequentially. Deficit in estimating large numerosities. Preserved abilities in symbolic magnitude comparison tasks. These deficits can be explained partially by WM and visuospatial weaknesses.
512,Life skills instruction is important for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities and an emerging research base exists in which schema instruction is used to support students with IDD . In this single case multiple probe across participants study researchers explored the use of a schematic diagram in conjunction with the system of least prompts to support the acquisition fluency maintenance and generalization of life skills mathematics for secondary students with IDD . Researchers collected data relative to student accuracy and independence in solving problems involving finding the cost of an item after a discount . Researchers collected data across baseline intervention maintenance and generalization phases . Researchers found a functional relation between the intervention package and accuracy for all three students . Students were successful with the schematic diagram however the data for generalization to when no schema was provided were more idiosyncratic . This research holds implications for the use of a schematic diagram to support students with IDD learning life skills mathematical problem solving .,Middle school students with IDD acquired became fluent maintained and generalized finding the cost of an item after a discount. A schematic diagram supported students in accuracy and independence in solving life skills mathematics problems. This study adds to the emerging literature that supports life skills mathematics instruction for students with developmental disabilities.
513,Children with neurodevelopmental disorders commonly experience sleep problems . Williams Syndrome a rare genetic disorder characterised by a complex uneven cognitive profile is no exception . Compared with children with typical development school aged children with WS experience significant sleep disruption shorter sleep duration more night wakings greater bedtime resistance and excessive daytime tiredness . In children with TD sleep problems impede optimal daytime functioning . In WS this could compound existing difficulties . Few studies have examined sleep in very young children with WS and little is known about the early emergence of sleep problems in this population . To date studies have been based on parent report and no studies have objectively assessed sleep patterns using longitudinal approach in toddlers with WS . Thus the current study sought to objectively explore sleep patterns in toddlers with WS . Parents of 38 children completed the Brief Infant Screening Questionnaire and the Medical and Demographics Questionnaire and sleep patterns were assessed using actigraphy . Data were collected longitudinally at ages 18 24 and 30 months . Significant sleep disturbances were present in WS from 18 months old . Sleep duration as measured by actigraphy was significantly shorter in WS at all ages and furthermore parents of children with WS reported more night wakings longer settling times and high levels of parental involvement . Crucially whereas actigraphy showed developmental improvements in sleep quality in TD no longitudinal changes were found in WS . Findings could be instrumental in working towards instigating appropriate timely sleep management in this group thus improving outcomes for children and their families .,Longitudinal and objective sleep patterns in young children with Williams Syndrome. Sleep problems in Williams Syndrome emerge and manifest in early childhood. Shorter sleep durations in Williams Syndrome based on objective measures. Different developmental sleep trajectory in toddlers with Williams Syndrome. Limited sleep support provided for parents who consider sleep problematic.
514,Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia is a common treatment to decrease morbidity . This study aims to describe a individual longitudinal neurodevelopmental trajectories over 5 years in children with perinatal asphyxia treated with hypothermia and b the correlation between movement quality at 3 months and motor developmental outcomes at 5 years of age . In this longitudinal cohort study 18 children were assessed at 3 t Six children showed abnormal movement quality assessed with General Movements t Children without anomalies on the MRI before hospital discharge and normal movement quality at 3 months of age showed normal neurodevelopment at the age of 5 however individual motor trajectories showed variability over time . Presents of abnormal GMs tend to detect CP and developmental problems advocating a developmental surveillance to determine need for early intervention .,Anomalies on MRI correctly detected children with disabilities due to CP. Abnormal scores on GMs correctly indicated CP or other developmental problems. Movement quality at 3 months was correlated with motor outcomes at 5 years of age. Children without severe disabilities showed variation in developmental trajectories. Longitudinal monitoring of development is necessary for decisions on intervention.
515,Studies investigating recognition of facial expressions of emotions in Williams syndrome have reported difficulties in recognising negative expressions of emotion and a reliance on atypically developing underlying processes during task performance . The aim of the study was to extend these findings to the recognition of emotions in auditory domains . Children and adolescents with WS together with chronological and verbal mental age matched typically developing comparison groups were asked to judge expressions of happiness sadness anger and fear in vocal and musical conditions . Total emotion recognition scores did not differ between WS and VMA matched groups but profiles of discrimination across emotion categories were markedly different . For all groups the accessibility of emotion category cues differed across music and speech domains . The results suggested that emotion discrimination is more strongly linked with cognitive ability in WS than in TD . Although WS and TD groups showed a significantly different profile of discrimination across emotion categories similarities in the pattern of discrimination across domains and in the correlates of auditory emotion processing were observed . The results are discussed in the context of typical and atypical developmental trajectories and compensatory mechanisms in WS .,Recognition of negative emotions in music and vocalisations distinguishes WS and TD. Intellectual strengths enable compensation during negative emotion recognition in WS. Musical engagement is associated with improved emotion recognition in WS.
516,Language plays an important role in the development of mathematics . Previous research has shown that both basic and advanced linguistic skills relate to fifth grade advanced mathematics but these effects have not yet been investigated longitudinally or in a linguistically diverse population . The present study first examined the differences between first language and second language learners in advanced mathematics . Second we investigated the extent to which the basic and advanced linguistic skills of first language and second language learners directly and indirectly predict their growth in advanced mathematics from fifth to sixth grade . Participants were 153 first language and 80 second language learners from 10 to 12 years of age . Classroom as well as individual measures were administered . First the results showed lower scores for second language learners on advanced mathematics . Second for both groups of language learners basic linguistic skills were found to indirectly predict the growth in advanced mathematics via arithmetic skills whereas advanced linguistic skills directly predicted the growth in geometry and fractions . These results highlight the general need for opportunities to learn the basic and advanced linguistic skills associated with mathematics over individual native language background .,We examine the role of linguistic skills in advanced mathematics growth. Basic linguistic skills predicted growth in advanced mathematics via arithmetic. Advanced linguistic skills directly predicted the growth in advanced mathematics. Second language learners score below first language learners on advanced mathematics. Linguistic skills matter in advanced mathematics growth regardless of linguistic background.
517,Despite the high frequency of case control studies in the developmental disability literature there is a paucity of research establishing the measurement equivalence of instruments used and particularly those relating to positive perceptions and experiences in family disability research . The present study sought to establish measurement invariance for the Positive Gains Scale across 1219 mothers of children with developmental disabilities 234 mothers of children with spina bifida hydrocephalus and 157 mothers of children without disabilities . A three step test for measurement invariance across the three groups was conducted using Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis . Loadings between the three groups were invariant suggesting the criteria to assume metric invariance was met . However the assumption of scalar invariance was not met suggesting that item intercepts differed between the three groups . Our findings suggest that the PGS can not be meaningfully used to compare outcomes between mothers of children with developmental disabilities and other mothers . These findings may have wider implications for research utilising well being measures to make comparisons with carers of children with developmental disabilities .,The study support internal consistency of the PGS across groups. Measurement invariance could not be established for PGS. Researchers should consider possible biases when using the PGS in case control studies.
518,Given the relationship between physical fitness and motor performance a test battery was developed that measures both components combined . Following the development of the Performance and Fitness battery this study investigated the construct validity with the ultimate aim of identifying attributes that discriminate between different levels of motor abilities and anaerobic or musculoskeletal fitness . In this cross sectional study 34 children with developmental coordination disorder and 34 matched typically developing children participated . The PERF FIT was used to examine known group validity . The PERF FIT items were also compared to test items of well known standardized tests to examine concurrent validity . Concurrent validity was found to be of the expected low to moderate magnitude . Children with DCD were consistently found to have lower levels of motor skill related fitness compared to typically developing children . The PERF FIT seems to be a valid test to measure movement skills musculoskeletal fitness and agility in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years in low resourced communities . The test seems to discriminate between gross motor skills and agility and power in children with and without DCD .,Integrating physical fitness and motor coordination in one test is deemed more ecologically valid. Correlations between motor coordination and functional strength and power items are moderate to low. Children with DCD performed significantly poorer on all items of the PERF FIT compared to typically developing peers. Musculoskeletal fitness is recommended as an integral part of the DCD assessment protocol. The PERF FIT is a valid tool to measure physical fitness and motor coordination in children in low resource communities.
519,Vision impairment can affect various areas of life . The aim of this research was to determine the extent to which adults with vision impairment engage in leisure activities and the quality of that engagement . The research included 78 participants with blindness and 48 with low vision 1960 years of age . The subtest The mean value of the results on the The results indicated the need for more comprehensive analysis of the circumstances which determine how well informed the vision impaired have about their own condition and the dynamics of family and other social relations when designing support programs for people with vision impairment .,The achievements of participants with low vision were significantly better than the blind participants achievements. The results of uninformed participants were significantly poorer than the results of the well informed participants. Participants who lived alone achieved the better scores on the. subtest.
520,An appropriate adult is required by law to support juveniles and vulnerable adults during custody procedures . This paper explored the opinions and knowledge of AAs and how the characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder could disadvantage an individual within a police interview . A questionnaire was administered to AAs who had received training to carry out their duties . AAs were asked a number of questions concerning suspects with ASD . Overall the questionnaire found that AAs had some awareness of the key features of ASD . However AAs were less aware of the possible impact these characteristics could have upon the interview process . Nevertheless when asked about actual practice fifteen incidents were reported where it was deemed that the characteristics of ASD disrupted interview procedures . For example it was reported that suspects with ASD displayed repetitive and rigid behaviour patterns that interfered with the flow of the interview . Encouragingly the self reported data suggested that AAs were able to respond effectively to these actual incidents . That withstanding it is suggested that AA training should include information about how those with ASD might be at a disadvantage within the forensic interview environment and outline strategies that AAs could use to help a person with ASD fully engage within the criminal justice process .,The self reported data suggests that on occassions AAs are required to support peolple with ASD during custody procedures. Self reported data reported occasions where the characteristics of ASD disrupted the interview procedure and AAs were required to intervene. Overall AAs have an awareness of the characteristics of ASD. However training to help AAs develop strategies to assit people with ASD is required
521,Children with Down syndrome are at increased likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder relative to the general population . To better understand the nature of this comorbidity we examined the visuo attentional processes associated with autistic trait expression in children with DS focusing specifically on attentional disengagement and visual search performance . We collected eye tracking data from children with DS and children with idiopathic ASD matched according to chronological age . Seven children with DS had a formal clinical diagnosis of ASD . In children with iASD but not DS higher autistic trait levels were associated with decreased temporal facilitation on a gap overlap task implying increased visuospatial orienting efficiency . In all cases higher autistic trait levels were associated with improved visual search performance according to decreased target detection latency . On a visual search task children with DS ASD outperformed their peers with DS ASD mirroring the phenotypic advantage associated with iASD . We found no evidence of a relationship between attentional disengagement and visual search performance providing preliminary evidence of a differentiation in terms of underlying visuo attentional mechanism . We illustrate the value of progressing beyond insensitive behavioural measures of phenotypic description to examine in a more fine grained way the attentional features associated with ASD comorbidity in children with DS .,Visuospatial orienting efficiency increases with symptom severity in idiopathic ASD. Children with Down syndrome and comorbid ASD display superior search performance. Visuo spatial orienting ability and visual search performance appears unrelated.
522,Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and developmental coordination disorders may show similar clinical sensory motor symptoms . This study aimed to compare motor skills and sensory processing behaviors between these two groups . Methods and Procedures . In this retrospective analysis we examined secondary data and used multivariate analysis of variance to compare the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 and Sensory Processing Measure Home for 21 children with FASD and 21 with DCD without prenatal alcohol exposure ages 513 years . No significant group differences in mean total motor or subtest scores on the MABC 2 were detected but a higher proportion of children with DCD had more severe motor delays . Both groups had sensory processing difficulties but the children with FASD had significantly more sensory processing difficulties on the SPM total score and visual touch body awareness and planning subscales . The sensory processing symptoms in children with FASD distinguished the two groups . These group differences between children with FASD and DCD need corroboration in larger samples but haveimplications for differential diagnosis clinical assessment and targeted intervention .,More children with DCD than FASD had more severe motor delays in motor performance. Atypical sensory symptoms were prevalent in both DCD and FASD groups. Children with FASD had more sensory processing difficulties SPM scales .
523,Research on visuospatial functioning has revealed cognitive challenges for children with autism spectrum disorder nonverbal learning disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . These disorders are characterized by some overlapping symptoms making their diagnosis a challenge . The study aims to clarify the role of visuospatial abilities in their neuropsychological profiles by investigating different visuospatial domains and their interplay with the local global processing . Participants with ASD NLD or ADHD were compared with typically developing children on visuospatial processing speed visuo perceptual abilities visuo constructive abilities and visuospatial working memory . Generalized mixed effects models were performed and receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated to express the usefulness of a local global processing index in discriminating groups . The NLD group was impaired in all domains children with ADHD revealed a heterogeneous profile with greater impairments in visuospatial processing speed ASD and TD groups were comparable . The local global processing index had predictive power in discriminating among groups in visuo constructive task . The study of visuospatial abilities of children with ASD NLD and ADHD might help to understand strengths and weaknesses in their neuropsychological profile and to differentiate between them . Clinical implications of these findings are discussed .,Examines local global visuospatial processing in children with ASD NLD and ADHD. Different profiles of visuospatial abilities emerge for each clinical group. The local global processing index discriminates among groups in visuo constructive task. Results might help to further understand cross disorder similarities and differences.
524,At present it is unclear whether there is a consistent behavioural phenotype for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder that can support screening efforts . There has been a dearth of qualitative studies exploring the behavioural phenotype from the perspective of caregivers raising children with FASD . The current study explores the cognitive and behavioural difficulties and impairments experienced by children with FASD aged between four and 12 years from the perspective of caregivers . Fourteen caregivers of children with FASD participated in telephone interviews . Caregivers were recruited until data saturation occurred . Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcribed interviews using NVivo 12 . Three over arching themes were identified that consisted of subthemes 1 Self regulation behavioural emotional and attention 2 Cognitive abilities academic abilities and learning and memory and 3 Adaptive functioning social skills communication and language skills motor skills and sleep concerns . Multiple subthemes were consistently identified across participants . A further two cross cutting themes were identified children behaving young for their age and inconsistency in behaviour and strategies . Despite the lack of a consistent behavioural phenotype for FASD the findings suggest consistency between caregivers in their reports of the difficulties experienced by children with FASD . The implications for early identification and screening tool development are discussed .,There are few qualitative studies of impairments among children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. We conducted semi structured interviews with caregivers of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Consistent themes in cognitive and behavioural difficulties were identified. Implications for screening and early identification are discussed.
525,Attitudes toward people with disabilities are a frequent subject of studies . However there are few complex studies with personal explanatory variables . Thus in our study we have conducted an analysis at both the individual and classroom level as well as we have examined between levels interactions . 1525 students without disabilities participated in the cross sectional study in which we analyzed attitudes toward people with disabilities and moral identity in traditional and in inclusive classroom settings . The results show that individual and classroom moral identity as well as learning in an inclusive classroom predict a reduction of negative attitudes toward people with disabilities . Moreover we have reported some interesting interactions between these two levels . The results obtained are important for educational practice .,Individual moral identity predicts attitudes toward people with disabilities. Classroom level moral identity predicts attitudes toward people with disabilities. Students in inclusive classes have better attitudes toward people with disabilities. Between levels interactions of variables are observed in this study.
526,Although facing a childs intellectual disability is considered to threaten paternal psychosocial wellbeing in recent years there has also been a burgeoning interest in positive contributions of raising children with ID including posttraumatic growth in parents . 142 fathers of children with ID completed Polish versions of three inventories The Post traumatic Growth Inventory Basic Hope Inventory and General Self Efficacy Scale . The average childs age was 11.06 . The stages of the analysis included descriptive statistics for posttraumatic growth basic hope and self efficacy correlation analysis and the Preacher and Hayes procedure of bootstrapping to test whether GSE mediates the relationship between BH and PTG . 85.91 of fathers of children with ID experience average or high levels of PTG with the highest scores in its two dimensions greater appreciation of life and positive changes in relations with others . PTG is significantly negatively related to a childs age . GSE is a significant mediator of the relationship between BH and PTG . The importance of beliefs for experiencing positive changes as a result of raising a child with disability may be useful in therapeutic and supportive activities offered to fathers who experience difficulties in fulfilling their paternal role .,Over 85 of fathers of children with intellectual disabilities experience average or high levels of posttraumatic growth. Fathers reported greater appreciation of life and positive changes in relations with others. Posttraumatic growth can be partially explained by fathers level of self efficacy and basic hope. Self efficacy mediates the relationship between basic hope and posttraumatic growth in fathers. Therapeutic and supportive activities offered to fathers of children with intellectual disabilities should focus on their beliefs basic hope and self efficacy.
527,Research on play for children with autism and severe learning difficulties has been limited instead much of the research focuses on higher levels of play such as symbolic play . Those studies that present details regarding functional play are focused on examining the extent of the play deficit and limited in depth with respect to the precision of the categories presented . Therefore the current understanding the tools available to support plan and measure play are not sufficiently detailed or focused on children with autism and SLD . The aim of the research was to analyse the functional play actions and establish precise functional play categories though direct observations of children aged 311 diagnosed with a combination of autism and SLD . Free play observations of children diagnosed with autism and SLD were conducted in a natural play situation across three special schools in England . The results reveal four key areas of functional play interacting with one object interacting with two objects interacting with self and interacting with the environment . In addition seven subcategories were established as additional components related to functional play . The results suggest that functional play for children with autism and SLD is far more complex than currently recognised . Through the depth and detail established the categories provide greater understanding of the play characteristics and the most detailed account of the functional play characteristics for this group of children . The analysis provides sensitive measurement scales to support accuracy and precision when planning supporting and measuring small increments of progress in play .,Play is important for all children including children with autism and SLD. Research has focused on the deficits in play skills for children with autism. There are gaps in the evidence regarding content and structures of play. Precise categories of functional play are presented. Functional play is far more complex than currently reconised.
528,The early identification and diagnosis of autism is critical to ensure access to appropriate early intervention and support . Few studies have examined the association between potentially modifiable characteristics of the service system and timelier diagnosis . An online survey was conducted to examine parental experiences of service pathways to an autism diagnosis for their child and to identify child family and service level characteristics that predict the age and timeliness of diagnosis . Participants included 107 parents of children with autism who were diagnosed by 7 years of age and a smaller subgroup of 29 parents who were diagnosed after 7 years of age . Parents of younger children reported that on average it took approximately 12 months and 8 professional consultations to receive a confirmed diagnosis for their child . Parents of older children as well as those who reported they were a sole caregiver or were advised by professionals to wait and see reported more time between first raising concerns and diagnosis . The findings reiterate the importance of proactive professional responses to parental concerns . They also highlight the need for standardised screening and assessment and professional development and training to build capacity in the sector to deliver timely and accurate autism diagnoses .,It took 12 months and eight appointments on average to obtain an autism diagnosis. Passive responses e.g. advising wait and see predicted longer waiting times. Single parents reported that it took longer to receive a confirmed diagnosis. Parents of older children reported a longer time between raising concern and diagnosis.
529,Even genetic disorders associated with monogenic aetiologies are characterized by complex and variable risk for poor outcomes highlighting the need to follow trajectories longitudinally . Here we investigated the longitudinal relationships between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder symptoms in a population at high risk for both boys with fragile X syndrome . 59 boys with fragile X syndrome aged 310 years old at entry participated in this study and were followed up one and two years after their first visit . As expected we found strong relationships over three timepoints for ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms . In addition using structural equation modeling we found that ADHD symptoms at time 2 predicted ASD symptoms at time 3 suggestive of a causal relationship . Importantly these relationships hold when including chronological age at entry to the study as well as when including severity of impairment as measured by IQ and their effects on both ASD and ADHD symptoms do not reach significance . This result highlights the need to study outcomes longitudinally and it informs the comorbidity of the two symptom domains in FXS as well as their potential directionality both of which have been little researched . In addition our findings may suggest a future need to study how ADHD symptoms and their treatment impact individuals with ASD .,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and autism spectrum disorder ASD symptoms relate longitudinally in fragile X syndrome. Correlations held over three time points for ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms. Structural equation modeling SEM showed that ADHD symptoms at time 2 predicted ASD symptoms at time 3. This result highlights the need to study outcomes longitudinally. Findings inform the comorbidity of the two symptom domains in FXS.
530,Fragile X syndrome is characterised by atypical social behaviours such as gaze aversion . However it remains unclear whether or if so how these behaviours affect cognitive processing and influence memory . We asked children with FXS and typically developing children to explore naturalistic scenes containing social and non social salient items unrelated to their task at hand . We also assessed childrens memory for target locations . We complemented behavioural responses with eye tracking data for the subset of participants who managed to comply with calibration and the demands of the experimental testing session . Children with FXS performed well at the experimental task and showed similar accuracy and speed in locating targets in natural scenes to children of equivalent verbal abilities . They also learned target locations over blocks but their memory of target locations was not as precise as that of comparison children . In addition children with FXS initially directed few first looks to salient social items within the scenes but these looks increased over blocks . Like TD children children with FXS also dwelled gaze upon social items while recalling target locations from memory . Individual differences in everyday social characteristics also related to gaze and behavioural measures . In conclusion experimental approaches can highlight cognitive underpinnings of atypical social behaviour in FXS pinpointing both similarities and differences to TD individuals .,We investigated longitudinal relationships between ADHD and autism symptoms in boys with fragile X syndrome. We found strong relationships over three timepoints for ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms. Using structural equation modeling SEM we found that ADHD symptoms at time 2 predicted ASD symptoms at time 3. This result highlights the need to study outcomes longitudinally and it informs the comorbidity of the two symptom domains in FXS.
531,Prior research examining typically developing siblings of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder reports both higher and lower levels of prosocial behavior among TDS . TDS experiences and perceptions of experiences may interact to influence TDS prosocial behavior . 1 Examine influences of TDS experiences and perceptions of TDS experiences on prosocial behavior and 2 examine interactions between TDS experiences of parentification and perceptions of experiences influencing prosocial behavior while controlling for the Broad Autism Phenotype . TDS Controlling for gender and BAP there was a significant interaction between ASD benefit finding and sibling focused parentification such that at low levels of ASD benefit finding sibling focused parentification negatively predicted prosocial behavior . Lower BAP scores and female gender were associated with greater levels of prosocial behavior . TDS experiences and perceptions of experiences are important for understanding TDS prosocial behavior .,Experiences and perceptions of experiences are important for TDS prosocial behavior. ASD benefit finding is a moderator of TDS prosocial behavior. Parentification predicts TDS prosocial behavior.
532,Although research has provided evidence for a clear association of core executive function to math performance fewer studies have been carried out on arithmetic fact retrieval in relation to the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . The present study assessed mathematical achievement on a basic number skill test and on an arithmetic fact retrieval task . Besides math achievement self ratings of ADHD symptoms core executive functions and state anxiety in 646 fourth and fifth grade students were measured . CEF was evaluated by means of a tablet based test . Regression analysis showed different predictors for both math abilities . While all CEF measures inattention and impulsivity self ratings predicted basic number skills only inhibition WMC and inattention self rating were predictors of arithmetic fact retrieval . On the basis of a cluster analysis of ADHD self ratings and CEF performance three different groups were identified 1 low ADHD average CEF 2 high ADHD low CEF 3 moderate ADHD high CEF . Cluster 2 showed scores below the mean in both math scores whereas cluster 3 exhibited performances above the mean in both math scores . No math differences were found between cluster 1 and 3 . The data yield evidence that the association between CEF and math achievement depends on the specific math skill and test type . The results underline the importance of differentiating between CEF components and specific math abilities . Implications for future research on the associations between mathematics ADHD and CEF are discussed .,Only inhibition control and WMC explained math retrieval difficulties while all CEF components seem to be involved in basic number skills. The data showed stable and similar negative associations between inattention self ratings and both math skills. Children with ADHD traits presented clear difficulties in basic number skills. Future research should consider dissimilar executive functioning profiles which would help to fully explain the math difficulties of children with CEF and attention deficits.
533,Knowledge of obstetric and environmental influences on Developmental Coordination Disorder helps provide increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disorder . However the literature to date has not adequately examined the obstetric and environmental risk factors for DCD in a population based sample . The current study was therefore conducted to explore the prenatal perinatal neonatal and family environmental risk factors for DCD . A total of 2185 children aged 310 years from a national representative sample in China were included the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 was used to assess motor function and a questionnaire was completed by parents . DCD was identified in 156 children according to the DSM 5 criteria . Multilevel logistic regression was used and comparisons were made between the DCD and non DCD group . The results confirmed that male sex BMI score preterm birth and some prenatal conditions are significant risk factors for DCD . Parents education level and one child status as two significant environmental risk factors for DCD appear largely independent of other risk factors in the Chinese population . This study provides an opportunity to explore the etiology of DCD and suggest potential assessment monitoring and intervention programs for DCD that could be examined in the future .,Obstetric and environmental factors both predict DCD independently. Male sex and higher BMI are risk factors for DCD. Placenta previa and placental abruption are independent risk factors for DCD. Preterm birth is an independent risk factor for DCD. Parents education and one child status are independent risk factors for DCD.
534,The current study utilized a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery to investigate cognitive abilities in a sample of 49 WS individuals aged 639 years . Age effects were also investigated by splitting the sample into child and adult groups . Cognitive heterogeneity was found on the Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities Australian Adaptation,Cognitive abilities ranged from profoundly impaired to superior. Many 70 of WS individuals showed intact visual spatial functioning auditory processing and Phonemic awareness skills. Many 70 were impaired on select measures of executive functioning processing speed and attention as well as delayed visual auditory learning. There was cognitive heterogeneity both in terms of absolute levels of ability and in terms of profiles of strength and weakness.
535,Autism and intellectual disability may coincide and be preceded by global developmental delay or by motor delay . Motor delay in the context of global developmental delay is an initial red flag for ASD with added risk in girls . To assess early developmental milestones in girls with ASD as compared to diagnosed boys considering prematurity risk . Developmental milestones in a cohort of 467 children with ASD diagnosed at mean age of 3.4 years were analyzed according to gender and prematurity risk . 111 girls 356 boys presented with motor milestones acquisition grossly within the normal range . However there was a shift towards acquisition of walking being at the later end of the norm range with this shift being more prominent in girls . 60 of girls and 47 of boys with ASD had motor delay and 49 of girls and 36 of boys had global developmental delay . The extent of the delays was greater in the prematurity subgroup . Global delay of early milestones occurred in half of children with ASD and in 60 of girls with ASD . Delayed acquisition of independent walking is relatively more common in girls subsequently diagnosed with ASD .,Motor delay is a red flag for autism. Motor and global developmental delays are more common in girls with autism. Motor and global developmental delays were greater in the prematurity subgroup. Prematurely born girls with autism spectrum disorders have an elevated risk of showing motor or global developmental delays
536,Profiles of mathematical learning disability have been conceptualized in the literature but empirical evidence to support them based on academic and cognitive characteristics is lacking . We examined whether profiles of mathematics performance can empirically be identified and whether the identified profiles also differ in underlying cognitive skills . Latent profile analysis in 281 fourth graders . Basic arithmetic and advanced mathematics were used to identify profiles . Cognitive skills were then described for each profile of mathematics performance . Four profiles of mathematics performance were retrieved from the data including one general low achieving profile . Additional profiles of MLD were not found possibly because individual variation was substantial . It is highly important to understand childrens mathematics performance from an individual perspective rather than by averaging these children over subgroups . These new insights can be used to better tend to the specific needs of children with mathematical difficulties .,Different profiles of mathematics performance have been theorized in the literature. The present study empirically identified one generally low achieving profile. Specific profiles of mathematical learning disabilities were not identified. Individual variation was too large for a meaningful distinction between profiles. Heterogeneity in math performance should therefore be acknowledged.
537,Temperament is an important construct that shapes child development . Temperament is suggested to present differently in different groups such as children with neurodevelopmental disorders . However it is not known whether there are specific temperament features associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder . This systematic review aimed to synthesise extant literature to determine whether there are temperament features associated with ASD in infancy toddlerhood and childhood . Following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews we searched PsycINFO CINAHL Academic Search Ultimate and ProQuest for all available articles from database conception until January 2020 . The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklists were used to assess the methodological quality of included articles . Twenty six articles met the selection criteria reported on the temperament of children diagnosed with ASD peer reviewed and published in English . Articles varied in overall methodological quality . Infants later diagnosed with ASD were found to more frequently be described as having easy temperament features in early infancy compared to typically developing infants and infants with developmental concerns but not ASD . Once diagnosed children with ASD were reported to as a group display more negative affect less extraversion and less effortful control than typically developing children . The literature suggests that more challenging temperament features are associated with ASD in childhood but less is known about within group variability . Overall this review highlights the need for further investigation into the variability of temperament in children with ASD .,In early infancy infants later diagnosed with ASD had easy temperament features. In mid to late infancy temperament of infants later diagnosed with ASD was reported to be more challenging. Children with ASD displayed more challenging temperament features than typically developing peers. Further research is needed into the variability of temperament in children with ASD.
538,Raising a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder or disability presents unique challenges to the family and presence of behavior problems has been identified as a critical risk factor for a broad range of family outcomes . The current study examines whether caregivers perceptions of child and family service adequacy mediate or moderate the relation between childrens behavioral difficulties and negative family impact . Caregivers provided data for 215 children with NDD D completing measures of child behavior problems perceived child and family service inadequacy and family impact . Both child and family service inadequacy partially mediated but did not moderate the association between child behavior problems and perceived negative family impact . The current study highlights that all families of children with NDD D are in need of support irrespective of the severity of their childs behavioral difficulties . Furthermore the findings reinforce that access to a range of supports serving,The link between child behavior problems and negative family impact is established. Child and family service inadequacy emerged as partial mediators of the association. Child and family service inadequacy did not moderate the relationship. Families of those with NDD D need support irrespective of behavior problem severity. Supports serving both the child and family are critical.
539,Participation of children with ID it is argued must be understood in relation to the fit with the environment . Since caregivers are a vital factor within the close environment of a child with intellectual disability their perceptions are unequivocally important . The main aim of this study is to describe the self reported participation of children with ID and the perceptions of their primary caregivers . Both frequency of attendance and perceived importance of activity was measured with self reported and proxy reports . Overall the perceptions of children with intellectual disabilities and of primary caregivers showed similarities regarding attendance and activities considered important . On group level both children and primary caregivers perceived the child to have a high level of attendance of While primary caregivers and childrens ratings of attendance and selection of the most important activities appeared somewhat similar there was a noted difference in that primary caregivers were uniform in their selection whilst there was a diversity in the selection of activities amongst children .,Participation in everyday activities is important as it provides the context in which to develop new skills. Self ratings and proxy ratings of participation by children with intellectual disabilities and their primary caregivers show similarities. While childrens and primary caregivers perceptions of participation generally showed similarities there was a noted difference in both frequency of attendance and selection of most important activities in the child primary caregiver dyads. This study makes an important contribution to the argument for including the self reported perceptions of children with ID in clinical practice and future research endeavours.
540,Parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder exhibit higher levels of parental stress than parents of typically developing children . The most frequently used tools to assess parental stress is the Parenting Stress Index or its Short Form . This study was designed to test the validity of the PSI SF in French parents of children with ASD . First a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test the initial 3 factor structure which indicate a poor model fit . Then an exploratory factor analysis was performed and convergent validity was assessed . A 3 factor structure explaining 44 of the variance was observed . Dimensions were moderately correlated and exhibited good internal consistency . Convergent validity was checked through the PSI SF association with anxiety and depression quality of life and appraisal of being a parent of a child with ASD . Future research should use the full version of the PSI SF and examine its factor structure . More studies on the factor structure of the PSI SF are needed to find out if it is a suitable tool for measuring stress in parents of children with ASD in France .,Parents of children with ASD report high level of parental stress. The PSI or its short form is the most used tool for assessing parental stress. This study assessed the psychometric properties of the PSI SF in ASD in France. EFA gives a 3 factor model 21 items with good structure and convergent validity. Removed items were related to the specificities of ASD and the French context.
541,Developmental coordination disorder interferes with academic achievement and daily life and is associated with persistent academic difficulties in particular within mathematical learning . In the present study we aimed to study numerical cognition using an approach that taps very basic numerical processes such as subitizing and counting abilities in DCD . We used a counting task and a subitizing task in forty 710 years old children with or without DCD . In both tasks children were presented with arrays of one to eight dots and asked to name aloud the number of dots as accurately and quickly as possible . In the subitizing task dots were presented during 250ms whereas in the counting task they stayed on the screen until the participants gave a verbal response . The results showed that children with DCD were less accurate and slower in the two enumeration tasks providing evidence that DCD impairs both counting and subitizing . These impairments might have a deleterious impact on the ability to improve the acuity of the Approximate Number System through counting and thus could play a role in the underachievement of children with DCD in mathematics .,DCD impairs counting and subitizing in children. Deleterious impact may be expected on the ANS and mathematical abilities at school. Educational practice should avoid traditional counting exercises with DCD children.
542,Previous studies have reported an inverse relationship between adaptive behavior and challenging behaviors in individuals with ID . However it is unclear which characteristics might influence this relationship in individuals with ID and co occurring conditions . We found a positive correlation between adaptive behavior and challenging behaviors in a study of 105 individuals who presented with mostly severe to profound ID and comorbid physical and mental health conditions . These results might be the consequence of the individual participant characteristics . Therefore participants were separated out into two groups representing the top,Minimum adaptive skills are necessary for the expression of challenging behaviors. Adaptive and challenging behaviors are related in severe and profound ID. Challenging behaviors are related with more restrictive settings.
543,A balanced approach to decision making during challenging times is necessary in order to avoid risks that jeopardize the lives and wellbeing of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities . The COVID 19 pandemic is the recent example of a crisis that places people with IDD at risk for lopsided societal reactions and threats to them or their wellbeing . Attention to decision making is required to safeguard hard earned achievements including public policies and organization practices that emphasize human and legal rights self advocacy individualized supports inclusive environments choices and community inclusion . We suggest maintaining a holistic approach to understanding the lives and human functioning of people with IDD a balanced approach to accountability and performance management an understanding of the multidimensional properties of context and a heightened vigilance in professional responsibility . A balanced approach will strengthen the likelihood of a return to high quality services and supports to people after the crisis reduce loss of critical progress and enhance stability across future social political and financial changes and challenges .,COVID 19 presents significant risks to progress that has been achieved in the lives of people with IDD. Decision making should incorporate a holistic approach to understanding the lives and human functioning of people with IDD. Analysis of the multidimensional properties of context and heightened vigilance in professional responsibility will aid decisions. A balanced approach will help assure a return to high quality services and supports reduce loss of critical progress and enhance stability.
544,Clinicians working with individuals with autism spectrum disorders who display sexual offending behaviours may face challenges during treatment as a result of the cognitive and behavioural profile associated with ASD . This research explored the views and experiences of those running adapted sex offender treatment groups with men with ASD . Semi structured interviews with group facilitators focused on service user engagement and response to the core components of the treatment programme and gathered the experiences of those working with men with ASD who display sexual offending behaviours . Grounded Theory was used to develop a model conceptualising the potential impact of ASD on treatment outcomes and this emerged predominantly through clinicians views of risk of re offending . Benefits of attending a group included the presence of other group members a forum to develop pro social roles and relationships and increased opportunity for monitoring . Challenges regarding empathy specifically emotional empathy and shifts in cognitive distortions were felt particularly pertinent to those with ASD as well as questions over internalisation of therapy . Despite identification of a number of challenges adapted sex offender treatment programmes were considered beneficial for men with ASD especially in light of a dearth of evidenced based alternatives .,Views indicated ASD symptomatology impacts on treatment outcomes for sex offenders. Interviews suggest sexual offenders with ASD can benefit from group CBT programmes. Clinicians face challenges in increasing empathy and shifting cognitive distortions.
545,Research shows that a substantial proportion of people with Autism come into contact with the police in their lifetime and some research suggests that they are largely unsatisfied with their police interactions . Thirty five adults with ASD completed an online questionnaire regarding the challenges police may face when interacting with Autistic people as well as provided recommendations as to how those interactions could be improved . Respondents reported a variety of different potential challenges that could present in an interaction between the police and people with ASD . For example respondents felt that typical Autistic behaviours such as stimming or communication difficulties could be misinterpreted by police officers and lead to adverse outcomes . Respondents discussed several recommendations aimed at improving police interactions with Autistic people including involving Autisitc people in the training of police officers . The information collected in this study provides insights into how interactions between the police and people with ASD can be improved . These findings can be used in the development of police training programs or integrated into pre existing training programs on Autism contributing the invaluable perspective of the Autism community .,ASD respondents were concerned about how their disability would affect police treatment. ASD respondents identified several potential challenges that could present in a police interaction. A variety of recommendations were offered regarding how future interactions could be better managed.
546,Pathological Demand Avoidance is a developmental disorder involving challenging behaviour clinically linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder . Many of the problematic features of PDA are often seen in persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and impulsivity . ADHD and impulsivity are also common in the backgrounds of offenders . Method and procedure We examined if self reported ASD ADHD impulsivity and general personality traits such as low conscientiousness and low emotional stability predicted self reported PDA scores and which constructs contributed to the prediction of delinquency recruiting 132 participants of whom 126 cases had complete data . Many of these constructs but particularly ADHD This research indicates that for community adult populations self reported individual differences in ADHD emotional instability and antagonism appear to better predict PDA than ASD . The association PDA has with delinquency may reflect these constructs which are also correlates of offending .,Pathological demand avoidance PDA is associated with challenging behaviour. PDA involves behaviours suggestive of clinical syndromes other than autism. High attention deficit antagonism and low emotional stability predict PDA. Neither PDA or autistic spectrum ratings predicted delinquency.
547,This report maps autism and special education needs policies alongside teacher responsibilities in the education of children with SEN in Austria Hungary Czech Republic and Slovakia . A policy path analysis using a scoping review as an underlying methodological framework was performed . The end of communism and accession to the European Union were critical for the countries under study . They passed crucial policies after international policies and adopted a three stream approach towards providing education special schools special classes in mainstream schools or mainstream classes . Special schools remain for children that can not participate in mainstream schools . Teachers are given high levels of responsibility . Changes in international guidance greatly impacted Austria Hungary Slovakia and the Czech Republic . The education systems aim for inclusion though segregation remains for children that can not thrive in mainstream schools . Teachers are pivotal in the education of children with SEN more so than with typical children .,Special education needs are addressed on a policy level in all four countries. Teachers play a critical role in SEN educationmore so than mainstream education. Implementation of inclusion practices varies significantly across countries. Autism specific policy is scarce and most countries rely on general SEN policy.
548,Approximately 71 454 children younger than 5 years old have a disability in Ecuador . Our objective was to compare and relate family cohesion adaptability coping perceived stress and control with family satisfaction of Ecuadorian mothers of preschool children with and without intellectual disabilities . Participants were 384 Ecuadorian mothers 111 had a child with ID and 273had a child without ID . The FACES II Family Satisfaction Scale and Moos Coping Response Inventory were used . No significant differences were found between mothers of children with and without intellectual disabilities on their perceptions of family cohesion adaptability or family satisfaction . Mothers of children with ID perceived less stress and more control over their children and adopted more approach coping strategies compared to mothers of children without ID . The mothers family satisfaction was positively related to approach coping strategies and to family cohesion and adaptability and negatively related to avoidant coping strategiesregardless of whether their children had a disability or not . These data are in accordance with an adaptive approach to disability and emphasise the capacity of individuals and families to cope .,Scarcity of comparative studies regarding caregiving and Ecuatorian mothers of young children with and without disabilities. No significant differences between mothers of preschool children with and without IDs in family cohesion adaptability and satisfaction. Mothers of children with IDs used more approach coping strategies than mothers of children without IDs. Mothers of children with IDs felt less stress and more control than mothers of children without IDs. Higher family satisfaction was related to higher family cohesion and adaptability more approach coping and less avoidant coping strategies.
549,People with autism spectrum disorders and people with intellectual disabilities are stigmatized and therefore discriminated against worldwide and on many occasions this stigma and discrimination are expanded to include their family caregivers . The main objective of this research was to examine the consequences of perceived discrimination on family caregivers of children with ASD and children with ID . The sample consisted of 109 Spanish caregivers of children with ASD and 83 caregivers of children with ID . They completed four questionnaires Multidimensional Perceived Discrimination Scale Affiliate Stigma Scale Social Support Questionnaire and Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale . Using path analysis we found support for a model in which personal discrimination perceived by caregivers was positively associated with affiliate stigma which in turn was negatively related to caregivers self esteem . The model also shows the total mediational role of affiliate stigma in the association between perceived discrimination and self esteem and the partial mediational role that social support plays in the association between perceived discrimination and caregivers self esteem . Caregivers perceived discrimination negatively influences caregivers self esteem but this relationship is mediated by both affiliate stigma and social support . These results have theoretical and practical implications and may contribute to improving the quality of life of parents of children with ASD and ID that in turn would result in an improvement of the quality of life of their children .,Discrimination increases affiliate stigma in parents of children with ASD and ID. Affiliate stigma is negatively related to parents self esteem. Affiliate stigma mediates the effect of discrimination on parents self esteem. Social support prevents the effect of discrimination on parents self esteem.
550,Autism is characterised by phenotypic variability particularly in the domains of language and handedness . However the source of this heterogeneity is currently unclear . To synthesise findings regarding the relationship between language handedness and cerebral lateralisation in autistic people and consider how future research should be conducted in order to progress our understanding of phenotypic variability . Following a literature search and selection process 19 papers were included in this literature review . Studies using behavioural structural and functional measures of lateralisation are reviewed . The studies reviewed provided consistent evidence of differential cerebral lateralisation in autistic people and this appears to be related to between group differences in language . Evidence relating this to handedness was less consistent . Many of the studies did not include heterogeneous samples and or did not specify the language process they investigated . This review suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between cerebral lateralisation and phenotypic variability within autism . It is crucial that future studies in this area include heterogeneous samples specify the language process they are investigating and consider taking developmental trajectories into account .,Language lateralisation and language ability appear to be related in autism. This relationship does not appear to be mediated by handedness. Most studies included homogeneous autistic samples with respect to language ability. Many studies did not specify the language process that was investigated. We make a number of recommendations for future research in the field.
551,When considering sensory discrimination studies multiple d prime values are often obtained from several sensory attributes . In this paper we introduce principal component analysis as a way of gaining information about d prime values across sensory attributes . Specifically we propose estimating d prime values using a Thurstonian mixed model for binary paired comparison data and then using these estimates in a principal component analysis . Binary paired comparisons are a sensitive way to test products with only subtle differences . When analyzing data with a Thurstonian mixed model product specific as well as assessor specific d prime values are obtained . Principal component analysis of these values results in information about products and assessors across multiple sensory attributes illustrated by product and attribute maps . Furthermore the analysis captures individual differences . Thus by using d prime values from a multi attribute 2 AFC study in principal component analysis insights that are typically obtained considering quantitative descriptive analysis are obtained .,Considering. values obtained from sensory discrimination testing. Analyzing. values from binary paired comparisons by Principal Component Analysis. Comparing multiple products across several sensory attributes. Gaining information about individuals across multiple sensory attributes.
552,The purpose of this study was to design a pattern of sustainable behaviour of consuming organic products involving three phases cognition motivation and volition . The theory of planned behaviour was selected as the basis of a study of consumer behaviour . For the development of the model a combination of self determination theory planning and other factors was used based on a literature review . The theoretical framework is presented as 15 hypotheses . The results showed that the statistical hypotheses were confirmed at a significance level of 0.05 . However low self determination did not affect intention . Thus H11 was not supported . A significant relationship was identified among the confirmed structures in all three phases studied herein and the estimated field model explained approximately 55 of the variance of the overall behaviour of organic product consumption . The most important variables in the cognitive phase were environmental concerns with a path coefficient of 0.45 in the motivation phase attitude towards behaviour had a path coefficient of 0.52 and during the volition phase action planning had a path coefficient of 0.54 . Considering the combination of the cognitive motivation and volition phases using actions to inform and persuade and availability may increase the sustainable behaviour of consuming organic products and may help managers and policymakers achieve their goals . Suggestions are developed in the closing part of the paper .,Cognition motivation and volition are effective for the consumption of organic products. Action planning and coping planning describe intentions and behaviour gaps. The effect of internal motivation on intention was greater than the effect of external motivation. Abstract values have a greater impact on the attitude towards organic product consumption.
553,Product texture and mouthfeel contribute significantly to product appreciation . For medical nutrition products the textural properties also contribute to both swallowing efficiency and safety therefore impacting the nutrition and fluid intake of individuals in need of adapted textures . The need for an international terminology in a medical context has been expressed through several initiatives . The main reason was the inconsistency in mouthfeel terminology usage per country and care provider . A consistent terminology is important when selecting and preparing a safe and acceptable MNP . Current terminology is not specific to MNP making it challenging to develop optimal MNP and communicating about them . The objective of the current study was to develop a hierarchically structured mouthfeel terminology suited to MNP . This terminology was developed with expert sensory panelists describing the mouthfeel terminology of 32 products resulting in 9 umbrella terms and 51 individual attributes . To categorize the terminology appropriately and to make it accessible to a wide range of users Taxonomic Free Sorting was used to develop a hierarchical structure which is represented as a wheel . This structured terminology should assist sensory expert panels Health Care Professionals carers individuals in need of adapted textures chefs food technologists and sensory scientists in their interpretation and use of terminology related to mouthfeel of MNP . Ultimately the mouthfeel wheel was developed as a communication tool to support product improvement and selection of MNP by HCP with an optimized mouthfeel for individuals in need of adapted textures .,Mouthfeel contributes significantly to food perception and is an important driver of food liking. A hierarchically structured mouthfeel terminology unique to medical nutrition products was developed emphasizing the need for consistency customization and categorization. Ultimately the mouthfeel wheel was developed as a communication tool to support product improvement and selection of medical nutrition products by health care professionals.
554,Nudging is nowadays often used in order to influence peoples behaviours . However we are convinced that nudging can also influence peoples speeches . In a product development context consumers are more and more integrated in the process how integrate them in the most efficient way Whereas formatted measures can be easily analysed but are far from the consumers measures that seem to be closer to the consumers are often very difficult to analyse . A trade off has to be found in order to get data that are at the same time as close as possible to consumers mind and relevant for the ones who develop new products . In this context we proposed a new strategy based on the nudge theory called Free JAR Profiling . Its first step invites consumers to classify products into 3 hedonic categories . This classification impact consumers speeches in a soft way as it places consumers in a hedonic state of mind and allows them to easily structure their thoughts toward product improvement keys . The second step invites consumers to assess the products according to their own vocabulary but with a constraint on how they give their opinion based on a JAR scale . This strategy allows to have access to oriented and structured data which mix the consumer spontaneity strength and the R D approach of JAR scales . The added value and the relevance of these nudged data can be checked and a,The nudge theory can be used in order to influence consumers speeches. JAR and free comments data recording have limits in a product development context. The Free JAR lets consumers freely express themselves while shaping their speech. Sentiment analysis is used in order to check the consistency of the Free JAR data. The Sentiment Mapping positions products against each other in an ergonomic way.
555,This study explored Chinese consumers choice motives motive dimensions segmentation and species preferences on luxury seafood consumption . A web based survey was administered to 967 luxury seafood eaters from three cities Beijing Shenzhen and Shanghai . The data were analysed by descriptive analysis principal component analysis cluster analysis and linear regression analysis . A two dimensional construct was obtained for Chinese consumers choice motives for luxury seafood food value and symbolic value . The most important specific motives attached to these two dimensions included umami delicious fresh like to eat show status face consciousness high quality life and networking . Luxury seafood consumption by Chinese consumers was more significantly influenced by the symbolic value motivation dimension than the food value dimension . Two consumer segments were found food value seeker and dual value seeker . Lobster and salmon were the most common luxury seafood species consumed in China .,Consumer behavior toward luxury seafood in China. A two dimension construct for choice motives of luxury seafood. Two consumer segments at different choice motive dimensions. Important choice motivation dimensions on luxury seafood consumption. Frequently consumed luxury seafood species.
556,Temporal Dominance of Sensations and Temporal Check all that Apply from three different case studies are compared by means of canonical correlation analysis orthogonalization and principal component analysis of the vertically unfolded data . The multivariate analyses decompose the datasets into common and distinct components . The results showed that the major part of the variation is common between the two methods for the cases investigated but that there were subtle differences showing better discrimination for TCATA than TDS . TDS showed a more complex data structure and more unique variation . The unique variation in TDS is however difficult to interpret . The methods are more different towards the end of the mastication this can be explained both by the difficulty of assessors to agree on the dominant attributes at the bolus stage for TDS and that assessors may forget to unclick attributes in TCATA . This work builds on recent methodological studies on temporal methods that aim to better understand differences among methodologies and ultimately to identify what methods could be better for answering different objectives .,TDS and TCATA are compared by common and distinct components. Common components are identified by canonical correlation analysis. Distinct components are found after orthogonalization. Results indicate only subtle differences between the methods. TCATA give better discrimination of samples in all case studies.
557,This study was the first to use virtual reality for disgust research and pursued two aims . First we explored whether it was possible to induce disgust in a virtual environment . Second we examined the relationship between food disgust sensitivity presence and participants willingness to eat a food item after exposure to a virtual disgust cue . We asked 100 participants to eat chocolate and complete a tasting experiment within a virtual environment while wearing a head mounted HTC Vive device . The control group,Disgust can be elicited in a virtual environment. Virtual disgust stimuli influence participants behaviour. Virtual reality can be used to introduce disgust elicitors. Virtual reality is a powerful and promising tool for use in disgust research.
558,The globalization of food markets and the recent upgrade of the European regulation on novel foods open up new possibilities for the introduction of edible jellyfish in the diet of Europeans . In spite of no tradition of eating jellyfish in Italy and more generally in Western countries several Mediterranean jellyfish species have biological and nutritional features with a large potential as innovative sustainable novel food and source of bioactive compounds . To evaluate the Italians attitude of considering jellyfish as food source a survey has been carried out on a group of 1445 individuals . A questionnaire was designed to assess the jellyfish consumption attitude of respondents and explore the effect of their individual traits on JCA . Gender age and travelling habits differently affected JCA . Possible culinary uses and food pairing of jellyfish were also significantly influenced by JCA . Individuals with the highest propensity to accept jellyfish as food are young people familiar with the sea environment with high education level or students and frequent travelers . Food neophobia and sensitivity to disgust are confirmed as personality traits able to strongly impair the acceptability of a novel food . Finally this work provides insights into the acceptance and rejection variables that should be taken into account when an unfamiliar new food product such as jellyfish is planned to be introduced in a new dietary culture and new markets .,Attitude towards jellyfish consumption JCA as novel food was assessed in an Italian sample. 1445 respondents were classified in. and. JCA clusters. Food neophobia and sensitivity to disgust were negatively associated to JCA. JCA was mostly affected by gender age education level and travelling habits. JCA influenced the culinary uses and food pairing of jellyfish.
559,The main objective of the present study was to determine the effect of the concentration range of sweetener on the accuracy of sweetness potency defined as the ratio of target sweetener and sucrose concentrations at equivalent sweetness intensity level measurement . Attempts were made to measure the sweetness potencies of two bulk sweeteners and three intense sweeteners using a sucrose sweetener combined method . Three sets of sample combination were evaluated in three independent descriptive analysis testing sessions . One set of sweetener samples had a sucrose equivalent concentration range of 215 wide range condition . The other two sample sets had narrower SEC ranges of 19 for the narrow range low concentration condition and 816 for the narrow range high concentration condition . All samples were evaluated by 10 trained panelists . Reference standards for sweetness intensities were provided during the testing sessions . Overall the predicted sweetness potency measured over the wide concentration range was less accurate than that measured over the narrower range . Additionally the results showed that the sweetness potencies were little affected by the concentration for bulk sweeteners while the sweetness potencies changed dramatically for intense sweeteners . The SSC method was previously proposed for reducing the contextual bias caused by a range frequency effect during sweetness intensity measurement . However the present study has revealed that this method is not completely free from psychological biases and that the accuracy of measuring sweetness potency can be affected by the concentration range over which the panelist is evaluating . Thus the concentration range of sample sets that are evaluated together should be determined carefully to ensure accurate measurement of sweetness .,Sweetness potencies of sweeteners at sucrose equivalent 1 16 were measured. Sweetness potencies of intense sweeteners but not bulk sweeteners changed markedly. Sweetness potency measured over a narrow range was more accurate than wider range.
560,Most marketing strategies for children focus on unhealthy foods and it is less well investigated whether they can also be used to promote healthy foods . Furthermore although it is relevant to know whether marketing strategies perform comparably across cultures few studies include children from different countries . Therefore the primary aim of this explorative study was to explore to what extent packaging colours and claims influence childrens attitudes to vegetable products and whether plate colour influences vegetable intake . The secondary aim was to investigate cultural differences between Indonesia and Denmark . A total of 132 Indonesian and 84 Danish children participated . The study consisted of an,Colours and claims on vegetable packaging and plate colours were investigated. 132 Indonesian and 84 Danish children aged 811years participated. Willingness to eat ask parents to buy recommend to friends liking and attitude. Plate colour did not influence vegetable intake but Danish children ate most. No effects of packaging colour and claims but some cultural differences.
561,The enjoyment of meat and simultaneous disapproval of hurting animals create an ambivalent relationship with meat consumption . Meat eating justification strategies are a means of coping with such cognitive dissonance . We aimed to determine whether the use of such justification strategies to defend meat consumption is linked to the moral evaluation of diverse free range wild and conventional meat production systems . Moreover we endeavoured to assess how these justification strategies are linked to the consumption of meat and consumers willingness to substitute meat with alternatives . An online survey was conducted with 973 participants from Germany to assess meat eating justification strategies moral evaluation of 12 meat production systems frequency of meat consumption as well as WTS meat . All unapologetic justification strategies correlated positively with meat consumption between,Meat eating justification strategies MEJS consist of apologetic and unapologetic strategies. Unapologetic strategies predicted higher moral justifiability of conventional meat production. Unapologetic strategies correlated highly positive with meat consumption frequencies. Unapologetic strategies predicted lower willingness to substitute meat.
562,Studies should be planned with due attention to power and sample size considerations . Abandoning power computations including analyses of the utility of replications is a sure way to reduce the likelihood that an experiment yields insights . This commentary describes how screening for effects with low power leads to biased effect estimates and detrimentally high rates of false findings and why aiming for say 90 power is not enough to ensure that power is on average 90 . It is also suggested that scenario based evaluations of operating characteristics can expose the consequences of power policies . These discussions show that we are easily deceived by low powered studies and that power considerations are crucial for meaningful scientific experimentation .,Operating characteristics of the experimental process can provide key insights. Screening for rare effects with low power leads to bias and many false findings. On average power is lower than target power due to uncertainty in true effect size.
563,Front of Pack health and nutrition labels are intended to help consumers make better food choices but labels that infer a product is healthier than it is have been linked to increased consumption . Three studies were set up to assess whether a products sensory characteristics counteract label generated biases in calorie estimation and portion selection across two product categories soymilk and instant noodles . Participants in Study 1,Front of Pack health and nutrition labels can have counterintuitive effects on eating. Healthier Choice products were incorrectly believed to be lower calorie. Once consumed the sensory experience independently influences food perceptions. More intense taste and texture cues can drive calorie estimations up. When combined portion selection was driven by sensory quality not healthy labels.
564,Consumers around the globe are showing an increasing demand for food products that are perceived as being natural . The present study aimed to assess what properties of wine have an influence on the perceived naturalness of wine with a focus on winemaking techniques . An online survey was conducted in the German speaking part of Switzerland,Wine naturalness was more important to Swiss compared to Australian respondents. An Old World origin aging in barriques or oak corks were perceived as the most natural properties of wine. The addition of sugar sulfites or the use of gelatin were perceived as the most unnatural wine properties. Additives were perceived as significantly less natural than processing aids and technologies.
565,This study examines the moderating effects of perceived communication satisfaction and trust on the intention behaviour gap and the perceived behavioural control behaviour gap in the theory of planned behaviour model using a quantitative research method . A nationwide panel only online survey was conducted resulting in 1011 usable responses from organic food consumers in Australia . Data were analysed statistically using SPSS v.25 and SmartPLS 3 software and the hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares based structural equation modelling technique . The findings confirm that perceived communication satisfaction and trust positively and significantly enhance purchase behaviour and lessen gaps in the intention behaviour and PBC behaviour relationships in the TPB model . This study also validates the TPB model and finds statistically significant results in support of all of its 14 hypotheses . It is the first such study to examine the intervention efficacy or moderating effects of perceived communication satisfaction and trust on the intention behaviour and PBC behaviour gaps in the TPB model . Examining the mediational effect of behavioural intention in the TPB model and including the Australian context are among its other contributions . Organic food producers and marketers aiming for sustained positive changes in consumer behaviour are encouraged to consider the findings and implications of this study .,The intention behaviour and PBC behaviour gaps of the TBP model were addressed. As moderators communication satisfaction and trust increased reported behaviour. Behavioural intention was a significant mediator in the TPB model.
566,This study investigated the association between the home food environment and the consumption frequency of raw and cooked vegetables berries and fruit among 35 year old children and their mothers and fathers . The target group consisted of 35 year old children attending public early childhood education and care and their parents . Cross sectional data were collected from the parents with questionnaires assessing the home food environment children and parents vegetable berry and fruit consumption and food neophobia . Linear mixed effects models and principal component analysis were used to examine the association of parental consumption and the home food environment with childrens vegetable berry and fruit consumption . The results showed low consumption of fruit and vegetables among 35 year old children and their mothers and fathers . Maternal consumption was associated with childrens raw and cooked vegetable berry and fruit consumption whereas paternal consumption was only associated with cooked vegetables . This study identified that home food environment factors influencing childrens consumption habits vary for raw and cooked vegetables berries and fruit .,Raw and cooked vegetables berries and fruit were assessed separately. The consumption of raw vegetables and fruit was the highest. Mothers and childrens consumptions of the four food types associated significantly. Fathers consumption was associated with childrens cooked vegetable consumption. Childrens food neophobia was negatively linked to their cooked vegetable consumption.
567,According to the incentive salience hypothesis framework wanting and liking can be dissociated suggesting that two products having similar liking levels could trigger different wanting behaviors in consumers . Defined as a motivational state that promotes approach toward and consumption of rewarding stimuli wanting can be measured through the Pavlovian instrumental transfer procedure . Having emerged from animal models the PIT procedure aims to measure the effort exerted by an organism to obtain a particular reward . By adapting and optimizing existing human PIT procedures we developed,measures consumers effort mobilization to obtain flavors and fragrances as rewards. measures wanting for a pleasant odor with odorless air as control. discriminates between two fine fragrances from their rewarding properties. Force indicators are more sensitive than squeeze frequency. Implicit wanting analyzed as participants irrational effort.
568,In light of low and stagnating market shares of organic wine there is an ongoing debate about growth potential for organic wine . A recent study revealed that even consumers of organic food did not necessarily purchase organic wine regularly . The aim of this contribution was to analyse the wine preferences of organic food consumers and identify promising new target groups for organic wine . We conducted choice experiments in Germany and analysed the data with mixed logit models and latent class models revealing interesting differences between the results of the two approaches . While the mixed logit models suggested organic was the most important wine attribute the latent class models challenged this proposition . While three of four consumer segments had a strong preference for organic only one segment in the red wine model gave organic highest priority . Just like non organic consumers many organic food consumers seem to use price or country of origin as the most important quality cue for wine . The comparison between the results of the choice experiments and the participants stated normal purchase behaviour suggested there is growth potential for organic wine . Apparently consumers of organic food would buy more organic wine if their preferred type and variety of conventional wine would be available in organic quality at similar price levels .,Organic not the most important wine attribute for most organic food consumers. Different segments have partly opposite preference structures for price and origin. Growth potential for organic wine identified. Comparison of two analysis methods for choice data provides interesting insights.
569,Plant based diets are associated with numerous health benefits but there has been limited work that focuses on diverse populations . The purpose of this study was to determine if encouraging a sample of African American adults located in the Southern United States to dine out at local vegan soul food restaurants helped to decrease perceived barriers and increase perceived benefits and dietary acceptability of a plant based diet more so than being asked to prepare all meals at home . Thirty African American participants mean age 42.812.2years and mean BMI 36.99.0kg m,There is limited nutrition research on plant based diets and African Americans. Short term dietary counseling reduces many barriers to eating plant based foods. Eating out or at home was similar for impacting attitudes toward plant based diets. In just 3weeks a plant based diet resulted in significant weight loss.
570,The Food Disgust Picture Scale is a newly developed picture tool that can be used to conduct cross cultural assessments of food disgust sensitivity . It consists of eight food related pictures which participants rate according to the level of disgust they evoke . Due to the undeniable influence of culture on what individuals consider as disgusting the FDPSs validity across different food cultures is an interesting topic for research . The aim of the present study was to conduct a cross national comparison of the FDPS in Switzerland and China . In total 576 participants were recruited in China and 538 were recruited in Switzerland . The usability and construct validity of the FDPS were compared between the two countries using confirmatory factor analyses . In the current study we present two main findings . First dropping one of the meat related items and thereby reducing the eight item FDPS to seven items improved the model fit in the Chinese and Swiss samples . Furthermore it showed that the scale is a valid tool for the assessment of food disgust sensitivity in China . Second using nested model comparisons the present study has provided support for the models invariance across the two countries .,The FDPS was compared cross nationally between Switzerland and China. The FDPS is a valid tool to be used in Chinese samples. Correlations between the FDPS and the FNS were similar in Switzerland and China.
571,Healthier eating and convenience are two important and often divergent aspects of contemporary diet patterns . With the intention of guiding consumers to make more informed food purchase decisions policy makers such as the European Union emphasize the need to shift dietary patterns toward healthier food by introducing nutritional claims and health claims . The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of NCs and HCs on a healthy food product investigate consumer choices through a discrete choice experiment examine the role of taste as a key food attribute influencing the purchase decision process and explore the visual attention that consumers pay to NCs and HCs . The results from a generalized mixed logit model suggest that there is a relationship between the most highly valued NCs and HCs from the stated preferences and visual attention in terms of fixation count . This relationship affirms that the final product selection is based not only on the type of labeling on the package but also on the visual attention that consumers pay to it . Tasting a healthy food product resulted in negative utility but greater visual attention attached to NCs and HCs and a lower percentage of attribute non attendance .,Consumer utility increases when both NCs and HCs are present on healthy food. Most preferred nutritional and health claims generate higher visual attention. Utility increases when nutritional claims appear with health claims instead of alone. Tasting healthy products produces negative utility for nutritional and health claims. Attribute non attendance is lower after tasting food products.
572,Research has made steps towards the understanding of the main drivers and barriers related to Western consumers acceptance of food with ingredients derived from insects . Nevertheless research has been hampered by the absence of a comprehensive specific and validated instrument for measuring consumer attitudes towards entomophagy . The current study presents a new self report instrument for addressing this issue . The instrument was built upon three conceptual cores which are reflected in the three factors emerged and tested through factor analyses performed on a representative sample of the Danish population and a convenience Italian sample . The first factor represents the negative evaluation of direct entomophagy and is closely connected to disgust . The second factor represents the positive evaluation of direct entomophagy and is closely linked to individuals interest to try novel experiences and to eat novel foods . The third factor addresses indirect entomophagy that is the attitude towards using insects for feeding other animals that are reared for human consumption . Compared to existing measures of disgust and neophobia the new instrument performs better in predicting intention in relation to both direct and indirect entomophagy .,A new measure of attitudes toward entomophagy has been presented. The new self report instrument has been validated on a representative Danish sample. The three factor structure of the instrument shows an excellent fit to the data. A cross validation on an Italian convenience sample fully supports the model. The new scale predicts intention to eat insects better than existing measures.
573,The importance of consumers perceptions and adoption behavior has been recognized in the development of functional food innovation but the issues have not been widely explored in China . This study aimed to examine the effects of carrier benefit and trust in information channel about functional foods on purchase intention as well as the demographic differences of these effects . A survey with 1144 respondents from Mainland China revealed that carriers were more important factors than benefits for perceived attractiveness and purchase intention . Benefits were more positively evaluated when attached to a more attractive carrier . Benefits of improving the bodys natural defense system were most favored by all groups benefits about specific diseases were suitable to tailor for certain groups . Consumers with low educational level were reluctant to functional foods . The improvement of consumer education level does not necessarily increase the consumers purchase intention . Given the Chinese acquaintance society and the jeopardized public trust in food safety the interpersonal channel was the most trusted information channel . However perceived trust in mass media had more remarkable effects in predicting purchase intention toward functional foods the typical products with credence attributes . Trust in mass media negatively interacted with friends recommendation in affecting purchase intention . These findings extend our understanding of how to tailor products for different groups and the effects of information channels on purchase intention .,Carriers are more vital factors than benefits for purchase intention. Functional foods for improving the overall health are suitable for the whole market. Upgrading education level does not necessarily increase purchase intention. Friends recommendation is the most trusted information channel. Mass media have remarkable effects in eliciting purchase intention.
574,Including insect ingredients into familiar food products could be a step in enabling a higher acceptance of insects in Western countries . This study investigates the potential of bakery products containing black soldier fly larvae fat as an ingredient . Sensory and emotional profiling WTP liking and product preference were examined for cakes cookies and waffles by a total of 344 respondents . Each bakery product was formulated with 0 25 and 50 BSF LF as butter substitute . Results showed that BSF LF can replace 25 of butter in these bakery products without changing the overall food experience and liking . In waffles the substitution might even be up to 50 without influencing consumers acceptance . The attributes related to texture and color were hardly affected indicating that this insect fat provides a similar structure and functionality to bakery products as compared with butter . Future research should explore the use of refined BSF LF to reduce off flavors perceived in formulations containing a higher percentage of insect fat .,Potential of black soldier fly larvae fat BSF LF in 3 bakery products was examined. Each bakery product was formulated with 0 25 and 50 BSF LF as butter substitute. BSF LF might replace 25 of butter in bakery products without changing acceptance. BSF LF provides a similar structure and functionality as butter in bakery products.
575,With the use of virtual reality this study investigates the potential for popularity cues to stimulate consumers to choose healthier products within product categories in a supermarket context . Popularity may increase perceived product quality and perceived certainty about that quality . Healthier alternatives within a category often have a taste disadvantage compared to regular counterparts as a result of their trimmed down nutrient profiles . Because consumers are more uncertain about the taste of these light products a popularity cue may have a larger effect on product choice for these options than on the choice for regular products . This hypothesis is tested in an experiment using virtual reality to realistically display a supermarket context . In the main experiment a sample of 300 consumers was asked to shop for specific groceries using existing brands and products . The results demonstrate that consumers are more likely to choose light products when these are combined with a popularity cue . In contrast the popularity cue did not affect choice for the regular alternatives . These results have important implications for research and for public policy makers and food retailers that aim to stimulate healthful consumption .,Light foods are often perceived as healthier but less tasty than regular foods. Consumers are more uncertain about light alternatives. Product popularity can stimulate choice for light alternatives from existing brands. Product popularity does not stimulate choice for regular alternatives. Product popularity is effective in a supermarket context.
576,Retailers aim to supply consumers exclusively with food products that are flawless and therefore impose strict standards that foods have to comply with before deemed qualified for retail . This practice results in large amounts of foods suitable for human consumption to be discarded due to deviation from these standards . In an effort to battle food waste retailers have begun to offer suboptimal food products on price promotion . However consumers reactions to price promotions are not uniform and depend on the significance individuals assign to these promotions based on their own price involvement . An online questionnaire administered to a total sample of 3 114 consumers divided across representative samples of Dutch German Swedish Norwegian and Danish consumers aimed to investigate the effect of five price involvement dimensions Perceived budget constraints and current use of suboptimal foods on consumers intention to purchase these products in the near future . Results indicate that consumers intention to purchase suboptimal foods is influenced by different price involvement dimensions within and across countries . These findings offer evidence that a more nuanced approach to price promotions can increase consumers intentions to purchase suboptimal foods and thus prove an efficient marketing tool that can be used to help reduce food waste . Retailers could benefit from applying price promotions that tap into the price involvement dimensions that increase consumers intentions to purchase suboptimal foods in contrast to the current practice of applying uniform price reductions .,Consumers perception of price promotions depends on their price involvement. Suboptimal foods should be price promoted as value purchases and good deals. Perception of suboptimal food quality is enhanced with frequent purchases. Crude price reductions do not increase purchase intentions for suboptimal foods. Budget constraints do not increase purchase intentions for suboptimal foods.
577,Food scientists and technologists are interested in how sensitive judges and consumers are to changes in product formulations . Numerous approaches to measuring sensitivity have developed at a rapid rate in the last 25years however the evaluation and assessment of sensory tasks is still ongoing . The current study compared the efficiency of four difference tests across three concentrations of orange essence . To determine which of the four tasks had the lowest variance in,Compared variation in replicated performance across four difference tests. Employed A Not A 2 AFC and their reminder versions A Not AR and 2 AFCR . A Not A had higher variability than the other tasks. 2 AFC and 2 AFCR had lower performance that the other tasks. 2 AFC and 2 AFCR had the lowest variation in replicated performance.
578,Sensory and consumer research often focuses more on bottom up than top down influences on consumers perception and acceptance of foods . Yet cognitive processes create and transform incoming sensory information originating from separate senses including olfaction gustation and somatosensation into the perception of flavour . The present paper discusses five cognitive processes that affect human chemosensory perception and responses to food flavours Attention language memory learning and metacognition . It is argued that each of these processes are important in shaping interactions with food via the chemical senses . Attention moderates perception through its distribution across the environment fine tuning it for particular stimuli . Interactions among smells tastes and textures are acquired through learning as are hedonic properties . Language affects food acceptability and preference as does the memory of prior experiences with a food even when they are not at a conscious level of processing . Metacognitive knowledge of personal capabilities indirectly influences the results of sensory evaluations . Future sensory and consumer research should take into account the significant role that these cognitive factors play in processing incoming chemosensory information .,Attentional resources moderate the stimuli that are perceived in the environment. Learning underlies the associations among stimuli necessary for flavor. Both memory and language affect food acceptability and preference. Metacognition influences research through the inclusion of dysosmic participants. Future work should consider cognitive processes that transform flavor information.
579,Texture has an important role in childrens acceptance and rejection of food . However little is known about individual differences in texture preference . The aim of this study was to develop and validate a child friendly tool to explore individual differences in texture preferences in school aged children from six European countries . Six hundred and ten children aged 912years and their parents participated in a cross sectional study . Children completed the Child Food Texture Preference Questionnaire and a Food Neophobia Scale . The CFTPQ consisted in asking children to choose the preferred item within 17 pairs of pictures of food varying in texture hard,We developed a child friendly tool to explore individual differences in texture preferences. The tool was child friendly culturally appropriate and had high test retest reliability. The tool identified country related differences. The tool identified segments of children with different texture preferences hard. soft likers . Hard likers were less neophobic and consumed more healthy food than soft likers.
580,As an extension of the current strategies employed to evaluate new products attributes this research presents a more realistic approach and obtains more accurate results through the combination of real choice experiments and sensory analysis . Two RCEs are carried out to mimic a real shopping scenario before and after experiencing the taste of extra virgin olive oils with a new attribute . Regular EVOO consumers evaluated the products under three different stages,An extended approach combining sensory and real choice experiments is introduced. A shopping scenario with purchase consumption and re purchase stage is created. In the purchase stage consumers form expectations based on quality certification. In the consumption stage preferences change and are based on taste. When taste is part of a purchase process consumers become less sensitive to price.
581,The performance of the recently developed rapid sensory descriptive method Pivot Profile was assessed with a set of 17 Shiraz Syrah red wines using a group of 49 sommeliers and 11 winemakers . The PP results were compared to results from descriptive analysis performed by a trained panel . The PP from the two groups of experts gave similar sample configurations although the terms used differed with one notable difference being less detailed information on wine colour provided by the sommeliers . The data showed that the PP results from the two panels were also closely equivalent to that obtained from descriptive analysis with similar sample space configurations relatively high RV coefficient values and comparable attributes discriminating the samples . PP allowed interpretation of complex terms used by the two groups of experts and gave insight into the major sensory differences discriminating the wines . DA provided better information regarding attributes that differed more subtly among the sample set including bitterness . This study demonstrated for the first time that PP and DA provide similar insights into the sensory properties of products and confirmed that PP with expert panellists allows a rapid understanding of the main sensory differences among samples with some advantages over DA in obtaining a more holistic overview of each sample .,Pivot Profile results remain stable when using judges with different backgrounds. Pivot Profile gives similar but less detailed results than Descriptive Analysis. The Pivot Profile sensory characterization method is efficient and reliable.
582,Feeding time is one of the most important bonding moments between pet owners and their pet . During meal time the pet owner evaluates the visual aspect the texture and the odor of the pet food product . The objective of this pioneer study was to investigate the link between pet food odor and pet owners emotional response through cross cultural research .,Pet owners emotions underlie the differentiation among the odors of dry pet food. Culture modifies pet owners emotions related to the odors of dry pet food. Pet food manufacturers can reinforce their brand through the odor of their products.
583,This paper focuses on Chinese elderlys life satisfaction with food a specific and important domain of Chinese peoples daily life with two purposes first to investigate the relationship between satisfaction with food related life and life satisfaction among Chinese elderly second to segment Chinese elderly based on their beliefs about food health safety freshness and taste and profile them by their life satisfaction satisfaction with food relate life food related goals self rated health status self rated economic status and socio demographic characteristics . Data were collected by personal interviews conducted in Beijing with 452 participants above 60years old from March to May 2018 . The correlation between satisfaction with food related life and life satisfaction in the present study was positive and higher than in other countries . Three distinct segments were identified health and safety concerned hedonic and less health concerned and less safety and somewhat health concerned . The level of satisfaction with food related life of the elderly was the lowest among the health and safety concerned segment neutral in the hedonic and less health concerned segment and highest among the less safety and somewhat health concerned segment . The elderlys food safety belief might play a more dominant role than other food attributes beliefs in their satisfaction with food related life . Eating a healthy diet and eating a safe diet were perceived as the most important food related goals while keeping food expenditure as low as possible was perceived as not important by participants . Implications for how to improve Chinese elderlys satisfaction with food related life and future research were discussed .,Food related life is an important life domain of Chinese elderly. Eating healthy and eating safe are the most important food related goals. Low food prices are not perceived as an important food related goal by participants. Three distinct segments are found based on food attribute beliefs. Beliefs about food safety are most influential for satisfaction with food related life.
584,Two studies were conducted in order to investigate the influence of teaware on consumers subjective ratings of and taste expectations concerning one of the worlds most popular beverages namely tea . In Study 1 100 Chinese participants and 100 participants from the USA viewed online photographs of Chinese brand and British brand green tea presented in either Chinese or British tea sets . The participants then rated their feelings about taste expectations concerning and willingness to pay for each cup of tea . In Study 2 65 Chinese participants also viewed these photos with either a high or low price label for each cup of tea . The results of both studies consistently revealed that the teaware influenced Chinese participants bitterness and astringency ratings concerning their tea expectations whereas no such effects were found for the USA participants . Moreover the teaware also influenced Chinese participants pleasantness ratings of tea when no price information was provided but not when price information was presented . Collectively these findings highlight the influence of the visual appearance of the receptacle on the subjective ratings of and taste expectations concerning tea . These results also compare the influence of product extrinsic and contextual cues on consumers taste expectations .,We examined peoples expectations of tea when presented in different teaware. Teaware influenced expected bitterness and astringency of tea. Teaware also affected pleasantness ratings of tea when there was no price information. Price information affected pleasantness ratings and eliminated teaware effects. Ethnic congruence between products and contextual cues affected product ratings.
585,Many people struggle with the classical choice of eating a mouth watering snack versus a healthier product . One of the reasons behind this is that unhealthier products are appealing for their direct gratification they deliver pleasure . The present research investigates the effect of mental simulation as a relatively new strategy to possibly shift the balance between direct gratification and the consideration of longer term benefits necessary to make healthier choices . Specifically we distinguish between imagining the consumption process versus the outcome of eating a specific product hereafter referred to as mental simulations . In two studies we show that participants under process simulation i.e . imagining the process of eating had a higher desire for the imagined product compared to a control condition but in a choice task between a healthy and an unhealthier product more people chose the,Mental simulation is explored as a strategy to modify desire for food and choice. Process simulation increases desire for the imagined food and leads to unhealthy choice. Outcome simulation increases desire for the imagined food and leads to healthy choice. Valence of the imagined experience is a mechanism of desire for the imagined food. Imagining a food consumption event versus a post consumption event matters.
586,This study provides an experimental exploratory investigation about the role of regional culture and Euclidean distances on the consumers representation of edible insects in Brazil a country with an extensive geographical surface . Seven hundred and eighty participants were recruited on the streets of eight cities from different Brazilian states Manaus in Amazonas Porto Velho in Rondnia Macap in Amap Cuiab in Mato Grosso Aracaju in Sergipe Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro Campinas in So Paulo and Santa Maria in Rio Grande do Sul . These participating cities were considered from their cultural identity differences and geographical distances . Through a continual restricted word association task participants were instructed to promptly verbalize the first five terms that came to their minds when stimulated with the expression food made with edible insects . Following they had to score the valence of each term they produced . The dictionaries produced in each city were compared and classified into groups using the Ellegrds index . Each group presented distinct ways of expression and attitude with respect to the inductive expression . Basically Brazil was divided into two main groups according to their representation of edible insects one consisted by the cities situated near the shore of the Atlantic Ocean which present a cultural formation influenced by the European immigrants and the other comprised the cities from the continental region that have strong cultural influence from the Amerindians . Thus the cultural formation was more decisive to explain the similar representations among the cities than their geographical proximity . Given that to effectively introduce a novel food in a country with varied regional culture the marketing strategy should be focused on the values and beliefs of their culture subgroups instead of a single strategy for the whole country .,The role of regional culture and geographical distances on the representation of edible insect were studied in Brazil. Consumers from eight cities of different states of Brazil and strategically located took part in the study. Ellegrds index was used to identify the proximity distances among different dictionaries of elicited terms. Culture was more incisive than geographical distances on the representation of edible insects.
587,There is a growing trend towards shifting from meat centric to plant forward diets both within industry and society today . It is happening to improve impacts on the environment public health and animal welfare . Aligned with this many new plant based alternatives to traditional meat based foods and diets are being introduced . Research has focused on testing sensory characteristics and appeal with consumers . The current study responds to calls in the literature to extend learning about plant forward foods beyond sensory testing and into consumer acceptance and adoption of these products . The objectives of this study are to examine the nature of consumer response to blending plant based ingredients into traditional meat based foods and to understand the individual lifestyle and motivational differences that influence this response . Data is obtained through an online consumer survey and descriptive and structural equation analyses are employed . Results find that consumer acceptance is influenced greatly by their assessment of plant based foods taste health sustainability cost and novelty . Results also find that assessment is influenced by individual differences in food values and lifestyle including healthy eating and food innovativeness . Contributions to marketing theory include the integration of new constructs with existing theory to establish new relationships that better explain and predict the acceptance of blending plant based ingredients into meat based foods . Understanding consumer context and motivations for adopting these products has important consequences for marketing positioning messaging and promotion .,There is a trend towards shifting from meat centric to plant forward diets. Examines the acceptance of blending plant based ingredients into meat based foods. Consumer acceptance is influenced greatly by their assessment of these foods. Acceptance is also influenced by differences in food values and lifestyle. Assessment mediates the influence of personal values and lifestyle on acceptance. This has important consequences for marketing positioning messaging and promotion.
588,Gamification and serious games have increasingly been used in dietary interventions for children . This review evaluates these game based interventions by examining the following questions Can game based approaches change childrens eating behaviour If yes what game elements are characterised among the effective interventions and What are the potentials of applying game based approaches to improve childrens eating behaviour Medline Scopus and PSYCINFO were used to identify experimental studies . Forty three studies including video or physical games and gamification were identified and presented in four topics according to the study aim and eating behaviour target 1 increase fruit and vegetable intake 2 modify snacking behaviour 3 encourage food exploration and 4 promote healthy eating . Both gamifications and serious games can enhance childrens fruit and vegetable intake and promote healthy eating behaviour by improving their nutritional knowledge and attitudes . They may also encourage childrens food exploration to increase novel food acceptance and reduce picky eating behaviour . However playing snack promoting games significantly increases childrens subsequent snack intake and profound effects were found for unhealthy snacks . As game elements rewards were repeatedly used across studies to incentivise behaviour change . The combination of narrative context feedback progress and challenge was frequently used to motivate and engage children to establish healthy eating behaviour .,A review of gamification and serious games effects on childrens eating behavior. 43 studies incl. physical and video games were identified and presented across 4 behaviours. Fruit and vegetable intake increased and nutrition related knowledge improved. Advergames increased intake of both healthy and unhealthy snacks. Gamification and serious games are promising approaches to healthier eating.
589,Food technologies provide numerous benefits to society and are extensively vetted for safety . However many technological innovations still face high levels of skepticism from consumers . To promote development and use of food technologies it is critical to understand the psychological and neurobiological processes associated with consumer acceptability concerns . The current study uses a neuroscience based approach to understand consumer attitudes and perceptions of risk associated with food technologies and investigate how such attitudes impact consumers processing of information related to food technologies . We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activation while participants processed infographics related to food technology topics . For technology topics perceived as riskier activation was higher in areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex that are associated with decisional uncertainty . In contrast technology topics that were viewed more favorably tended to activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex a region that processes positive affect and subjective value . Moreover for information about hormones the lateral PFC activation was associated with individual differences in resistance to change in risk perception . These results reveal how attitudes and risk perception relate to how the brain processes information about food technologies and how people respond to information about such technologies .,People view foods made with technologies as riskier and less positive. Lateral prefrontal cortex tracks perceptions of risk for food technology topics. Medial prefrontal cortex tracks positive attitudes for food technology topics. Brain activation predicts risk perception and attitude change for hormones and GMOs.
590,Consumer beliefs play an important role in explaining consumer behavior . This exploratory study aims at building an inventory of consumer beliefs about organic food . To reach this objective we conducted a content analysis of online comments about organic food posted on news websites and forums in German speaking countries and the United States . Such user generated content has emerged as an abundant source of insight for consumer research although very little has been exploited in organic food consumption research .,Up to date inventory of organic food beliefs phrased in consumers own terminology. 65 beliefs regarding 4 themes product food system authenticity and production. Belief and theme salience differ between German speaking countries and the US. Face validity of results supports use of online comments as exploratory data source.
591,This study identifies how economic factors like household income and psychological factors like healthism affect the food choice behavioral intent of mothers in Korea . We designed a 2 2 2 stimulus . The participants were Korean mothers raising children in Seoul Korea . Participants were exposed to an advertisement for milk as the utilitarian food and a sweet snack as the hedonic food and then asked for favorability and purchase intention toward each type of food and about participants household income and concerns regarding health . Our study found high income mothers were not influenced by food type but low income mothers were . Lower income mothers were more willing to purchase utilitarian foods than hedonic foods . High healthism mothers did not favor hedonic foods regardless of household income while low healthism high income mothers favored hedonic foods more than low healthism low income mothers . In contrast low healthism mothers did not favor utilitarian foods regardless of their household income while high healthism low income mothers favored utilitarian foods more than high healthism high income mothers . The results of our study may assist the government and marketers to understand how healthism and household income affect food choice behavioral intent .,The effect of healthism and household income on the food choice behavioral intent of mothers in Korea. We designed a 2 type of food sweet snack as hedonic food vs. milk as utilitarian food 2 household income low vs. high 2 healthism low vs. high stimulus. This study found the household income influenced the food choice behavioral intent of mothers in Korea. Also the influence of this economic factor can be controlled by the psychological factor of healthism.
592,This study aimed to perform Temporal Dominance of Sensations by modality combined with a multi intake approach to investigate texture and flavor perception in semi solid products . Trained panelists evaluated fat free strawberry yogurts enriched with functional proteins involving texture modifications . As yogurt is a semi solid product its in mouth residence time is short . A multi intake approach was therefore expected to give more reliable information about the sensory properties perceived by panelists . The two modalities of texture and flavor were analyzed separately to characterize the effect of added proteins . Trials were made according to an experimental design with two factors and three levels each . Different statistical treatments taking or not the temporality of attributes into account were performed on standardized and non standardized data . The implementation of M TDS was essential to highlight differences of flavor perception in addition to the more evident texture modifications . The study of sensory trajectories evidenced that texture modifications induced by the use of different whey proteins slightly modified the perception of flavor and sweetness . The global flavor perception of the samples varied with the number of spoons which particularly impacted the taste attributes . This study highlighted the importance of using M TDS when studying texture and flavor in semi solid products and the relevance of the multi intake approach to characterize flavor perception . This methodology enabled panelists to evidence both marked texture differences and subtler flavor modifications and these useful data were emphasized by combining different statistical treatments .,MTDS combined with multi intake approach allows discrimination of semi solid products. MTDS evidenced texture differences and highlight subtler flavor differences. The multi intake approach had an impact on taste attributes. Sensory trajectories and dominance duration gave complementary results. The modification of the protein content led to an increased sweetness perception.
593,Alcoholic cider is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in the US with consumption increasing many fold in the last decade . This study investigates the cultural differences in characterization of craft and commercial hard ciders between American and Chinese consumers . Two untrained panels assessed their perception of hard cider samples through free multiple sorting and flash profiling . A multiple factor analysis for FMS and General Procrustes Analysis for FP showed that the sensory maps produced by the groups showed some similarity however more variability was evident in the Chinese group . Critically the American group employed more nuanced descriptors for aroma and flavor e.g .,Hard cider was evaluated by Chinese and American panelists using rapid profiling. More and more nuanced terms were generated by American than Chinese panelists.
594,Determining the key parameters driving attention and choice at the point of sale is a challenging task . To address this challenge we performed two studies employing eye tracking as a methodological tool when varying the visual marketing stimuli in a lab experimental setting and in real supermarket shelf and thus facing an important gap in the current body of literature the need to reconcile ET results from lab and field studies .,Two eye tracking studies desktop and supermarket shelf are conducted. Fixation duration number of fixations and the consumer s choice were recorded. Results show that brand and product are leading criteria driving attention and choice. Shopping goal labels brand placement contributed to variation in observed patterns.
595,Assuming that the more a restaurants manager know the preferences of his her clients the greater the chance to maximise the experience of the customers and therefore the revenue of the restaurant . However very little is known about the attributes that influence menu item choice of such customers in a restaurant context and consequently on the relative importance attached to specific attributes shaping the overall appeal of a menu item . Despite the familiarity that consumers have with making menu item choices there exists a significant paucity of academic research exploring the relative importance of attributes that influence menu item selection in a restaurant context .,The most influential attribute on patrons menu item selection is the combination of ingredients. A high social context give a greater relative importance on menu item attributes. Highly food involved patrons place greater importance on menu item attributes.
596,Healthy eating strategies can be based on approach or avoidance . The current research examines whether weight status moderates the effectiveness of approach and avoidance strategies in goal pursuit . Across three studies using an ideal weight goal context I show that approach strategies motivate goal consistent behaviors among people with poor weight status by increasing the perceived attainability of the goal . Avoidance strategies are more motivating among people with good weight status because they decrease the perceived progress toward the goal which increases the perceived need for additional effort in the form of goal consistent behaviors to ensure timely attainment .,Weight status moderates the effectiveness of approach and avoidance strategies. Approach strategies increase healthy behaviors among people with poor weight status. Avoidance strategies increase healthy behaviors among with good weight status. This work supports previous findings of using innate motivations to improve healthy eating.
597,This review critically evaluates the literature documenting the impact of training on peoples perception of beer . In certain circumstances training has been shown to improve peoples ability to match and identify beers and to discriminate between beers and between the distinctive attributes of beer . However a reasonably consistent finding is that the benefits of beer training do not seem to generalise to novel beers . As such training would appear to improve the capacity to label perception and or peoples recognition memory for beers rather than necessarily influencing perception itself . Given how much beer is consumed annually it is surprising that there has not been more published research into the role that training plays in this particular beverage category . Part of the reason for this may relate to the limited role of experts in this field the fact that training is an expensive and time consuming process and it is wrongly assumed that the effects of training are similar across different beverage categories . We suggest that further efforts are therefore required before it will be possible to confidently conclude that training lowers the perceptual thresholds and enhances the perceptual discrimination abilities of beer experts above those of novices .,The influence of perceptual training on peoples abilities to identify and describe beer is reviewed. The consequences of training on the multisensory flavour perception of beer are discussed. There are consistent findings in relation to the influence of training on peoples use of descriptive terms. The findings relating to perceptual abilities are inconsistent.
598,The use of check all that apply questions in product focused consumer research on foods and beverages is now common and the method is known to provide valid sensory product characterisations . Extensive methodological research has been conducted and has supported uptake but understanding of how consumers complete CATA questions is incomplete particularly with regard to their decision to select or not a term to describe the sensory properties of products . The present research was situated within this gap and using open ended questions participants were asked to describe how they perceived a pair of samples with regard to an attribute and link this to CATA term selection . The results obtained for taste and flavour confirmed consumers ability to accurately perform sensory characterisation tasks . In particular it was found that i the great majority of the consumers accurately used the CATA terms for describing the sensory characteristics they perceived in a sample ii when a term was not selected for describing samples the majority of the consumers indicated that the corresponding sensory attribute was not perceived iii when a term was selected for describing only one of the samples in a pair consumers reported to have perceived a difference in attribute intensity between the samples . Thus CATA questions remain a desirable option for sensory product characterisation tasks with consumers but should be selected with thought as they may not always be able to achieve desired sample discrimination due to the binary nature of the responses .,CATA questions are popular in product focused consumer research on foods and beverages. This research investigated CATA questions for sensory product characterisation by consumers. Open ended questions provided insights to consumers decisions to select or not a CATA term. Evidence was obtained of consumers ability to accurately perform sensory characterisation tasks. Increases in stimulus intensity were appropriately captured through higher frequency of term use.
599,Vegetable intake in the U.S continues to be below national recommendations . Strategies include changes in vegetable preparation may improve vegetable preference and intake . This studys objective was to determine the role of using seasonings compared to steaming on vegetable purchase intake liking and intention to pay for larger servings . An observational study was conducted during two 8 week periods at a university caf . Two vegetables were offered each period green beans broccoli carrots cauliflower with options of steamed or seasoned . Surveys contained items regarding demographic previous vegetable choices lunch habits vegetable selected liking frequency of eating this vegetable likelihood of preparing serving size cost and eating frequency at caf . As a result of binomial test there were significantly more SS green beans p 0.001 SS broccoli p 0.02 and SS cauliflower purchased than ST but no significant difference in SS vs ST carrots . Liking evaluations of preparation methods were high across all vegetables with no preference towards SS or ST . All vegetables yielded negligible waste half had 0g waste . Participants were likely to purchase a larger size . Seasoning was associated with more vegetable purchases for three vegetables . Participants liked the preparation method that they chose eating most if not all . Results revealed that increased vegetable intake with larger servings may be possible .,Consumers purchased seasoned more often than steamed for most vegetables. Liking scores of green beans broccoli carrots and cauliflower were high. Male participants were more likely to purchase a seasoned vegetable than females. The majority of participants were likely to purchase a larger size.
600,Olfaction plays a major role in food intake regulation . Losing the sense of smell might therefore affect eating behavior . This study investigated food preferences and intake in individuals suffering from self reported smell loss with an online survey . Members of the Dutch Anosmia Foundation performed the Macronutrient and Taste Preference Ranking Task to measure preference for foods high in fat carbohydrates or protein and low energy foods and for sweet and savory tastes . To assess dietary intake adherence to the Dutch Dietary Guidelines for consumption of vegetables fruit fiber fish saturated fat trans fatty acids salt and alcohol was measured . Results of the DAF participants were compared to local cohort groups . Both the control and DAF participants showed the lowest preference for carbohydrate rich foods and highest preference for low energy foods . Participants suffering from congenital smell loss showed an aberrant pattern with a higher preference for fat . The total adherence score to the Dutch Dietary Guidelines was similar for the control and DAF group but adherence scores for fiber trans fatty acids and alcohol were lower in DAF participants . Overall no major significant differences in food preferences and intake were found for participants who lost their sense of smell during life . Participants suffering from congenital smell loss did show changes in food preferences suggesting they are potentially more taste oriented during eating . Together these results show the importance of tailored advice on dietary intake for this patient group .,Food preferences and intake of patients with smell loss were compared to controls. Participants with acquired smell loss had no major changes in food preferences. Participants with congenital smell loss had more taste oriented preferences. Adherence to dietary guidelines for fiber trans fatty acids and alcohol was lower.
601,Product consumption is a sensory experience that can evoke a wide range of emotional responses and accordingly the emotional component of food consumption has been widely addressed and has appeared in marketing literature with increasing frequency .,We develop an emotion based wine consumer segmentation. Segmentation considers both the valence and arousal of emotions experienced. Four segments emerge. and. The average wine consumer does not exist.
602,Several studies have investigated the associations between personality traits and consumer behavior but little attention has been paid to the role of personality traits in the acceptance of genetically modified food products or knowledge concerning the application of GM technologies . We used a large Norwegian survey to investigate the associations between personality traits knowledge about GM use in agriculture attitudes and willingness to pay to avoid GM foods . Using a random effect interval regression model we found premiums between 19 and 23 to avoid GM soybean oil GM fed salmon and GM salmon . Neuroticism was associated with increased acceptance of GM soybean oil . Conscientiousness was associated with increased acceptance of GM fed and GM salmon and agreeableness was associated with increased aversion against these products . Conscientiousness and agreeableness were also associated with knowledge . Agreeable respondents were less likely to think that genetic modification was applied in Norwegian agriculture and conscientious respondents were more likely to wrongly think so . Attitudes towards naturalness of foods were strongly correlated with increased WTP to avoid GM foods . Current policy restrictions concerning the use of GM technologies are likely to affect the perceived safety of GM foods . Information and more liberal regulations may change attitudes towards GM foods and reduce the resistance against GM technologies over time .,Personality traits influenced preferences for GM soybean oil GM fed and GM salmon. Conscientiousness reduced aversion towards GM fed salmon and GM salmon. Agreeableness increased aversion against GM fed salmon and GM salmon. Agreeableness and conscientiousness were correlated with knowledge. Respondents were less averse of GM fed salmon than GM soybean oil and GM salmon.
603,Food neophobia as a continuous personality trait usually manifests in unwillingness to try or even fear of trying unfamiliar food . The Food Neophobia Scale is a measure designed to assess food neophobia . However few studies have applied the FNS in a Chinese context . Therefore this work aims to formulate and analyze a Chinese version of the FNS using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis with data gathered from a Chinese population . We examined the factor structure reliability and validity of the FNS C by administering it to three samples comprising a total of 1073 healthy Chinese college students . The first sample,The proposed Chinese version of the FNS FNS C performs properly with Chinese college students. The FNS C was found to have good reliability and validity. The FNS C included three factors i.e. Willingness Trust and Pickiness.
604,Coffee is one of the worlds most popular beverages with an estimated four hundred billion cups being consumed each and every year . In this review we investigate just what effect the multisensory atmosphere context has on peoples perception of not to mention their choices concerning coffee . We demonstrate how many different aspects of the environment influence peoples choice of what beverage to drink as well as what they think about the experience . Specifically the visual auditory olfactory and tactile aspects of the environment have all been shown to impact the experience of tasting and drinking coffee . This extensive body of empirical research complements the emerging findings demonstrating the influence of the receptacle in which coffee is consumed . Looking to the future and acknowledging the profound influence of multisensory atmospherics on the experience of beverages it would seem likely that there will be growing interest in optimizing and or personalizing the environment for the kind of multisensory tasting experience that the coffee consumer wishes to have .,Each cup of coffee is consumed in a particular environment. The multisensory atmosphere and context influence coffee perception behaviour. Research concerning the visual auditory olfactory and tactile aspects of the environment reviewed. Latest virtual reality approach to testing the impact of the context evaluated. The impact of coffee aroma on consumer behaviour also evaluated.
605,Front of package labels are recommended to reduce consumer intake of ultra processed food products . The multiple traffic light label is one example of FOPL that indicates the content of target nutrients in products by displaying red amber and or green color coding . The red code may implicitly enhance sweetness perception and approach dispositions toward sweet UPP via cross modal visual taste interactions . We conducted two experiments to examine the possibility of contradictory influence of explicitly learned and implicit cross modal associations on the emotional responses evoked by UPP pictures . In both experiments we first explicitly associated the color codes with health related meanings . In Experiment I a psychometric tool estimated the emotional responses evoked by UPP pictures when preceded by red amber or green color codes . In Experiment II we recorded participants electrocortical brain activity to assess the early posterior negativity component as an index of the emotional responses to UPP . The reported pleasantness and the EPN amplitude were greater for sweet UPP relative to salty UPP when primed with red codes but not when primed with green or amber . A red code increased positive emotions toward sweet UPP despite its explicit association with increased health risks . Thus the use of multiple traffic lights might lead to an unintended implicit approach behavior toward sweet UPP . Designers researchers and policy makers may consider color taste cross modal associations when designing testing and applying FOPL .,A red prime increased pleasantness ratings for sweet ultra processed foods UPP . A red prime increased brains motivational processing toward sweet UPP. Visual taste cross modal associations may trigger approach dispositions toward UPP. Efficacy of red coded front of pack labels might be lower than expected.
606,The understanding of what the consumer considers as craftsmanship is a sensitive question in the food sector . Despite food label regulations on this issue having undergone partial harmonisation revealing what the consumer perceives as a craft food is a feat that has yet to be achieved . Drawing upon a review of literature in the field of consumer research this investigation addresses this knowledge gap . In the light of the Alphabet Theory framework the review offers a systematic overview of the motives affecting individuals perception of food product craftsmanship as well as of the key factors affecting consumer behaviour towards craft foods . The findings provide useful insight to add to the body of extant literature and to discuss the possible directions of research . Moreover the results can also have relevant importance to support legislators in designing appropriate regulations on craft foods .,We reviewed 36 papers considering the consumers perspective. We organised the findings in the context of Alphabet Theory. Attitudes are relevant predictors of craft food products. Price is consistently associated with the perception of quality. Craft food consumption is perceived as a meaningful moment of pleasure resulting from a multifaceted experience. A critical discussion on the possible directions of future research is provided.
607,The aim of the present study was to determine the implicit and explicit responses of consumers when evaluating two apple ciders of the same brand being one of the samples a protected designation of origin product . Samples were tested in blind conditions to determine if liking was different and was driven by the sensory properties . Then brand images were also evaluated by consumers . Finally the products were tested providing consumers with information about the specific cider that they were testing showing the brand images during the test . The first phase of the study was designed to determine the implicit reaction of 52 consumers recorded using biosensors capable of measuring skin conductance variations . For this phase approximately 50 of consumers were familiar with the PDO logo while the other 50 was not aware of the logo significance and was clarified before the test . During the second phase of the study the response of the consumers who were related with the logo significance was further investigated . A total of 65 consumers who were familiar with the PDO significance were recruited and the same samples than in phase I were assessed . Liking as well as emotions using the EsSense25 lexicon were documented . Significant differences were detected in arousal and also in impact between consumers groups . On the contrary when studying the explicit response liking and emotions were not significantly different for both cider samples . Implicit reaction might have indicated additional information which was lost when a rationalized response was provided .,Both implicit and explicit measures were needed to understand consumers response. The extrinsic properties were the drivers of the consumers response. PDO logo familiarity was related with a low emotional activation.
608,Nutritional warnings highlighting high content of nutrients associated with non communicable diseases have been recently proposed as a tool to facilitate the identification of unhealthful products . However several different cues raising positive healthful associations are usually included on food packages which can reduce the effectiveness of nutritional warnings . This study aimed to evaluate the effect of nutritional warnings and claims on the perceived healthfulness of four product categories frequently consumed in Brazil yogurt juice bread and crackers . For each category eight packages were designed following a full factorial experimental design with three two level factors two types of claims and nutritional warnings highlighting high content of saturated fat sugar and or sodium . A total of 820 adults participated in an online survey . They were randomly divided into four groups each of which evaluated the packages of one product category . For each package participants were asked to rate their perceived healthfulness using a 7 point scale 1,The influence of warnings and claims on perceived healthfulness was studied. Warnings had largest relative importance and decreased perceived healthfulness. Most claims increased perceived healthfulness. Consumers willing to compromise pleasure for health gave more importance to warnings. Warnings could override the positive healthful associations generated by claims.
609,Price origin and type of production are all known to influence consumer choices when it comes to fresh food . However the interactions between these factors have received limited attention in the food choice literature . With the growth of online grocery shopping services another under investigated issue is the willingness to buy fresh food products sold online . Our aim was to partially fill these gaps by applying a scenario based methodology . We exposed 324 individuals to 54 scenarios describing a situation in which a character goes to buy apples . The scenarios featured all possible combinations of four within participants factors purchase site origin price and type of production . For each scenario participants rated their WTB for the apples on sale . Analyses conducted on the whole sample showed that consumers WTB was higher for locally grown organic and low priced apples . Furthermore cluster analysis revealed three consumer segments with different behavioral profiles .,Andersons scenario based method can be used to explain consumers trade offs. Willingness to buy apples is influenced by price origin and type of production. In some cases consumers prefer to buy imported apples rather than domestic ones. Price sensitive non online and organic consumer profiles were identified. Organic consumers rejected conventional farming even when the apples were local.
610,Product centric emotion research can deepen understanding of consumers product experiences and food choices . Emotion measurement has become widespread in product research and questionnaires where consumers respond to emotion words are popular and manifold . The present research adds to this multiplicity by presenting a parsimonious single response questionnaire that spans the dimensions of pleasure and arousal and their combinations . These are represented in a circular layout with 12 axes radiating from a central point . Each of the arms represents an emotion domain that is exemplified by two emotion words and consumers task is to select the word pair that best represents how they feel . The questionnaire is informed by a circumplex model of human core affect and methodological aspects relevant for use in applied product research were investigated in 23 consumer studies spanning a very broad range of products and categories . The first of four research questions established that the questionnaire is suitable for use with tasted stimuli written stimuli and image stimuli . Suitability of the questionnaire with New Zealand consumers was confirmed and extended to Chinese consumers who took part in 7 of the 23 studies . Responses obtained using the questionnaire appeared to be repeatable and based on the criterion of the regression vector coefficient being equal to or greater than 0.95 stability could be achieved with as few as 30 consumers despite only obtaining a single response per consumer per stimulus . Finally it was found that the degree of differences between stimuli in a study influenced discrimination which was larger when stimuli were more different . This intuitively made sense and mirrored past research . By capturing the valencearousal space this questionnaire spans more broadly than most emotion word questionnaires for applied and product focused research and a notable feature of the obtained responses was that all were relevant in each of the 23 studies . The results are specific to the tested questionnaire variant and future research is needed to determine its goodness of fit to the underpinning circumplex model . Comparisons with existing product emotion research questionnaires are yet to be performed as is testing of questionnaire variants .,Presents a single response emotion word questionnaire for applied product research. Inspired by a circumplex model of core affect it covers the valencearousal space. Method characterisation with an applied focus across 23 consumer studies. The questionnaire is suitable for use with tasted written and image stimuli. The questionnaire is suitable for use with Chinese consumers. Degree of sample differences influences discrimination and response stability.
611,Cultural and genetic differences in consumer populations across the world are important determinants for food preferences . The present study investigated differences in preferred oral processing behaviors between Chinese Asian and Danish Caucasian consumers and the possible relationship to lingual tactile acuity and the two most well researched phenotypic markers of taste sensitivity such as 6 n propylthiouracil responsiveness and Fungiform Papillae Density .,Asian Chinese and Caucasian Danish populations differed in oral food processing behavior. Asians were characterized by larger numbers of Soft processing likers. Asians and Caucasians were equally sensitive to punctate lingual touch stimulation. Asians had both greater responsiveness to PROP and Fungiform Papillae Density.
612,Nutritional warnings are rapidly gaining relevance particularly in the region of the Americas as a front of package nutrition labelling scheme that facilitate the identification of products with high content of nutrients associated with non communicable diseases . Several graphic designs are being developed as countries discuss the implementation of nutritional warnings which makes it necessary to develop research to evaluate their efficacy . In this context the aim of the present work was to compare the efficacy of a series of nutritional warnings that are being considered by Brazilian national authorities for the country with two of the most studied schemes the guidelines daily amounts and the traffic light system . Two studies were conducted . In the first one visual search was conducted with 62 participants to evaluate the time needed by them to identify the schemes on food labels and to identify whether a product had high nutrient content . In the second study an online survey with 1932 participants was used to evaluate their ability to use FOP nutrition labelling schemes to correctly identify the most healthful product in a set as well as high nutrient content in a product . In addition the influence of FOP nutrition labelling schemes on perceived healthfulness was evaluated . Finally consumers perception of the schemes was gathered using an open ended question . Results confirmed the advantages of nutritional warnings compared to the GDA and the traffic light system to facilitate the identification of products with high content of nutrients associated with NCDs . In addition the use of familiar signs frequently used to convey a warning message outperformed other unfamiliar signs in terms of their ability to facilitate the interpretation of nutrition information . Regarding colour black signs tended to required significantly less time to be detected when included on colour food labels compared to red signs .,Warning signs were compared with the GDA and traffic light systems. GDA showed the worst performance in terms of interpretation of nutritional information. Warnings were the most effective at facilitating the identification of high nutrient content. The use of familiar warning signs improved the efficacy of nutritional warnings.
613,qPODs are novel olfactory delivery systems which allow for sampling of a wide variety of stimulus types . Participants evaluate odors by opening a port at the top of the qPOD and sampling a controlled air stream . Though they are often used in marketing studies their potential use in empirical research has yet to be investigated . We asked participants to smell citral citronellol geraniol PEA nonalactone and vanillin delivered via qPODs and by traditional sniff jars and compared both hedonic and emotional responses . Across four sessions 31 participants evaluated the pleasantness and intensity of each odor in qPODs and sniff jars . Their emotional reactions to the odors were captured with the PANAS at the beginning of each testing session and then again after exposure to each odor . They also completed the newly developed Mood Signature Questionnaire which asks participants to assign a mood to each odor rather than reporting how it makes them feel . Though odors presented in the sniff jars were rated significantly more intense there were no differences between presentation types for perceived pleasantness changes in positive or negative mood following odor exposure or which emotional descriptors participants assigned to the odors . Our results suggest that responses to odor stimuli presented using qPODs are comparable to traditional sniff jars thus establishing the qPOD as a potential new tool for studies employing a range of olfactory stimuli .,Mood following odor presentation was similar when odors were presented in jars and qPODs. Odors were rated as more intense but not more pleasant in qPODs than jars. Mood signatures were consistent for each odorant regardless of presentation type.
614,Well structured stimuli presentation is essential in eye tracking research to test predefined hypotheses reliably and to conduct relevant gazing behavior studies . Several bottom up factors associated with stimuli presentation can influence gazing behavior . However only a small number of scientific papers address these factors in a sensory and consumer science context and thus provide guidance to practitioners . The two presented eye tracking studies on food images aimed at evaluating the effect of the bottom up factors,Product types affected the majority of the eye movement variables. Orientation of stimuli influenced time to first fixation and first fixation duration. Stimulus size influenced fixation and dwell count. Decision time increased over 5 and 6 alternatives.
615,People with an increased motivation for rewarding substances show increased automatic selective attention towards cues that are related to that specific substance . The aim of this study was to explore if overweight and hungry children have an attentional bias for food cues in food advertising . A randomized between subject design was used with 95 children who played an advergame that promoted either energy dense snacks or non food products . Overweight children had a higher gaze duration for the food cues compared to normal weight children . No effects were found of overweight on the attentional bias measurements for the non food cues . Furthermore hungrier children had a higher gaze duration a higher number of fixations and a faster latency of initial fixation on the food cues than less hungry children while we found the opposite results for the non food cues . The findings largely confirm our expectations adding important knowledge about individual susceptibility to food advertisements . Overweight and hungrier children seem to be stronger affected by food advertising than normal weight and less hungry children . This study is the first that examined attentional bias in a food advertisement that is highly comparable to advertisements that are used by food companies thereby increasing the external validity of the findings . The second strength is that the development of an attentional bias for food cues is developing at a young age and it was examined in a real life situation .,This study examines if overweight and hungry children have an attentional bias. Measured in a food advertisement to guarantee ecological validity. Establishing individual susceptibility to food advertising. Overweight and hungrier children seem to be stronger affected by food advertising.
616,Packaging plays an important role on attracting the consumers attention and creating hedonic and sensory expectations which may affect actual product experience . The present study aimed at investigating whether the colour and or shape of design elements of packaging labels would influence sensory and hedonic judgments of specialty coffee by amateur consumers . Participants first evaluated their expectations of coffee acidity and sweetness by looking at the coffee package and subsequently their experience of the same attributes when tasting a cup of coffee in addition to rating their liking and purchase intent . The experiment followed a 22 between subject design for label type and the same coffee was served to all participants . Multivariate analysis of variance was conducted in order to assess main effects of colour and shape of the design elements of the packaging labels as well as interactions on sensory and hedonic ratings . Both colour and shape significantly affected consumers sensory expectations regarding the specialty coffee but they had no significant effect on post tasting sensory ratings . Interactions between colourshape were found to affect the hedonic measures . The coffee associated with the congruent labels received higher liking and purchase intent ratings than the one associated with the incongruent labels . The implications of these results for the design of coffee packaging that convey some functional benefit as well as possible directions for future research are discussed .,The effect of label design colour shape on specialty coffee attributes was assessed. Pre tasting ratings of sweetness and acidity are affected by label design. Label design influences hedonic judgements in congruent and incongruent pairings. It is important to consider labelling that conveys sensory or hedonic benefits.
617,Environmental cues such as the colour of food and dishware have been shown to influence food and drink consumption in adult populations . This proof of concept study investigated whether plate colour could be utilised as a strategy to reduce intake of high energy density snacks and increase intake of low energy density snacks in pre school children . In a between and within subjects design children were randomly assigned to either a control group or intervention group and were provided a snack at nursery on three occasions on differently coloured plates for each snack type . Snack intake colour preference colour association and anthropometrics were recorded for each child . The results showed that there was no effect of group on HED and LED intake . No effect of plate colour on HED or LED snack intake was evident . Combining red and green plates for a chromatic versus achromatic comparison showed that there was no significant effect of chromatic plate on HED and LED intakes . Despite receiving a brief learning intervention the use of plate colour was found in the present study to be an ineffective strategy to control snack food intake in pre school aged children . Rather we suggest that food intake in young children may best be predicted by portion size energy density and eating behaviour traits .,Plate colour did not influence snack intake in this group of pre school children. No significant effect of chromatic vs white plate colour on snack intake was found. Colour association or preferences did not impact intakes from different coloured plates. Pre schoolers may be too young or require repeated exposure for colour associated learning in the context of food consumption. Portion size and eating traits are predictors of snack intake in 35yr olds.
618,While the demand for non alcoholic beer has increased consumers often complain about its inferior sensory characteristics . As expectations mediate the effect of extrinsic product cues on sensory perception we could utilise these cues to improve consumers experience of such products . The current study comprising four repeated measures experiments investigated the role of extrinsic cues in generating sensory and hedonic expectations of beer . A hundred and sixty six beer drinkers viewed realistic beer labels which varied in their colour design labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor in response to which they rated their expectations of bitterness smoothness sweetness refreshment beer colour body and liking . In summary across these four experiments label colour labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor all had significant and replicable effects on consumer expectations . However the size of these effects depended on how explicit or implicit the information of a cue was relative to the presence and specificity of other cues on the label . For example red and brown labels increased expected bitterness 16.58,Label colour sensory descriptor and alcohol content alter sensory expectations. Labelled alcohol content did not affect expected liking. Implicit cues are less effective than explicit cues in eliciting specific expectation.
619,Aromatic characterization is a key element of enhancing ones knowledge of wine . While several studies have investigated the importance of wine expertise in the ability to perform odor related sensory tasks little attention has been paid to the influence of expertise on the semantic categorization of wine odors . To bridge this gap this study aimed to explore the influence of a subjects expertise on the semantic representation of wine odors by means of a free sorting task . For this purpose 156 subjects were recruited . Their level of expertise was measured using a questionnaire and the data analysis revealed four clusters of subjects with a gradual level of expertise . Subjects also performed a sorting task on 96 odor terms . From the number and the size of odor groups formed as well as the additive tree representation and the consensus partition between the terms for each expertise level we observed that all subjects regardless of their experience had largely the same semantic categorization of wine odor attributes which was mainly shaped by the sources of the odorants . It appeared that level of wine expertise played a minor role in creating the semantic representation of wine odors affecting mainly the knowledge of specialized terms .,Ninety six terms of odors used in wine characterization were selected from the literature. A free sorting task was conducted with 156 subjects on the 96 terms. Each subjects expertise was analyzed using a questionnaire. Subjects were clustered by expertise and their sorting patterns were compared using consensus partitions and additive trees.
620,One approach to tackling the imminent sustainability problem of food waste is to sell suboptimal food which otherwise might be wasted . However understanding how the action of buying price reduced suboptimal food is influenced by the fact that the consumer purchases it publicly while observed by others is yet unexplored . The present research investigates which associations consumers form when they see other consumers purchasing suboptimal foods . In an online experimental survey consumers of five European countries checked every word that applied from a set of items that described what choosing a food item told them about an acquaintance they met in the store in terms of his or her traits . The food item was optimal or suboptimal fresh or packaged food and presented with a communication that either underlined a budget saving benefit or a contribution to avoiding food waste . Results show that consumers of suboptimal products are regarded as economic and thrifty as well as frugal and environmentally concerned . The associations with consumers of optimal products are more diverse and include both positive and negative wordings ranging from successful to fussy and inattentive . Consumers own level of environmental concerns and value consciousness explain the degree to which they perceive another consumer to have similar traits revealing that consumers project their own traits on others . Findings imply that stores offering suboptimal food should present and communicate the items in line with the characteristics of the stores target group and that suboptimal food choices can trigger positive associations .,Food waste can be tackled by offering suboptimal food in the store. An online experimental survey tested associations with buyers of suboptimal food. Buyers of suboptimal food are viewed as economic thrifty frugal and environmental. Buyers of optimal food are regarded more heterogeneously. Consumers project their environmental concerns and value consciousness on others.
621,Wine supply in the French market is structured in an intricate system of categories based on origin . There is very little knowledge about consumers understanding of this complex category system and the sensory styles behind these categories . This study investigated how assessors with different level of expertise categorized Beaujolais wines from general to more specific levels of categorization grape variety appellation and,Perceptual categorization is driven by sensory characteristics whatever the expertise level. Conceptual categorization is driven by wine knowledge and experience. Blind tasting could have activated a script in expert memory instead of a prototype. There is an effect of expertise in the vocabulary used to describe the wine groups.
622,Many ambient variables appear to impact amount and duration of food intake as well as taste perception . Two studies were conducted to determine whether changing light intensity has an impact on meal duration and volume as well as sensory and qualitative aspects of tomato soup in an experimental setting . Using a randomized crossover design in study 1 66 participants were served tomato soup twice under dimmed and bright light . In study 2 159 participants were assigned to one of four randomization groups . A 22 design as a group setting was chosen adding a tablecloth as another ambient component . In both studies participants assessed the soups appearance sensory attributes and the overall taste quality and consistency on 100mm visual analog scales . Meal duration and amount were also assessed . In study 1 there were no significant differences in amount duration and sensory attributes between lighting conditions except for the saltiness of the soup which was perceived as saltier under the low light condition . In study 2 participants ate more longer and rated sensory attributes and quality higher when seated with tablecloth . The longest duration highest amount and quality were observed in the dimmed light condition with tablecloth . The tablecloth seemed to have a higher impact on food amount meal duration and overall taste perception than lighting condition . The results suggest that single ambience factors such as lighting might only play a role in food intake and perception in combination with other ambient factors such as decorative aspects .,The influence of lighting on soup intake and taste perception was examined. Study 1 showed no differences in intake and taste in dim vs. bright light. Participants in study 2 ate more and rated the soup as better in dim light with a tablecloth. Ambient environmental factors can influence food intake and taste perception.
623,Lowering dietary intake of sodium is currently an important public health goal and a major driver of food product development . Reducing the salt content of food while maintaining the same structure and sensory quality is however no easy feat . While several strategies for reformulation exist the available literature indicates that their effectiveness is highly product dependent . The present research focused on different salt reduction strategies for potato chips drawing on two studies focusing on young consumers .,Consumer perception of salt reduced potato chips is investigated in two studies. Replacement of up to 30 NaCl is achievable with no or minimal loss of acceptability. Texture smooth vs. wavy not found to affect either liking or perceived saltiness. Results in informed vs blind condition indicated acceptability had a clear cognitive component. The magnitude of the effect of information was contingent on the salt reduction strategy.
624,Nutrition labels sensory experience and consumers preconceived notions about products can affect their purchasing and eating decisions . The proliferation of low calorie and vegan ice creams in supermarkets provides an interesting test case for how health general liking and psychological factors like halo effects and reactance contribute to product choice . In our study 223 participants tasted three cinnamon bun flavored ice cream samples super premium vegan and low calorie . Participants were assigned to one of three conditions . Condition one received no information about the three ice creams . Condition two received photos of the product containers the ingredients and the nutrition labels . Condition three received the same product information as condition two along with a warning about the health consequences of eating too much sugar and fat . After tasting each sample participants rated how much they liked the sample and its perceived healthfulness and then indicated the sample they preferred overall . Participants in all conditions believed that the vegan ice cream was healthier than the super premium ice cream providing evidence of a health halo effect . Participants ranked the super premium ice cream as tasting the best across all conditions . Liking rating was the strongest predictor of overall ice cream preference as indicated by participants preferred ice cream being the super premium . The research findings have implications for nutrition educators and marketers reinforcing that liking is a large driver of product choice that health halos around vegan products exist and that a text health warning does not dissuade people from choosing an indulgent option .,Investigation of taste and health preferences for three different ice cream types. Ice cream choice is primarily driven by taste preferences. Halo effects are present for health ratings of vegan ice cream. Reactance was not noted for ice cream choice. Conflict between taste preferences and health goals.
625,This study investigates antecedents of consumers attitudes and intentions to eating functional foods in a representative sample of Norwegian consumers,Self efficacy is the most important explanatory factor of intentions. Injunctive and descriptive norms are equally important in forming intentions. Attitudes are more strongly associated with consumers utilitarian eating values. The extended model changes the empirical structure of TPB constructs. Extending the model increases its capability in explaining consumer intention.
626,This paper examines how certain speech sounds within a brand name can alter expectations about the products taste . Across two studies we demonstrate that the presence of voiced vs. voiceless obstruents in a chocolates brand name can alter its expected taste as bitter vs. sweet . We propose this is because voiced obstruents are typically of low frequency contain harsh acoustic qualities and evoke negativity . In a third study we extend these findings to show using the Brand Personality Scale that the presence of voiced obstruents makes brand names sound more masculine rugged and tough and less honest charming glamorous wholesome cheerful and sentimental . Research linking consonant sound symbolism and product attributes is sparse . Most research in this field links vowels withproduct attributes sounds with shapes and music with taste attributes . We contribute by extending these findings to voicing and the sweet bitter continuum of the expected taste .,Food brand names containing voiced vs. voiceless obstruents prompt expectations of bitterness vs. sweetness . Study connects voiced vs. voiceless obstruents with a sensory dimension taste . Integrates brand personality framework with sound symbolism.
627,Meat is deeply associated with masculine identity . As such it is unsurprising that women are more likely than men are to become vegetarian . Given the gendered nature of vegetarianism might men and women who become vegetarian express distinct identities around their diets Through two highly powered preregistered studies,This research evaluated psychological differences between vegetarian men and women. Women are more prosocially motivated to follow a vegetarian diet than men are. Women adhere to their vegetarian diet more strictly than men do.
628,Sensory and consumer testing are primary strategies companies use to collect insights about consumer products . However frequently unreliable results from these tests can lead to failed product launches which can have enormous financial and or brand equity consequences . One potential reason is sensory tasks are often deliberately devoid of additional stimulation which reasonably has the possibility to reduce a panelists engagement with the task . Engagement may drive involvement and focus during testing and help generate reliable data . The overall objective of this study was to develop refine and validate an engagement questionnaire a tool to empirically assess varying engagement levels with a task . Prior literature and an exploratory qualitative assessment through an online platform were used to operationalize the dimensionality of engagement and develop a preliminary questionnaire consisting of 54 items covering 7 themes . To assess the effectiveness of the initial item set participants recalled being engaged with a task and answered the preliminary EQ . Results collected underwent an exploratory factor analysis in order to explore the dimensionality and refine the scale by strategically eliminating items . To validate the tool the EQ was distributed following numerous consumer sensory tests that spanned a variety of food and beverage products test lengths number and types of questions . EFA was conducted in Study 3 which resulted in a three factor 10 item model with good reliability . The new model was subsequently validated in two additional consumer sensory studies . Both validation studies produced acceptable to good model fit indices with an RMSEA below 0.07 SRMR below 0.04 both CFI and TLI above 0.95 and good reliability . When tested in a different sensory testing facility the EQ produced acceptable model fit indices and tracked as expected with participants perceived workload collected using the NASA Task Load Index confirming the content and convergent and divergent validity of the instrument . Such an instrument allows for deeper understanding of panelist engagement and its impact on data quality enabling the design of sensory tests capable of generating more reliable data both within the field of food science and beyond .,Engagement as it applies to sensory and consumer testing has been explored and defined. Engagement is composed of active involvement purposeful intent and affective value. The Engagement Questionnaire has been developed and validated with over 1500 consumers. The Engagement Questionnaire is a novel tool to assess panelist engagement during sensory and consumer testing.
629,Product names can be developed to effectively convey specific sensory attributes to the consumer . Most of the previous research on crossmodal correspondences has shown that people selectively associate words with taste attributes . To provide practical insights for naming new products in the food industry it is important to obtain a more nuanced understanding concerning those properties of speech sounds influencing peoples taste expectations . In this study we investigated taste speech sound correspondences by systematically manipulating the vowels and consonants comprising fictitious brand names . Based on the literature on crossmodal correspondences and sound symbolism we investigated which vowels consonants contribute more to the association between speech sounds and tastes . Across three experiments we systematically varied vowels back and affricate consonants stop as well as voiced voiceless consonants voiceless . Japanese participants were presented with brand names and had to evaluate the taste that they expected the product to have . The results revealed that front vowels increased expected sweetness fricative consonants increased expected sweetness voiceless consonants increased expected sweetness sourness . Moreover consonants which were pronounced first in the brand names exerted a greater influence on expected taste than did the vowels . Taken together these findings help advance theoretical foundations in sound taste correspondences research as well as provide practical contributions to the food practitioners to develop predictive product names .,Crossmodal associations between speech sounds and tastes were studied. Front back vowels increased expected sweetness bitterness . Fricative stop consonants increased expected sweetness saltiness bitterness . Voiceless voiced consonants increased expected sweetness sourness saltiness bitterness . Consonants had a greater influence on taste expectations than did vowels.
630,Previous research has consistently demonstrated that organic food is typically seen as healthier . The aim of the present study is to investigate how these health inferences influence taste perceptions of organic food . In Study 1 we show that a neutral food product with an organic label is perceived as more healthy than the same product without such a label . This higher level of perceived healthiness is paired with an improved perceived taste . In Study 2 and 3 we obtain evidence in Dutch and US samples that an organic label increases perceived taste and attractiveness of healthy food . Whereas previous studies have shown general health halo effects of organic labels this perspective can not explain the specific pattern of our results which speaks towards an organic healthy tasty intuition .,A neutral food product with an organic label is perceived as more healthy than the same product without such a label. This higher level of perceived healthiness is paired with an improved perceived taste. An organic label increases perceived taste and attractiveness of healthy but not unhealthy food.
631,Pea protein isolates are promising ingredients to use when designing new plant based foods have interesting functional properties and can serve as alternatives to animal proteins . However their sensory properties must be considered if their use is to be optimized . Indeed pea proteins are often perceived as having a highly persistent bitter astringent or beany flavor which can strongly impact sensory assessments during sample evaluations . Here we proposed an explorative study for the use of an adapted sensory evaluation protocol that could be used by trained panelists to effectively evaluate pea protein based foods . In short we adapted a classical protocol we incorporated relative to reference evaluation and panelists assessed attributes in blocks rather than all at once . We conducted an experiment in which both classical and block protocols were used to evaluate pea protein solutions made with one set of isolates . Similar results were obtained with classical versus block protocol although panelist performance was better with block protocol . Sensitivity to bitterness was also investigated for this limited number of panelists and it was found that high and medium PROP tasters could better discriminate among pea protein solutions .,We developed a new sensory profiling protocol for evaluating pea protein based foods. In this protocol food attributes are evaluated in blocks. Block protocol led to better discrimination among pea protein solutions. Low PROP tasters were less able to discriminate among pea protein solutions.
632,This research supports the cross modal correspondence between the shape of the bottle and consumers perception of sweetness and price using physical measures of beverage bottles . Images that add visual weight to the lower section of a package increase the perception of attributes associated with sweetness . In terms of price the shape of the bottle is informative about its volume which is the cue predictor of price . Through a within subject experiment we evaluated consumers perceptions of sweetness and price for a sample of 15 soft drink bottle silhouettes . These perceptions were correlated with the psychophysical characteristics of the silhouettes . Results reveal that sweetness has a negative correlation with height and the visual weight towards the bottom of the bottle . Instead the price has a positive correlation with the area width height lid and variance of the bottle shape . Practical implications support having a package design that is consistent with product positioning and attributes .,Soft drinks package shapes can communicate product characteristics like its taste and cost. The perceived sweetness of a soft drink can increase by lowering the height of the shape and increasing the area in the lower portion of a bottle. The perceived price of a soft drink can increase by expanding the observed area increasing the variance curves of the shape and having a higher lid.
633,According to nutritional recommendations the majority of us should be eating more leafy greens in order to maintain a healthier and more balanced diet . Yet the overwhelming evidence suggests that despite widespread publicity most people consistently fail to meet the guidelines . This review assesses the multisensory appeal of leafy greens at various stages of the consumer journey from initial purchase in store through presentation in a dish meal and eventual consumption . The review identifies the current limited sensory appeal of leafy greens and highlights a number potential means to enhance their multisensory desirability be it in the store or else on the plate in the bowl in the future . The argument is made that the latter approach likely represents a more promising means of nudging the consumer toward a more balanced and healthy diet than current informational campaigns and or the publicizing of nutritional guidelines .,Leafy salad greens constitute an important component of a healthy balanced diet. However the majority of consumers fail to consume the recommended amount. This may be in part because of their limited sensory appeal. Ways of making leafy greens more multisensorially appealing are reviewed. Packaging labelling in store presentation and plating of leafy greens discussed.
634,Food neophobia has been extensively explored especially in children . However very few studies have compared this food behavior in children from different countries . Considering the clear diversity between European countries in feeding practices and food consumption it is important to deepen the understanding of cross national differences in child FN . The aim of this study was to explore and compare FN in five European countries using a food neophobia scale specifically designed for children . Five hundred and twenty nine children aged 912years were recruited from schools in each country and were asked to complete the Italian Child Food Neophobia Scale which was translated into each respective language . Parents completed a food consumption frequency questionnaire for their child and provided background information . Reliability of the tool was assessed through internal consistency and temporal stability . Total internal consistency was 0.76 . When calculated by country internal consistency was satisfactory for all countries . FN was negatively associated to fruit and vegetable consumption liking of wholegrain biscuits and timing of introduction of semi solid food . There were small but significant cross national differences in FN with British and Swedish children being the most neophobic and significantly higher in FN than Finnish children who were the most neophilic . Results indicate that the tool can be successfully used in all the tested countries with children in the age range of 912years . The tool can be useful to measure the effects of interventions aiming at changing food behaviors such as reducing FN among children .,We compared food neophobia FN across Europe using a child friendly tool. The ICFNS is a robust and efficient tool to measure FN in European young consumers. The tool was able to detect cross national differences in FN. FN is linked to lower consumption of fresh fruits vegetables seeds and nuts and wholegrain products. The tool can be useful in interventions aiming to change FN related behaviors among children.
635,Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a small scale . Nanomaterials have been used extensively in food production and packaging to improve food safety and eating quality . However consumer knowledge of nanotechnology is low and the publics perceptions about its use in foods is poorly understood . This study assessed consumers knowledge and attitudes towards food nanotechnology and measured degree of liking and purchase intent for tasted foods presented as having specific nanotechnology benefits . Participants were 161 young mostly college educated adults . They evaluated samples of fresh cherry tomatoes and chocolate ice cream for overall liking and liking of key attributes using 15 cm line scales . They were informed that the first sample of each food had no nanotechnology but the subsequent samples were produced with nanotechnology materials . For the tomatoes nanoparticles were added to the packaging as an anti microbial or to extend freshness for the ice cream nanoparticles were incorporated into the food matrix to deliver probiotics or reduce icing . In reality no foods were produced with nanotechnology . Participants also completed surveys on their food attitudes and knowledge of nanotechnology . Results showed that all the samples were highly liked regardless of whether they claimed to deliver nanotechnology benefits . In addition most participants were willing to buy the nanotechnology foods the primary reasons being sensory appeal and nanotechnology benefit . These results show that a majority of young educated consumers had positive attitudes towards foods with nanotechnology and were willing to buy them .,Most young adult consumers liked and were willing to buy foods with nanotechnology benefits. The reasons for buying these foods was sensory appeal and nanotechnology benefit. Surveys revealed mostly positive attitudes towards foods with nano ingredients.

639,To understand consumers acceptance and preference in relation to Nutrition and Health Claims on food products and the reasons for their acceptance in an Eastern European country with a weak tradition in NHC and an enormous increase in the number of foods with NHCs in recent years this study aimed to fill a research gap by applying a multi methodological approach combining a survey and conjoint analysis and a focus group . The survey demonstrated that Slovenian consumers in general are moderately doubtful of NHCs . Conjoint analysis showed that when Slovenians choose their breakfast cereals NHCs are more important than whether visual images are present . Visual images convince only the youngest consumers . The study revealed the importance of social perception and trust in the social system for accepting foods with NHCs images . Consumers who did not trust the political and economic system also did not accept foods with NHCs images .,Slovenian consumers in general are moderately doubtful of products bearing NHCs. The trust in the formal authorities and social system are important for accepting foods with NHC images. Consumers who did not trust the social system also did not accept foods with NHC images. There are four groups of consumers regarding the reasons for their non acceptance of NHCs
640,As the free sorting task becomes more common in sensory science methodological research is needed to determine best practices for the test . Previous studies have shown that asking attribute specific analytical questions can bias the answers participants give to later holistic questions in a survey . For the free sorting task this has led researchers to recommend only asking subjects to label or describe groups of products,Methodological research is needed to determine best practices for sorting tasks. Panelists sorted 12 cold brew coffees according to 3 labeling sorting instructions. Instructions to label samples do not affect subjects sorting behavior. Coffees were sorted mainly by roast some panelists used region of origin. Subjects may be instructed to sort and label simultaneously.
641,This study investigated whether the addition of macroparticles or fat can be used to compensate for negative texture sensations in quark . Cellulose beads were added as model microparticles to quark to induce unpleasant gritty sensations . The addition of microparticles to quark significantly increased grittiness and dryness while creaminess and liking decreased . Three strategies were explored to reduce the impact of unpleasant gritty sensations on consumer perception two strategies involved the addition of macroparticles the third one consisted of increasing the fat content of the quark . For all three strategies grittiness caused by microparticles did not significantly decrease when macroparticles or fat were present . Addition of peach gel pieces to quark with microparticles did not increase liking . When granola pieces were added to quark containing microparticles liking increased significantly despite that grittiness was still perceived . Temporal Dominance of Sensations revealed that addition of granola pieces caused prolonged dominance of positive crunchy sensations and minimized dominance of negative gritty sensations . The addition of fat did not lead to a significant increase in liking of quark although when a medium amount of fat was added it also did not decrease liking significantly . This was probably due to an effective hedonic compensation triggered by more positive sensations . We conclude that addition of crunchy granola pieces or fat can be used as strategies to shift and increase dominance of positive and liked attributes leading to an increase of overall liking although negative sensations caused by microparticles are still perceived . This approach could be used to compensate for undesired texture sensations in different types of foods such as high protein foods .,Macroparticles shift consumers dominance minimizing undesired texture sensations. Undesired texture sensations can be compensated by adding particles to foods. Particle addition can increase acceptability of products containing microparticles.
642,It is well known that perceived taste intensity varies greatly among individuals and that several factors including taste phenotypes Sweet Liking Status Thermal Taster Status ethnicity and gender contribute to variation in taste responsiveness although such factors are usually investigated in isolation . This study aimed to investigate the association between different taste pheno genotypes explore whether these taste phenotypes associated with ethnicity and gender and determine the relative effects of the different factors on perceived taste intensity . As analysis of this type of data with ANOVA can be difficult due to confounding factors interactions and small sample sizes in subcategories the use of regression tree analysis as an alternative approach was investigated . To that end two hundred and twenty three volunteers were phenotyped for their PTS SLS and TTS and genotyped for TAS2R38 rs713598 and gustin rs2274333 . They also rated their perceived intensity of five basic taste and metallic solutions on a gLMS scale . No significant association between the three taste phenotypes were found indicating PTS SLS and TTS are independent taste phenotypes . However the results indicated that Asians were not only more likely to be PROP supertasters but also more likely to be thermal tasters or Low Sweet Likers compared to Caucasians . Gender was also significantly associated with SLS where males were more likely to be High Sweet Likers . For perceived taste intensity traditional ANOVA analysis proved to be challenging . The alternative approach using regression trees was shown to be an effective tool to provide a visualised framework to demonstrate the multiple interactions in this dataset . For example ethnicity was the most influencing factor for perceived sour and metallic taste intensity where Asians had heightened response compared to Caucasians . The regression tree analysis also highlighted that the PTS effect was dependent on ethnicity for sour taste and PTS and TTS effect was dependent on ethnicity for metallic taste . This study is the first study to use regression tree analysis to explore variation in taste intensity ratings and demonstrated it can be an effective tool to handle and interpret complex sensory datasets .,Asians were more likely to be PROP supertasters than Caucasians. Asians were more likely to be thermal tasters or Low Sweet Likers than Caucasians. Regression tree analysis is a promising visualisation tool for multiple interactions. Asians had a greater response to sour and metallic tastes than Caucasians.
643,It has been demonstrated previously that the surface textures of product packaging and servingware can impact the perceived taste and mouthfeel of various different foods and beverages . The present study was designed to investigate whether coffee cups with different surface textures would influence the judgment of taste and mouthfeel attributes in specialty coffee by experts and amateur consumers alike . A total of 231 participants were tested in one of the three studies . A preliminary test conducted at a specialty coffee event in Russia indicated that rubbing a swatch of sandpaper whilst drinking coffee influenced perceived body and aftertaste qualities . In the two main studies the participants evaluated a sample of specialty coffee served in either a smooth or a rough ceramic cup . The coffee was rated by the Q graders as tasting significantly more acidic when sampled from the rough cup as opposed to the smooth whereas the amateurs perceived the coffee as being significantly sweeter when tasted from the smooth cup rather than from the rough cup instead . Both Q graders and amateurs judged the aftertaste as significantly dryer when tasted from the rough rather than from the smooth cup . The perception of body was not significantly affected in any of the experiments . These results demonstrate that haptic cues influence the judgment of basic tastes as well as mouthfeel attributes in specialty coffee for both experts and amateur consumers . Such results should be considered by the industry when designing innovative coatings for coffee cups . In addition to innovation though it is important to create cups that convey some functional and or perceptual benefit for the coffee drinking experience .,The effect of cup surface texture on specialty coffee flavour attributes was assessed. Experts and amateurs rated the same coffee from rough or smooth surface cups. Ratings of sweetness acidity and aftertaste were affected by cup texture. It is important to consider designing receptacles to optimize the drinking experience.
644,Decisions about what we eat play a central role in human appetite and energy balance . Measuring food reward and its underlying components of implicit motivation and explicit sensory pleasure is therefore important in understanding which foods are preferred in a given context and at a given moment in time . Among the different methods used to measure food reward the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire is a well established tool that has been widely used in the scientific field for over 10years . The original LFPQ measures explicit liking and implicit wanting for the same visual food stimuli varying along two nutritional dimensions fat and taste . With increasing use of the LFPQ across different cultural and scientific contexts there is a need for a set of recommendations for effective execution as well as cultural and nutritional adaptations of the tool . This paper aims to describe the current status of the LFPQ for researchers new to the methodology and to provide standards of good practice that can be adopted for its cultural adaptation and use in the laboratory or clinic . This paper details procedures for the creation and validation of appropriate food stimuli implementation of the tool for sensitive measures of food reward and interpretation of the main end points of the LFPQ . Following these steps will facilitate comparisons of findings between studies and lead to a better understanding of the role of food reward in human eating behaviour .,The LFPQ is a widely used tool that measures liking and implicit wanting for food. Standards of good practice enable consistency in its adaptation and application. Appropriate food stimuli require both nutritional and perceptual validation. Validation of the task involves demonstration of its sensitivity and reliability. This protocol will improve comparability and quality of data generated by the LFPQ.
645,The free sorting task is increasingly popular as a rapid sensory method to give a global picture of the similarities among samples . Sorting does not require training analysts allows for the easy simultaneous presentation of up to 20 samples and provides stable results with 2530 subjects . However wide use of free sorting is hindered by the current analyses for free sortingfor example DISTATIS and Correspondence Analysiswhich require statistical expertise to conduct and interpret . In this paper a novel alternative analysis is proposed called Sorting Backbone Analysis which is based on tools from network analysis . The similarity data produced from free sorting can represent a weighted network and so a set of network analysis tools can be used to identify groups of products which are significantly similar and to visualize these results clearly and powerfully . SBA is simple and can be implemented with open source software provides interpretations that agree with current methods and produces clear powerful visualizations called graphs which may offer new interpretable insights to sensory scientists . This paper describes the mathematical and statistical background for SBA and applies SBA to four previously published sorting datasets with comparisons to DISTATIS . In each case SBA produces visual results that highlight all of the same features as the standard approach while being easier to interpret and in many cases produces new insights . Therefore SBA specifically and network analysis in general are suggested as new approaches for use in the analysis of sensory similarity data as produced through free sorting and related methods .,Sorting Backbone Analysis SBA is a new method for free sorting task data. SBA applies theories and methods from network analysis to sorting data. Because networks are non spatial metric SBA improves interpretation and visualization. Six existing datasets are analyzed by SBA and results are compared to DISTATIS. Overall SBA behaves comparably to DISTATIS with improved clarity and ease of use.
646,In this paper we test whether the evaluation of food healthiness is affected by tactile surface qualities that are seen but not touched . Furthermore we explored if visually based tactile surface cues influence perception more or less depending on whether they are explicitly or implicitly presented . Participants were shown 3 implicitly and 3 explicitly textured biscuits that were identical apart from the surface texture . The surfaces were either smooth medium or rough and were rated on perceived healthiness . Additionally the biscuits were rated on tastiness likelihood of purchase crunchiness and chewiness aspects that can affect consumer choice outcomes . A pattern emerged whereby implicit surface textures affected perception more than explicit textured surfaces . Specifically perceived product healthiness was greater for medium textured implicit surfaces . Thus it seems that food healthiness is influenced by cross sensory cues . Implicitly rough textures were found to be perceived as crunchier . Determining food properties usually relies on exposing receptors within the mouth to the components of ingested food . However we demonstrate here that properties such as crunchiness also can be dependent on surface texture . The findings can be used to encourage consumers to purchase healthier food products .,We tested if food healthiness is affected by tactile surface qualities. Implicit textures of surface biscuits can be used to influence perceived healthiness. Properties such as crunchiness can be dependent on surface texture.
647,Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and shows a rising trend with the increase of aged . Currently existing intelligent AF detection methods have achieved good results in massive labeled data . However it is time consuming and undesirable to label ECG signals in real applications . Meanwhile due to distribution discrepancy by different testing conditions it is unsatisfied for directly applying trained model to other datasets . Inspired by the domain adaptation techniques this paper proposes a novel Domain Adaptive Residual Network to detect AF of unlabeled datasets with the aid of detection knowledge of labeled dataset . Firstly residual blocks are adopted to extract informative deep features from the ECG signals automatically . Then deep features are fed into feature classifier to acquire final detection result . Further the multi layer multi kernel maximum mean discrepancy is combined into the training process to reduce distribution discrepancy of different domains which imposes constraints on network parameters . Finally the proposed method was evaluated with the data from MIT BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database and 2017 Physionet challenge dataset . The experimental results show that the proposed domain adaptive approach improves the accuracy by 4.50 on average and the F1 score by 4.28 on average using the knowledge of AFDB . Additionally comparison experiment shows that the proposed feature extractor and classifier achieved 98.97 98.75 and 98.84 for the sensitivity specificity and accuracy on the AFDB respectively . Consequently the proposed method is provided with high application potential as a valuable auxiliary tool for clinical AF detection .,A domain adaptive residual network is proposed for atrial fibrillation Detection. It extracts deep features without manual feature extraction and feature selection. The feature extractor and classifier utilize residual block for good performance. The multi kernel maximum mean discrepancy is incorporated in the training process. It improves accuracy by 4.50 on average and the F1 score by 4.28 on average.

650,Diabetes mellitus is a widespread chronic disease and is one of the main causes of death worldwide . In order to improve the quality of life of people with diabetes and reduce the occurrence of complications it is fundamental to prevent glycemic levels from exceeding the physiologic range . With this purpose many works in recent years have been developed to forecast future glycemic trends using machine learning algorithms that exploit the reading of continuous glucose monitoring sensors which gather glycemic data from diabetic patients 24h a day . However their application is limited in practice by the fact that they usually require a large amount of training data and other heterogeneous features gathered from patients . For this reason in this work we present a novel neural network capable of predicting future glycemic levels using only the past glucose values as input while needing a small amount of training data . The model is a jump neural network with the addition of feedback connections from the output to the hidden layer and time delays for each of the input to hidden output to hidden and input to output connections . Experiments were conducted on a private and a public dataset . We evaluated performance in terms of RMSE and of adverse event detection . The proposed model outperforms other methods suited for time series forecasting as well as models for blood glucose level prediction present in the literature .,A novel net named Auto Regressive Time Delayed ARTiDe jump neural network is presented. It is tested on blood glucose levels prediction using 24h of monitoring data. The model exploits a univariate approach reducing the burden of data collection. The model outperforms many multivariate approaches at the state of the art. A thorough overview of glucose levels forecasting is provided.

652,The Emergency Department plays a key role in restoring the health of patients . Ensuring the availability of the ED and achieving rational use of its resources is critical to avoiding ED overcrowding by patients . Given this the critical question is how ED managers can design and select improvement actions that reduce ED overcrowding . Designing and selecting enhancement actions are viewed as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem . Thus this work provides a hybrid MCDM model combining Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Preference Ranking Organization methods to help ED managers design improvement actions and make decisions that reduce ED overcrowding . In the model the role of DEMATEL method is to generate knowledge to support the design of improvement actions from the causal relationships among the criteria governing the management of the patient care and treatment process in ED units . However as EDs have costly resources actions need to be prioritized . Therefore the PROMETHEE II method composes the model to prioritize improvement actions that reduce short term ED overcrowding . The model was validated by applying it in the ED of one of the largest hospitals in the state of Paran Brazil that exclusively serves patients with the Brazilian federal governments single healthcare system . The model was easily understood by the ED managers due to its ease of use and the integration among these managers necessitated by its development and application enriched the discussion of the overcrowding problem faced by the ED .,Criteria governing the Emergency Department ED are identified.

653,Visual relational reasoning is a central component in recent cross modal analysis tasks which aims at reasoning about the visual relationships between objects and their properties . These relationships provide rich semantics and help to enhance the visual representation for improving cross modal learning . Previous works have succeeded in modeling latent visual relationships or rigid categorized visual relationships . However these kinds of methods leave out the problem of ambiguity inherent in the visual relationships because of the diverse relational semantics of different visual appearances . In this work we explore to model the visual relationships by context aware representations based on human prior knowledge . Based on such representations we novelly propose a plug and play visual relational reasoning module to enhance image encoding . Specifically we design an Anisotropic Graph Convolution to utilize the information of relation embeddings and relation directionality between objects for generating relation aware image representations .

Extensive experiments are conducted on,Human prior knowledge facilitates visual relational reasoning. Anisotropic Graph Convolution can generate relation aware image representation. Relational Reasoning module is plug and play.
654,Epileptic seizure onset detection in electroencephalography signals is a challenging task due to the severe variation of seizures . Recently automatic seizure onset detection frameworks fail to fully consider both nonstationary and stochastic characteristics of EEGs in nature which may lead to information default and further produce suboptimal recognition performance consequently . In this work we propose a patient specific seizure onset detection method based on fully exploration of auxiliary supplementary spectraltemporal information in EEG signals . Specifically prior to feature extraction procedure EEG signals are firstly decomposed into 5 groups of coefficients at different levels based on the clinical interest . Representative feature in temporal domain which is a translation of the nonlinear property of EEG signals is then extracted by a combination of principal component analysis and common spatial pattern and multivariate multiscale sample entropy in parallel and dimensionally reduced by a tree based feature selection algorithm . Supplementary information in spectral domain is further explored by the proposed unified maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder . Finally an optimal combination of features above is identified and fed into a series of support vector machine classifiers with a decision fusion module for the intelligent recognition of epileptic EEGs . The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity latency and false detection rate of 97.2 1.10s and 0.64 h respectively on Children Hospital Boston Massachusetts Institute of Technology Scalp EEG Database . Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed unified multi level spectraltemporal feature learning framework in epileptic EEG recognition validating its effectiveness in the automatic patient specific seizure onset detection .,A novel multi level spectraltemporal feature learning framework constructed for EEG seizure onset detection. Auxiliary supplementary spectraltemporal information attained. A public dataset with multiple epileptic patients employed to test robustness. High classification performance obtained.

Multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition is proposed. Adaptive selection strategy and adjustment strategy are designed. Effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical comparisons.
658,Transient identification of condition monitoring data in nuclear reactor is important for system health assessment . Conventionally the operating transients are correlated with the pre designed ones by human operators during operations . However due to necessary conservatism and significant differences between the operating and pre designed transients it has been less effective to manually identify transients that usually contribute to different system degradation modes .

659,Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate a composite image with salient thermal targets and texture information from infrared image and visible image . Existing advanced methods tend to consume high computational cost for a high quality fusion result . In this paper a simple yet effective method is proposed based on structural patch decomposition . A modified gamma function is proposed to weight the mean intensity component to keep the thermal target . An enhanced power function is used to weight the mean removed component to preserve the texture information . Different from general patch level fusion implemented via a sliding window we convert the explicit structural patch decomposition and fusion into an image level mean filtering via a detailed analysis on input images . By this means the computational cost of the proposed method can be largely reduced which is independent of the patch size . Furthermore we analyze the relationship of our method with classic filtering based image decomposition methods . Finally a multi scale implementation of the proposed method is developed to avoid the evident halo and spatial inconsistency artifacts . Extensive experimental results on the public dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more texture information and outperform the state of the art fusion method qualitatively and quantitatively . The code can be downloaded from,We are the first to use structural patch decomposition for infrared and visible image fusion.

660,Subspace clustering aims at discovering the intrinsic structure of data in unsupervised fashion . As ever in most of approaches an affinity matrix is constructed by learning from original data or the corresponding hand crafted feature with some constraints on the self expressive matrix which is then followed by spectral clustering algorithm . Based on successful applications of deep technologies it has become popular to simultaneously accomplish deep feature and self representation learning for subspace clustering . However deep feature and SEM in previous deep methods are lack of precise constraints which is sub optimal to conform with the linear subspace model . To address this we propose an approach namely sparse and low rank regularized deep subspace clustering . In the proposed SLR DSC an end to end framework is proposed by introducing sparse and low rank constraints on deep feature and SEM respectively . The sparse deep feature and low rank regularized SEM implemented via fully connected layers are encouraged to facilitate a more informative affinity matrix . In order to solve the nuclear norm minimization problem a sub gradient computation strategy is utilized to cater to the chain rule . Experiments on the data sets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the competitive unsupervised subspace clustering approaches .,Deep auto encoder is employed to extract the deep features of images. The self expression matrix is regularized using low rankness to construct the affinity matrix. The sparse regularized deep representation of image is obtained to explore the discriminative information. The sub gradient computation is devoted to solving the nuclear norm minimization problem.

662,Observed rating data in Web2.0 applications concerns user attributes and rating scores which explicitly reflects users overall evaluation on events products and various informative items . However the unobservable user preference is critical for personalized services precise marketing accurate advertising etc . In this paper by adopting Bayesian network with a latent variable as the knowledge framework to describe user preference using the latent variable we propose user preference Bayesian network to represent dependence relations among the latent and observed variables . By incorporating the classic expectation maximization algorithm and scoring search idea for learning a BN we focus on UPBN construction from rating data i.e . the learning of probability parameters and graphical structure . To make UPBN fit the rating data we first give the constraints of structure and parameters in terms of inherence dependencies among user preference latent variable and characteristics of EM . Consequently we present a parallel and constraint induced algorithm for UPBN construction based on EM structural EM and Bayesian information criterion .

664,Diagnosis of benignmalignant nodules in the lung on Computed Tomography images is critical for determining tumor level and reducing patient mortality . Deep learning based diagnosis of nodules in lung CT images however is time consuming and less accurate due to redundant structure and the lack of adequate training data . In this paper a novel diagnosis method based on Deep Transfer Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machine is explored which merges the synergy of two algorithms to deal with benignmalignant nodules classification . An optimal DTCNN is first adopted to extract high level features of lung nodules which has been trained with the ImageNet dataset beforehand . After that an ELM classifier is further developed to classify benign and malignant lung nodules . Two datasets including the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative public dataset and a private dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach .

665,Deep neural networks have been widely studied in the field of mechanical fault diagnosis with the rapidity of intelligent manufacturing and industrial big data however attractive performance gains usually come from a premise that source training data and target test data have the same distribution . Unfortunately this assumption is generally untenable in practice due to changeable working conditions and complex industrial environment . To address this issue a double level adversarial domain adaptation network is presented for cross domain fault diagnosis which is able to bridge the divergences between the source and target domains . Specifically the proposed diagnostic framework is composed of a feature extractor based on deep convolutional network a domain discriminator and two label classifiers which conducts two minimax adversarial games . In the first adversarial stream the feature extractor and domain discriminator game with each other to achieve domain level alignment from a global perspective . On the other line the extractor and two classifiers are against each other to conduct class level alignment in which Wasserstein discrepancy is used to detect outlier target samples . As a result the extractor can learn transferable discriminative features for accurate fault diagnosis . Extensive diagnostic experiments are constructed for performance analysis and several state of the art diagnostic methods are selected for comparative study . The comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method .,A double level adversarial domain adaptation network is proposed to bridge the domain distribution differences for intelligent fault diagnosis.

666,Metabolite also known as intermediate metabolite refers to substances produced or consumed in the metabolic processes . There are growing evidences that metabolites play an important role in the study of diseases . Due to the traditional experiments it is time consuming and luxurious to find the associations between metabolite and disease we proposed a computational method called RCNMF to predict metabolite disease associations . Firstly we calculate the disease semantic similarity and the molecular fingerprint similarity of metabolite . The molecular fingerprint similarity of metabolite makes full use of the molecular structure internal information of metabolites . Then we modify the original metabolite disease associations matrix to replace some values of 0 with numbers between 0 and 1 . Finally we use the non negative matrix factorization algorithm to predict potential metabolite disease associations . We adopt the cross validation mechanism to verify the performance of our proposed method . The AUC values of based the Leave one out cross validation measurement and the Five fold cross validation measurement reach 0.9566 and 0.9430 respectively . What is more case studies of common diseases also illustrate the effectiveness of our method . Thus the superior experimental results show that our method can effectively predict the potential disease metabolites associations .,We develop a computational model called RCNMF to predict the metabolite disease association. The molecular structure internal information of metabolite is used to compute the similarity of metabolites. Our method achieves good performance by reducing the sparsity of the association between metabolites and disease.
667,The support vector machine method has been widely used in gear fault diagnosis . SVM is essentially a convex hull based classifier . However using the CH to approximate the class region underestimates the true region which leads to unsatisfactory classification performance of SVM . The use of hyperdisk based classifiers for classification can effectively avoid the above problem . But the compactness or looseness of the HD model is not adjustable and the HD based classifier has poor robustness to outliers . Therefore to achieve better classification results in gear fault diagnosis a classifier based on extensible and displaceable hyperdisk is proposed . By introducing the extensibility factor the EDHD based classifier allows the compactness or looseness of the HD model to be adjusted to better approximate the class region . Besides by introducing the displaceability factor the EDHD based classifier can achieve higher robustness to outliers . Meanwhile to extract features from unstable and nonlinear signals a new entropy called multiscale fuzzy distribution entropy is proposed . Moreover empirical mode decomposition is used to preprocess the original signal before feature extraction and Laplacian Score is used for feature selection after feature extraction . Finally the EDHD and MFDE based gear fault diagnosis method is proposed . The results of gear fault diagnosis experiments fully prove the effectiveness of the proposed method .,Extensible and displaceable hyperdisk based classifier is proposed and applied to gear fault diagnosis. Multiscale fuzzy distribution entropy is proposed for feature extraction in gear fault diagnosis. A gear fault diagnosis method based on extensible and displaceable hyperdisk based classifier is proposed. Comparative experiments with existing methods verify the superiority of the proposed method.

Heterogeneous information kernels is integrated via multiple kernel learning. For HSIC MKL we employ the Laplacian regular term to smooth the weights.
669,Community structure exists in most real world networks such as social networks smart grids and transportation networks . Established approaches for community detection usually depend on some user defined criteria . These criteria based methods usually involve some optimization procedures and need to specify some parameters which are thus time consuming and sensitive to parameters . In this paper inspired by the Mathew effect of human society we view a network as a social system and design a new algorithm called CDME . Relying on the new concept CDME has many desirable properties . It allows uncovering high quality communities driven by dynamic CDME is also parameter free . More importantly since CDME works in a local way and only needs to calculate the attractiveness of neighboring nodes which lend itself to handling large scale networks . Experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets have demonstrated that CDME has many benefits and outperforms many state of the art algorithms .,We consider the problem of community detection from a new viewpoint the Matthew effect. The CDME algorithm has proven to be more efficient and can find high quality communities. The CDME method does not need parameter settings. The CDME algorithm can be applied to large scale networks.
670,Multiple surrogates can be trained in surrogate assisted optimization of expensive problems to describe different characteristics of the real fitness landscape . It has been shown that optimization assisted by multiple surrogate models are beneficial compared to a single surrogate . Along this line of research we propose to train two surrogate models one global surrogate model trained using all available data and the other one local surrogate model trained using only part of the data subsequently selected from the data sorted according to an ascending order of the objective value . Different from most existing multi surrogate based approaches however we adopt the multi tasking optimization framework to accelerate the convergence by regarding the two surrogates as two related tasks . This way two optimal solutions found by the multi tasking algorithm will be evaluated using the real expensive objective function and consequently both the global and local models will be updated . This process repeats until the allowed computational budget is exhausted . Experiments are conducted on twelve widely used benchmark problems of up to 200 dimensions to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm . Our results show that the proposed method is very competitive has quick convergence and scales well with the increase in the number of decision variables for solving computationally expensive single objective optimization problems .,A global model and a local model are used to balance the exploration and exploitation. Two models are regarded as two related tasks and optimized simultaneously. Some best solutions in the archive are used in initialization to speed up the convergence.
671,Human gait is a proven biometric trait with applications in security for authentication and disease diagnosis . However it is one sided to express and interpret gait data from a single point of view which can not reflect multi dimensional characteristics of gait changes . Moreover if the gait pattern observed from other views has pathological or abnormal behavior or has micro movement it is not easy to be detected and thus affects the recognition rate of gait . In addition the multi view fusion of gait knowledge can be challenging due to the close correlation between various visual angles . Owing to the above facts we propose a spiderweb graph neural network to solve the multi view gait recognition problem which connects the gait data of single view with that of other views concurrently and constructs an active graph convolutional neural network . The gait trajectory of each view is analyzed by the combination of a memory module and a capsule module which accomplishes the multi view feature fusion as well as the spatio temporal feature extraction of single view . The experimental results show that the SpiderNet is superior to fifteen state of the art methods such as random forest long short term memory and convolutional neural network and achieves 98.54 98.77 and 96.91 of the results on three challenging gait datasets SDUgait CASIA B and OU MVLP .,A spiderweb graph neural network is built for multi view gait recognition.

The SpiderNet fuses features of various views and outperforms other methods.
672,This paper focuses on the problem of student knowledge diagnosis that is a basic task of realizing personalized education . Most traditional methods rely on the question concept matrix empirically designed by experts . However the expert concepts are expensive and inter overlapping in their constructions leading to ambiguous explanations . With the intuition that each student can master a part of the knowledge involved in all questions in this paper we propose a novel learning based model for student knowledge diagnosis dubbed Meta knowledge Dictionary Learning . MetaDL aims to learn a meta knowledge dictionary from student responses where any knowledge entity is a linear combination of a few atoms in the meta knowledge dictionary . The resultant problem could be effectively solved by developing the alternating direction method of multipliers . This study has three innovations learning independent meta knowledges instead of traditional complex concepts sparely representing knowledge entity instead of densely weighted representation and interpreting expert concepts with the resulting meta knowledges . For evaluation the diagnosis results from metaDL are used to group students and predict responses on two public datasets and a private dataset from our institution . The experiment results show that metaDL delivers an effective student knowledge diagnosis and then results in good performances on the two applications in comparison with other methods .

Given citizens giant but unbalancing riding demand and the very limited taxis in a city dynamic taxi route recommendation is essential for its ability to alleviate the waiting time of passengers and increase the earning of taxi drivers . Thus in this paper we study the dynamic taxi route recommendation problem as a sequential decision making problem and we design an effective two step method to tackle it .,We comprehensively study the spatio temporal features for taxi route recommendation. A deep policy network is carefully designed to fuse the extracted features. An adaptive deep reinforcement learning method is developed to learn the policy net. Evaluation using real world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
674,Relation classification is an important task in natural language processing fields . The goal is to predict predefined relations for the marked nominal pairs in given sentences . State of the art works usually focus on using deep neural networks as classifier to conduct the relation prediction . The rich semantic information of relationships in the triples of existing knowledge graph can be used as additional supervision for relation classification . However these relationships were simply used as labels to specify the class of sentences in previous works and their semantic information was completely ignored . In this paper a novel approach is proposed for relation classification which jointly uses information from textual sentences and knowledge graphs . To this end we introduce a Transformer encoder to measure the semantic similarity between sentences and relation types . Besides we connect the semantic information of marked nominals in sentences with that of the corresponding entities in knowledge graph to generate the semantic matching information between textual relations and KG relations . The matching information can provide additional supervision for relation classification . Since the words and entities are used interactively with each other in our work we propose an embedding translating strategy to handle the semantic gap problem between word embeddings and entity embeddings . Experimental results on two widely used datasets SemEval 2010 Task 8 and TACRED show that our approach is able to efficiently use the semantic information from the knowledge graph to enhance the performance of the Transformer encoder for relation classification .,Proposed a knowledge graph enhanced transformer for relation classification. Proposed an embedding translation model to embed the words and entities. Proposed a triplet embedding model to augment the interaction of triples.
675,In cancer research it is important to classify tissue samples in different classes . Gene selection purpose is to find the minimum number of genes that can predict sample classes with efficacy . This work is focused on the gene selection problem by introducing a new hybrid method . This new method combines a first step of gene filtering with an optimization algorithm in a second step to find the best subset of genes for the classification task . The first step uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process in which five ranking methods are used to select the most relevant genes in the dataset . In this way this gene filtering reduces the number of genes to manage . Regarding the second step the gene selection can be divided into two objectives minimizing the number of selected genes and maximizing the classification accuracy . Therefore we have used a multi objective optimization approach . More exactly an Artificial Bee Colony based on Dominance algorithm has been proposed for this second step . Our approach has been tested with eleven real cancer datasets and the results have been compared with several multi objective methods proposed in the scientific literature . Our results show a high accuracy in the classification task with a small subset of genes . Also to prove the relevance of our proposal a biological analysis has been developed on the genes selected . The conclusions of this biological analysis are positive because the selected genes are closely linked to the cancer dataset they belong to .,A new hybrid method for gene selection has been developed. The method combines AHP based gene filtering SVM and ABCD algorithm. The evaluation has been performed with 11 cancer datasets of 7 types of cancer. Comparisons have been done with 7 multi objective methods from other authors. The biological relevance has been evaluated showing the good results of the proposal.

In 2007 the Aura Landfill was equipped with a landfill gas burning system in a CDM UNFCCC project with reported measured volumes of burned methane gas . These volumes were used to retrieve the methane generation potential,In a large landfill in the Amazon retrieved methane generation rate was 0.25 year. This rate is 47 larger than suggested by the IPCC and 3 times larger than LandGEMs. 48 of the total emission had happened before implementing the gas burning system. 81 of the total methane emission have occured up to the landfills closing date. A total of 9.3 Tg of CO2eq may be released into the atmosphere during its lifetime.
678,A general approach to managing municipal solid waste is by incineration . Unfortunately large amounts of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash is produced in the process with their heavy metals content posing further problems to the environment . One fundamental treatment of MSWI FA heavy metals is called solidification stabilization where MSWI FA is solidified in cement based materials to cap hazardous elements from being released into the environment . Mortar formed from this cement mixed with MSWI FA suffer from decreased compressive strength due to their chloride and sulfate contents . Thus pre treatment of MSWI FA to remove these salts before producing mortar is desirable . This study investigated treating MSWI FA with deionized water 0.01M and 0.1M nitric acid and 0.1M and 0.25M sodium carbonate to remove chloride and sulfate . Physical and chemical structures of treated and untreated MSWI FA was studied to understand the chloride and sulfate removal mechanisms . Treated MSWI FA was used as cement replacement in mortar and the compressive strength was tested . Results suggest that all of the treatment solutions tested in this study can equally remove chloride but sodium carbonate can remove sulfate at the highest extent . In addition mortar with deionized water treated MSWI FA gave the highest compressive strength . Heavy metals leaching was tested by the Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure method with results passing the standard .,Chloride and sulfate removal from municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes using acid base solutions were studied. Basic solutions were better at removing sulfate from contaminated fly ash. DI water as treated solution gave highest efficiency in improving mortar strength. Leaching heavy metals from mortar containing municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes passed the standard.

680,The recycling of waste plastics is of considerable significance with environmental and economic benefits while available separation approaches have been considered as a major bottleneck for its widespread application . Thus we proposed a simple method flotation along with surface modification to separate waste acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride mixtures . Single factor experiment was conducted to determine the critical parameters in surface modification . Surface response methodology using Box Behnken Design was performed to optimize separation performance . The quadratic models were generated to predict the floatability of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and the difference between the floatability of polyvinylchloride and acrylonitrile butadienestyrene . The model was also utilized to determine optimized conditions by desirability approaches . The optimized conditions were concentration 0.18M temperature 75.00C treatment time 11.50min along with stirring rate 200rpm . The efficient separation of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride was achieved yielding recovery of 98.40 and purity of 98.43 . The experimental responses well agreed with predicted values demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction model . The formed hydrophilic groups coated iron oxide and signs of corrosion were confirmed as the major mechanism for the selective surface hydrophilization of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene . Consequently this method is feasible for separation of waste acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride mixtures and can be expected to promote the sustainable recycling of waste plastics .,Ferrate modification was found to be suppressive for the floatability of ABS. The prediction model was generated to optimize the separation performance. Waste ABS and PVC mixtures were efficiently separated under optimized conditions. The hydrophilic groups iron oxide and corrosions were major mechanism.
681,Maximizing resource recovery from waste streams is a critical challenge for municipalities . Utilizing the ultimate analysis and high heat value we investigated the energy recovery and emission characteristics for 252 solid wastes of a diverse range of geographical origins classifications under the thermal waste to energy operation . Given the significance of wastes HHV data we proposed a rapid and cost effective methodology for filling the gaps in the experimental data by prediction of the missing or uncertain wastes HHV . We further employed wastes nitrogen and sulphur contents to assess their atmospheric emissions . The results from this analysis show the highest energy content belonged to plastic waste but higher levels of air pollution could be emitted during thermal energy recovery of sewage sludge rubber and textile wastes . Also we demonstrated more significant potential for recovering energy from plastic wood and paper wastes while emitting less nitrogen and sulphur compounds to the atmosphere . Finally our presented HHV models outperform concerning generalizability validity and accuracy when comparing the obtained results to those of previously published models . The results from this present study are particularly advantageous in designing sustainable thermal waste to energy systems to facilitate cities transition into a circular economy .,A rapid and cost effective approach for accurate modeling of HHV is proposed. 252 experimental MSW data from a diverse geographical origins are utilized. Our proposed HHV models outperform the accuracy of the previous studies.
682,The re use of waste materials by application to land is an increasingly common practice around the world but where municipal solid waste materials are applied it is almost inevitable that physical contaminants such as glass and plastic will be added to the soil . In many jurisdictions there are prescribed limits for the amounts of physical contaminants that may be present in these materials but there is little information on whether these limits safeguard soil functional condition . Here physical contamination of soil is described after varying rates of a mixed waste organic output and garden waste compost were incorporated into field plots . At application rates of 100 and 200t ha both treatments resulted in a coarsening of the topsoil particle size distribution but only in the MWOO treated soils were physical contaminants largely responsible for this . The physical contaminant particles present were found only to the depth of cultivation and included glass rigid and film plastics and synthetic fibres . These contaminants were most commonly observed in the gravel and coarse sand sized fractions and in those soils treated with the highest rates of MWOO application . Physical contaminant particles acted as both enveloping and nucleating agents for mineral grains and organic matter and blocked some pores . Although soil physical condition is usually improved by the incorporation of organic matter the extent of pore blockage evident here suggests that soil physical functions such as water percolation may be affected as the organic matter is broken down and the soil undergoes natural re consolidation .,Application of municipal solid waste compost to land coarsens the topsoil. Plastic and glass contaminants envelop and nucleate soil mineral grains. Microplastics block pore space in the soil threatening water percolation.

685,Over the past few years supercritical water oxidation has shown great potential for application to landfill leachate treatment providing substantial organic matter degradation in terms of biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon . However the conversion of ammonia which is present at high concentrations in leachates is the rate limiting step during ScWO and usually requires large amounts of oxidants the addition of catalysts or severe operating conditions . Aiming at proposing a treatment system that effectively removes both organic matter and ammonia from leachate this paper evaluates the intensification of the ScWO process through ion exchange with zeolite . Thus ScWO was operated under a pressure of 23MPa at 600 and 700C without the addition of oxidants . The zeolite was used without any modification inside a glass column . The ScWO zeolite system removed 90 ammoniacal nitrogen NH,Ion exchange was applied to ScWO as a subsequent step for ammonia removal. ScWO was operated without the addition of oxidants or supplementary substances. The effect of temperature and recycling on ScWO reactor were evaluated. ScWO ion exchange system reduced 81 of TOC and 90 of NH. N. ScWO ion exchange system removed color and turbidity effectively 98 .
686,The increasing use of forest biomass as a fuel for power plants due to environmental concerns will certainly increase the amount of woody biomass ash produced . Because of the environmental problems derived from woody biomass ash disposal an important aspect for the sustainable development of the energy sector is the implementation of effective ash management strategies . The purpose of this study is to assess the environmental impacts of woody biomass ash landfarming for soil amelioration through a Life Cycle Assessment . The baseline scenario corresponds to the current most common practice of woody biomass ash management and two different landfarming alternatives were assessed liming and fertilisation . Credits were given to the system due to the substitution of three traditional liming products and five traditional fertilisers . Woody biomass ash landfarming presented satisfactory performance in five impact categories under study in comparison to landfilling . When woody biomass ash was used for liming the environmental savings were more pronounced when substituting hydrated lime . For potassium supply the substitution of potassium nitrate by woody biomass ash presented the best environmental performance while for phosphorus supply the environmental savings were more pronounced substituting single superphosphate . However in four impact categories the environmental impacts of ash landfarming exceeded the impacts of ash landfilling due to the emission to soil of nutrients and trace elements to soil . But this does not necessarily imply increased risks for the environment as the potential pollutants leaching depends on their bioavailability in the soil .,The valorisation of woody biomass ash for soil amelioration was assessed. Life cycle assessment was used to assess the potential environmental impacts. Ash landfarming had a lower impact than ash landfilling for most impact categories. The impacts in human health showed that ash landfarming may not be a safe practice.

The main causes of loss were exceeding volume in purchases storage without refrigeration and careless handling by consumers and vendors . Strategies to reduce losses included price reduction donation practices and consumption by sellers . The study indicates the need for improvements both in the infrastructure and in the hygienic care management and post harvest conservation of the fruits and vegetables .,The losses of fruits and vegetables were high nearly 10tons week. Methods of inadequate handling and storage were observed in all stages. There was a lack of institutional measures to reduce losses.

690,Goal of the work was to compare the respiration activities as measured via oxygen consumption with three different organic waste stability methods so that to propose the optimal one . The novelty of the work is that there exists no comparison of solid phase with liquid phase stability assessment techniques in the literature . The respiration activities were assessed using two solid phase methods and a manometric liquid phase method performed on twenty seven organic substrates . The methods rely on measuring oxygen consumption via pressure drops or via direct O,A liquid phase stability test MANLIQ was compared to 2 solid phase stability tests. The respiration indices order was Dynamic MANLIQStatic. The strongest correlation was between the liquid and the static solid phase indices. The ratio of the liquid indices to the static solid phase indices was 1.62.7. The solid phase tests should be preferred over the liquid test to assess stability.
691,At present in Europe 18 million tonnes of MSWI Bottom Ash is annually stockpiled or used in low grade applications . Therefore alternative applications such as aggregate or as a cement component in concrete are stimulated . Physical and chemical characteristics remaining after treatment however prevent its extensive application in building materials . Hence knowledge is needed on the distinct properties of the material classes making up a heterogeneous BA enabling the assessment of its characteristics and the resulting applicability . Furthermore a user friendly composition assessment procedure is necessary to evaluate the output of physical treatment processes . Crushing is a commonly applied treatment and its effect on the material classes comprising BA is still unknown . In this paper the latter are identified and classified into slag magnetic slag glass refractory metals and unburned material classes . The individual characteristics of each material class are identified and a suitable tracer for tracking these classes in heterogeneous samples is defined . Furthermore a fast method to quantify the distribution of material classes based just on the oxide composition is developed and applied to approximate the changes in the configuration of BA through crushing . It is concluded that although the jaw crushing of BA results in a more homogeneous distribution beneficiation of material classes occurs and selective crushing is possible in order to improve the quality of the BA and therefore its subsequent application .,Distinct physical and chemical properties of MSWI BA classes were determined. Magnetic separation of ferrous containing slag is suggested for beneficiation. The proposed model enables the calculation of a MSWI BA class composition. The behaviour of MSWI BA classes during crushing was determined using the model. Selective crushing of MSWI BA is found applicable for material class beneficiation.

693,With the rapid development of photovoltaic industry the recycling of waste solar photovoltaic panels is becoming a critical and global challenge . Considering PV panels recycling is significantly effective and worthwhile to save natural resources and reduce the cost of production how to selectively recycle valuable components of PV panels is the hot and dominant topic . Different from current mechanical crushing heat treatment and chemical operation processes novel and environment friendly recycling approaches by using high voltage pulse discharge in water called high voltage fragmentation was discussed under different discharge conditions . The results showed that discharging across surface and interior of PV panels produced ablation round holes sputter metal particles and dendritic channels . The average particle size decreased with the ascent of pulse number and voltage amplitude . Considering the energy consumption the optimal condition of HVF in this paper was 160kV for 300 pulses with the energy consumption of 192.99J g crushing the PV panels into particles of 4.1mm in average . More particle was distributed among the 0.12mm size fractions as the energy increased . Selective fragmented products such as Cu Al Pb Ag and Sn are concentrated on the fractions under 1mm . Finally hybrid crushing energy consumption model combined with fractal theory was discussed which presented close relationship between energy and average particle size . Walkers model,Discharge channels are divided into dendritic discharge marks and ablation holes. The effects of pulse voltage and pulse number on fragmentation are investigated. Size energy relationship in HVF process was established for the first time.
694,Waste collection is associated with various health symptoms . The aims of this study were to obtain knowledge about exposure to bacteria fungi and endotoxin during waste collection and to study whether it is possible to reduce the exposures and the total inflammatory potential of those exposures through simple interventions . The study was performed with an initial baseline exposure assessment a second assessment with intervention workers only and a third with intervention and reference workers . Motivating workers to reduce exposure through simple interventions improved hand and truck cab hygiene but only slightly reduced personal exposure to airborne bioaerosols . Exposure can be reduced by only using trucks with high loading height .,Exposure to bioaerosols was highest during collection of household waste. Implementation of truck cab hygiene reduced concentrations of fungi. Hand hygiene was improved by making hand sanitizer available. Implementation of interventions reduced the inflammatory potential of exposures. Low waste loading height caused the highest exposure to bioaerosols.
695,Recycling solid waste not only produces environmental and health benefits but also generates economic benefit . This paper empirically evaluates the employment impact of Florida county recycling programs from 2000 through 2011 applying a fixed effects regression model . The results indicate that a one percentage point increase of county recycling rate leads to a 0.4 job growth in overall solid waste and recycling industry . However the impact of recycling programs on green jobs are not uniform across the recycling subsectors the effect is concentrated in the recycling processing sector while the solid waste collection sector and scrap materials businesses are unlikely to be influenced by countys recycling performance .,Solid waste management presents a policy venue of green economic development. There is a 0.4 SWMR employment growth upon a 1 point recycling rate increase. Presence of strong environmental groups influences SWMR employment growth. Labor force and unemployment rate result in scrap materials business growth. Popular tourist destinations attract more recycling processing jobs in Florida.
696,Preparation for reuse is a fundamental waste management practice that is second only to prevention in the waste hierarchy . The paper building on advertising literature investigates how to leverage the pro social nature of this option for giving products that have become waste a second life . To examine how advertising strategies based on emotional functional or combined stimuli can be used to increase intention to buy these items we carried out an experiment on 507 actual visitors a PfR items shop run by a social cooperative in Northern Italy . We found that depending on consumers social involvement both emotional and functional stimuli based on the social impact of preparation for reuse tend to outperform functional stimuli and have a positive impact on brand attitudes by shaping attitudes to advertisements . Purchasing behaviour has a positive impact on attitudes toward the PfR organization and moderates the effect of emotional and combines stimuli on attitudes toward the advertisement . Since emotional stimuli can be freely used by both legitimated and opportunistic companies the former should seek to preserve their value proposition by making it easier for consumers to recognise actually trustworthy organizations . This is possible combining the use of advertisements with the development of solid customer relationships . To this end awareness campaigns closer relationships with stakeholders and third party verifiable standards and certifications should be considered to reduce the risk of social washing in the current second hand market context .,Sustainability of preparation for reuse PfR depends on actual market performance. Emotional and combined stimuli outperform functional ones. Functional stimuli require deeper trust and understanding of PfR activities. Social involvement moderates the effects of emotional and combined stimuli. Policies are required to reduce the risk of unfair competition and social washing.

698,The combination of increased maritime transportation and the sensitivity of the Baltic Sea makes it necessary to establish efficient eco friendly and profitable ship generated waste management strategies . This study aims to identify best management practices for ship generated nutrient rich organic wastes i.e . food waste and sewage on the Baltic Sea . Ship generated waste quantities and characteristics maritime waste regulations and disposal methods are reviewed and discussed according to the available literature for the Ports of Helsinki Stockholm Tallinn and Copenhagen Malm which are the most important and busiest ports on the Baltic Sea . Sorting onboard and separation of food waste from other waste sources such as sewage and grey water is a suitable solution that facilitates further treatment . However this procedure demands special facilities and sufficient storage space . Aforementioned food waste can be delivered to port reception facilities and used to produce biogas at land . However currently only food waste from ships operating in the EU may be used as input for biogas production not international food waste . Grinding of food waste and discharge into the sea is still common practice . In addition shipping companies can choose buffet type restaurants in order to reduce food waste generation . Grey wastewater is generally discharged into the sea whereas sewage needs to be treated on board before discharge or delivered to PRFs for treatment . New MARPOL regulations for passenger ships on the Baltic Sea require advanced treatment of pollutant nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus before sewage discharge in order to combat eutrophication of this sensitive area .,Ship generated food waste and sewage cause eutrophication of the Baltic Sea. Best management practices for handling these waste sources have been identified. Onboard waste sorting can facilitate future treatment. Domestic ship generated food waste can be valorized at land through biomethanation. Advanced sewage treatment including nutrient removal is obliged on the Baltic Sea.
699,Pretreatment processes substantially modify the organic composition of landfill leachate which affect the fouling behavior in the post treatment of membrane filtration . In this study the changes in the chemical composition of stabilized landfill leachate upon various pretreatments which encompassed coagulation flocculation ion exchange resins granular activated carbon adsorption and their combinations were tracked via excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis and the membrane fouling potentials were assessed in the subsequent processes of nanofiltration . Fluorescence components fulvic like protein like and humic like were identified and validated using EEM PARAFAC . MIEX and C F pretreatments were not effective to remove C1 and C2 which were associated with relatively small sized and hydrophilic molecules . GAC adsorption did not show any preference with the removal towards different components . These differences in the chemical heterogeneity among the variously pretreated leachates led to the discrepancies in membrane fluxes at a similar leachate concentration . The result also signified the importance of probing the chemical composition of pretreated leachate for the optimization of the post membrane filtration . The sum of C2 and C3 in the pretreated leachate showed a good correlation with reversible membrane fouling resistance while C1 was highly correlated with irreversible membrane resistance . These findings provided a new insight into the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for tracking the changes in the membrane fouling potential of stabilized landfill leachate after various pretreatments .,Removal extent was different depending on fluorescent components. Pretreatment using different options led to dissimilar membrane fluxes in NF. Tryptophan and humic like components are small and large molecules respectively. Fluorescent components can be suggested as the surrogates for membrane foulants.

704,Waste printed circuit boards contain a large amount of brominated epoxy resins which may cause environmental problems . However BERs degradation under mild conditions is challenging due to the good thermal and chemical stabilities of BERs . This study proposes a mild and efficient method that uses subcritical acetic acid to decompose BERs . BERs swell quickly at 200C and are thoroughly decomposed into bisphenol A and phenol at 220C when the acetic acid mass concentration and holding time are fixed at 49.90 and 1h respectively . Experimental results show that subcritical acetic acid has excellent swelling and catalytic degradation effects on BERs . The quick swelling of BERs allows the free migration of the catalyst in the epoxy network and thus significantly enhances the catalytic degradation effect . Therefore BERs can be thoroughly decomposed by subcritical acetic acid under mild conditions . Temperature and acetic acid concentration are the major parameters that control the resin degradation rate . Bromine free oil phase products are obtained at 240C . The possible decomposition pathway of BERs in subcritical acetic acid is also investigated . Most of the bromine is transformed into HBr and enriched in the aqueous phase . In conclusion the proposed mild method could be used as a novel practical and industrial procedure for the degradation and debromination of BERs .,This work provides a mild and efficient process for the degradation of BERs. Acetic acid has excellent swelling and catalytic degradation effects on BERs. Swelling phenomenon can significantly enhance the catalytic degradation effect. BERs can be thoroughly decomposed by subcritical acetic acid at 220C in 1h. Br free oil phase products with high added value could be obtained.
705,This research was motivated by the intriguing phenomena across several economies that green building clients developers are observably lukewarm in pursuing construction waste management . Recent studies most of them in a qualitative nature reported that to obtain CWM related credits is costlier than obtaining credits from other green building aspects such as sites lighting and so on . Yet there is a clear lack of empirical analysis of such cost implications with a view to providing convincing explanation to the phenomena . This research aims to identify the cost implications of achieving CWM related credits as stipulated in green building rating tools by focusing in Hong Kong . The costs for using materials required for green certification were calculated and compared against conventional materials by introducing a life cycle perspective . It is discovered that to obtain the CWM related credits one needs to pay a higher cost ranging from 0.4 to 6 .,Construction Waste Management CWM credits are least sought out in green buildings. To obtain CWM credits one needs to pay a higher cost ranging from 0.4 to 6. The number of credits and weightage allocated for the CWM related credits are lower.
706,Compost based biofiltration is a method widely used to mitigate ammonia emissions during composting . To improve the efficiency of a composting biofiltration system it is necessary to determine the most effective degree of composting at which to process the packing media used in the biofiltration system . In this study materials pre composted for 20 and 30 d and mature compost that had been treated for 60 d were applied as biofilter media to remove ammonia from dairy manure composting exhaust gases . A comparison of the results revealed that the C30 biofilter not only completely removed ammonia but also produced the least nitrogen loss . The C20 biofilter exhibited an inferior performance indicating that enough pre composted time is necessary for material used as the packing media . Though the CM biofilter displayed good performance with regard to ammonia removal it had a high nitrogen loss . A spearman rank correlation matrix revealed that the abundance of nitrogen cycle genes including,Minimize NH. emission from dairy manure composting process by biofiltration. Comparative use of pre composted material and mature compost as biofilter media. 30days pre composted material resulted in best biofiltration performance. Complete removal of NH. and very low N loss of 1.84 in biofiltration system. Biological nitrification guaranteed efficient NH. removal and N conservation.
707,Tourism contributes substantially to municipal solid waste generation yet the waste from tourism systematically remains hidden behind residential waste flows . As a result municipal fees are set without precise information about waste producers contributions causing budget imbalances and cross subsidies between residential and economic activities . To estimate tourisms contribution to mixed waste generation in an island destination socio demographic economic and disposal related factors are modelled using municipal panel data from 2004 to 2015 for Tenerife . In contrast to previous studies a mixed demand supply approach is adopted to estimate the contribution of main tourism activities to mixed waste generation thus differentiating between tourists and residents contributions . An auxiliary model is used to isolate employment levels in tourism activities attributable to residents consumption and to capture tourists and residents mobility on the island . Estimates show that main tourism activities generate 0.40kg of mixed waste per tourist daily while residential and economic sectors account for 1.19kg per resident daily . This tourism contribution is significantly lower compared to other studies as it captures tourisms contribution to mixed waste generation attributable only to tourists following a mixed demand supply approach . These results shift impacts from tourists to main tourism activities which highlights the choices made by producers rather than the final customers and reinforces the producers extended responsibility principle . The implementation of a Pay As You Throw tariff for mixed waste is discussed as a way of promoting waste prevention and recycling as well as avoiding cross subsidies among waste producers and as a result imbalances in municipal budgets .,Island destinations are ideal to study the impact of tourism on MSW generation. A demand supply approach gives precise estimates of tourism contribution to MSW. A demand supply approach considers the residents consumption in tourism activities. Accommodation and Food and Beverages are the main tourism activities generating MSW.
708,Indium is one of the components with great recycling value in waste LCDs . Degradation of organic materials and the remain of indium in the solid phase can be simultaneously achieved by hydrothermal pretreatment via parameter regulation . Indium was transferred from the solid phase to the liquid phase by using sulfuric acid after hydrothermal pretreatment . Di phosphoric acid diluted by sulfonated kerosene and hydrochloric acid were used as extractant and stripping agent respectively to purify and concentrate indium from acidic leaching solution . The results indicated that the leaching yield of indium reached 100 under the optimal condition of reaction time of 40min reaction temperature of 7080C acid concentration of 0.5M and solid liquid ratio of 1 2 g mL . Given conditions of extraction time of 3min at the organic phase to aqueous phase ratio of 1 10 by 20 D2EHPA and stripping time of 10min at the ratio of 10 1 by 4M HCl the recovery efficiency of indium reached 97.25 . In addition acid leaching process did not change the surface topography and molecular structure of glass substrate and had no negative effect on subsequent recycling of glass . The kinetic equation of leaching yield and reaction time at the temperature of 80C is 1,Indium can be recycled from waste LCD panel by an integrated recovery process. Indium recovery includes leaching and purification after hydrothermal pretreatment. Acid leaching under optimal conditions can achieve 100 leaching yield of indium. Recovery efficiency of indium reaches 97.25 under optimal purification parameters. The integrated process of indium recovery does not affect glass recovery.
709,Almost 500 municipal solid waste incineration plants in the EU Norway and Switzerland generate about 17.6 Mt a of incinerator bottom ash . IBA contains minerals and metals . Metals are mostly separated and sold to the scrap market and minerals are either disposed of in landfills or utilised in the construction sector . Since there is no uniform regulation for IBA utilisation at EU level countries developed own rules with varying requirements for utilisation . As a result from a cooperation network between European experts an up to date overview of documents regulating IBA utilisation is presented . Furthermore this work highlights the different requirements that have to be considered . Overall 51 different parameters for the total content and 36 different parameters for the emission by leaching are defined . An analysis of the defined parameter reveals that leaching parameters are significantly more to be considered compared to total content parameters . In order to assess the leaching behaviour nine different leaching tests including batch tests up flow percolation tests and one diffusion test are in place . A further discussion of leaching parameters showed that certain countries took over limit values initially defined for landfills for inert waste and adopted them for IBA utilisation . The overall utilisation rate of IBA in construction works is approximately 54wt . It is revealed that the rate of utilisation does not necessarily depend on how well regulated IBA utilisation is but rather seems to be a result of political commitment for IBA recycling and economically interesting circumstances .,Overview on regulations regarding bottom ash utilisation in 22 European countries. Diverse regulation of bottom ash utilisation in the EU. Utilisation rates vary between 0 and 100 between investigated countries. Critical discussion of limit values and comparison between countries. Proposal of key points for a uniform legislation at EU level.

711,Groundwater is the environmental compartment very often involved in the broader issues related to contaminated sites characterization and reclamation . It is not uncommon to find areas in which some substances directly linked to the petrographic composition of the aquifer reach high values exceeding the limits set by the regulations . These concentrations are defined as Natural Background Levels and the need to quantify their real contribution in areas subject to strong anthropogenic pressures represents an emerging problem . Global statistical analyses and laboratory testing are proposed here to distinguish between the impacts of different forcing influencing water quality in hydrogeological systems . The study focus on the application of a methodology based on the Component Separation analysis for the NBL estimation of selected chemical species in potentially contaminated aquifers flowing in the proximity of landfill areas and on the subsequent validation of the results through experimental studies of field samples . A site located in Calabria Italy and constituting a typical example of an aquifer which has been subjected to possible contact with the leachate produced by waste degradation is considered . The work is keyed to NBLs characterization of aluminum iron and manganese and to the identification of their natural component for a proper environmental assessment of the site . Estimated NBLs are consistent with the geochemical composition of site samples . The adopted methodology can represent a useful instrument to distinguish effective anthropogenic contamination from natural conditions and to define realistic environmental clean up goals .,Real case study analysing the sources of aquifers contamination in landfill areas. An intensive groundwater and soil sampling campaign was conducted in the study area. Joint application of global statistical methods and laboratory tests was performed. Natural Background Levels of chemicals were estimated for the investigated aquifer. The used approach leads to the definition of realistic environmental clean up goals.
712,The establishment of recycling network is critical to improve municipal solid waste management . However how to determine the best locations for the recycling stations and recycling centers remains to be solved . Under such a circumstance this study aims to forecast the MSW generation and develop a cost based location optimization model using p median method so that the optimal scale and location of recycling centers can be identified . Shanghai with an ambitious plan for promoting MSW recycling at the city level was selected as a case study city . Results show that Shanghais MSW generation rate will be about 3 from 2017 to 2020 . Regional distribution analysis shows that the downtown areas have higher intensity for MSW generation due to high population density and consumption level . Fourteen regional recycling centers were identified to be the optimal places for establishing recycling centers . The achievement of this scenario can lead to the lowest total cost of 144 million Chinese Yuan . Moreover the optimal results may change if unit transportation cost and unit scale cost are changed . For instance the optimal numbers of recycling centers will increase with the increase of unit transportation cost or decrease of unit scale cost . Finally model limitations and policy recommendations are raised by considering the local realities .,Location optimization model of recyclable MSW recycling center RRC was developed. The model was based on p median method and total cost minimization. The optimal number of RRCs for case of Shanghai China was proved to be 14. Optimized RRCs were located in rural area but surrounded populated urban area. Optimal RRCs will change with unit transportation cost and unit scale cost.

This substrate scarcely studied in the literature showed two peculiarities regarding two fundamental parameters in the digestion processes C N ratio and initial pH . Typically optimal C N varies from 20 to 30 but in this work an almost negligible role of this ratio is observed . We demonstrated it by investigating a very large C N interval from 9.7 to 50.1 not by adding selected nutrients to the system but exploiting the natural variation of the substrate . Concerning the pH we show that also typically considered unfavorable conditions are feasible for this substrate . In fact though neutral basic initial pH is proved to be optimal to run the digestion process in line with many other kinds of dungs also acid initial pH leads to satisfactory CH,Anaerobic digestion of water buffalo manure is studied in batch mode at 37C.

723,Existing studies have studied influencing factors of MSW generation behaviour at different spatial levels of organization but always one at a time and not simultaneously . Income is a strong influencing factor affecting MSW generation from the individual to the country level capable of hiding the effects of the others . This study shows that when MSW generation behaviour is holistically analysed across multiple levels of organization hierarchically organized as functional units of MSW generation within a specific study area it is possible to identify influencing factors in addition to income as explanatory variables . Increasing the number of influencing factors of MSW generation makes it possible to create a robust knowledge base for MSW management policies in fast growing urban areas of developing countries improving the information used to select proper policies and plans within their MSW management systems and avoiding overlapping policies causing legal gaps . Betania an urban area of the Panama City district has been chosen as a case study area . The results show that the household income explains 86 of its member MSW generation and the community indigenous population explains 21 of household MSW generation . It is concluded that MSW generation is not linear across levels it has as many degrees of freedom as influencing factors shaping the levels of organization where functional units generating waste exist . Influencing factors appearing at each spatial level affects MSW generation in an interdependent manner in variable degrees of magnitude .,Sudden changes in MSW generation behaviours are common to developing countries. Determined by social practices at multiple hierarchical spatial organization levels. Different influencing factors appear at each level and income is mostly the main one. Most studies conclude this from analyzing this link one spatial level at a time. Simultaneous analysis can reveal influencing factors others than income.

726,Several of the waste materials that have a negative impact on the sewer system are produced by fats oils and greases discharged from commercial and domestic kitchens . These materials accumulate at different points in the sewer catchment from kitchens to pumping stations sewers and sewage treatment works and comprise oily wastewater floating agglomerates and hard deposits . Despite their detrimental effects these waste materials have a high calorific content and are an ideal feedstock for energy recovery processes . So far the overall volume of each type of waste and their physical chemical properties in relation to their collection point are unknown . However from a management point of view knowledge on each feedstock quality and volumes is necessary to develop an economic viable solution for their collection and for energy recovery purposes .

727,We have developed a novel thermal hydrolysis process to extract and hydrolyze keratin from keratinous animal body wastes without using any chemicals . Our process consists of two heating steps one is to swell and denature the keratin protein network in the intermediate filaments while the other is to cleavage the disulfide bonds that connect the tight keratinous fibrils together . Using hog hair as an example the two step process achieved a nearly 70 keratin recovery yield with respect to the original keratin in the hog hair which is comparable to one of the best recovery yields by conventional chemical processes . The extracted keratin hydrolysate by THP was filtered by the shear wave induced membrane ultrafiltation for characterization . The molecular weight analysis using SDS PAGE and MALDI TOF mass spectroscopy has demonstrated that our keratin hydrolysis obtained by our two step THP has a wide range of MW distribution similar to those already in the hair care product market . The amino acid composition analysis has shown that our keratin hydrolysate by THP had twice as much essential amino acids as soybean meals on a dry mattter basis . As to the cysteine residue content we have shown that it can be controlled by adjusting the 2nd heating temperature .,A two step thermal hydrolysis process has been developed to extract keratin from hog hair.

In contrast the use of 100 replacement by mixed aggregates may increase the global warming indicator an 11 when double transport distance is assumed . But in exchange the waste generation decreases 35 and the abiotic depletion 50 . Aggregate transport distance is a key factor that will determine the cost energy consumption and global warming of the mixed recycled aggregate .,Recycled concretes were produced in the laboratory and in the concrete plant. Physico mechanical properties of the recycled concretes are analyzed and compared. Placement of recycled concrete in situ is described. Cost analysis of recycled concretes was performed. Environmental impact categories of recycled aggregate were obtained.

Three AD biosolids types with either no pretreatment THP or two hour fermentation were evaluated for differences in leachable dissolved organic matter DOM decomposition and nitrogen releases in biosolids incubated in sandy loam soil . DOM characterizations of size exclusion chromatography FTIR and fluorescence maxima Ex 400nm indicated similarities in among AD DOM that contrasted waste activated sludge Milorganite and Suwannee River Organic Matter . Fluorescence peak picking was a more adaptable analysis for shifted leachate spectra than fluorescence regional integration . Peak ratio analysis is recommended over FRI for biosolids DOM . The 3 month net inorganic N produced in biosolids soil incubations was 15512.1 14918.2 14017.4 and 35415.1mgN kg for AD biosolids with no pretreatment fermentation AD THP AD and Milorganite respectively . Overall there was limited evidence of differences in leachable organic matter quality or net mineral N release after 105days for AD solids with or without THP . Red shifted fluorescence of leachates decayed by day 45 in aerobic biosolids soil incubations suggesting that larger complex carbon sources liberated during solids stabilization may decompose readily in soils . Overall other variables may have a greater influence on final nutrient releases and organic matter quality than full scale pretreatments to AD alone . Critical and targeted application of DOM spectroscopy specific to biosolid leachates will improve use in advanced stabilization studies .,Fluorescence maxima Ex 400 unique to anaerobically digested AD leachates. Peak picking ratio analysis more targeted than Fluorescence Regional Integration. Similar N releases for AD solids with variable pretreatments during soil incubation. Fluorescence Ex 400 of leachable organic matter decayed during incubations. Targeted organic matter characterization informs biosolids management programs.

732,Instrument bundles placed within the Ste . Sophie landfill have been collecting temperature and settlement data since January 2010 . Previous modelling efforts simulated settlement based on a three component model to account for primary or instantaneous compression secondary compression or mechanical creep and time dependent biodegradation induced settlement . In northern climates where waste may be placed under frozen conditions a time dependent biodegradation induced settlement term is unable to simulate settlement due to biodegradation as waste temperatures transition from below zero to optimal values for anaerobic degradation . This paper presents a temperature dependent biodegration induced settlement model . The model simulates heat generation as a function of temperature and tracks the expended energy as the waste degrades . The ratio of the expended energy to the total potential expended energy is used in the proposed temperature dependent biodegradation induced settlement term . The new term better accounts for the delayed biodegradation process observed in wastes placed under frozen conditions . The model was able to simulate the settlement trends observed at the Ste .

733,Additives are ubiquitously used in plastics to improve their functionality . However they are not always desirable in their second life and are a major bottleneck for chemical recycling . Although research on extraction techniques for efficient removal of additives is increasing it resembles much like uncharted territory due to the broad variety of additives plastics and removal techniques . Today solvent based additive extraction techniques solid liquid extraction and dissolution precipitation are considered to be the most promising techniques to remove additives . This review focuses on the assessment of these techniques by making a link between literature and physicochemical principles such as diffusion and Hansen solubility theory . From a technical point of view dissolution precipitation is preferred to remove a broad spectrum of additives because diffusion limitations affect the solid liquid extraction recoveries . Novel techniques such as accelerated solvent extraction are promising for finding the balance between these two processes . Because of limited studies on the economic and environmental feasibility of extraction methods this review also includes a basic economic and environmental assessment of two extreme cases for the extraction of additives . According to this assessment the feasibility of additives removal depends strongly on the type of additive and plastic and also on the extraction conditions . In the best case scenario at least 70 of solvent recovery is required to extract plasticizers from polyvinyl chloride via dissolution precipitation with tetrahydrofuran while solid liquid extraction of phenolic antioxidants and a fatty acid amide slip agents from polypropylene with dichloromethane can be economically viable even without intensive solvent recovery .,An overview of occurrence and concentrations of additives is given. Different solvent based additive extraction techniques are discussed and compared. The review includes a basic economic and environmental assessment. The viability of additives removal depends strongly on case and extraction method. Diffusion impedes S L extraction solvent use impedes dissolution precipitation.
734,The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is an emergent unknown environmental problem linked to increased production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and as such understanding risk perception is fundamental . This study focuses on exploring causes and effects of environmental and health risk perception . Survey data was collected in Portugal Spain and France . Data illustrated that in France where the quantity of recycled pharmaceuticals is much higher respondents reported a higher need for knowledge but not a higher risk perception nor self reported behaviour . Although previous research illustrates that higher trust correlates with lower risk perception we found a positive correlation which highlights the need to comprehend these variables in emergent risks . Results further confirmed a hypothesized moderated mediation model to explain proper disposal behaviour . We found an indirect effect of risk perception on behaviour through intention which was stronger for participants with higher environmental identity . Understanding the causes and effects of risk perception of pharmaceuticals in the environment thereby contributes to improve pharmaceutical waste management processes and to promote the proper disposal of pharmaceuticals .,Pharmaceuticals in the environment is an emergent risk often unknown by the public. Need to promote the proper disposal of household pharmaceutical leftovers. Stage models of behaviour change highlight the relevance of risk perception.

738,Waste management historically focused on the protection of human health and the natural environment from the impacts of littering and dispersion of pollutants . An additional and more recent concern is the resource value of waste . Our analysis shows that the regulatory concept of waste in the European Union which comprises environmental principles the legal definition of waste legal requirements and policy implementation is not fit for addressing this concern . The legal definition of waste overlooks the context of waste fails to consider the interests of the waste user as opposed to the waste holder and aims to control the impacts of careless discarding rather than stimulating careful discarding . To address these challenges we suggest a legal requirement to recognise the potential of waste to be used operationalised by formulating a waste,The European definition of waste protects the environment and human health. The legal definition focuses on discarding and hampers prevention and recovery. A new legal requirement could address this without changing the definition. It requires to recognise identify quantify and fulfil waste use potential. Recognising use potential supports design and evaluation of waste policy.
739,The price of recyclable waste has declined and China is refusing solid waste imports . As a result recycling companies in South Korea are refusing to collect recyclable waste which caused a solid waste management crisis in April 2018 . Due to this crisis many people are unable to discard their recyclable waste . This study aims to assess the economic value of a sustainable recycling and waste management policy to solve the waste management crisis . The analysis in this study is divided into two parts The first part estimates the inconvenience costs to residents using a contingent valuation method whereas the second part analyzes the preferences for a new policy using a mixed logit model with a choice experiment . The results show that mean willingness to pay per household is 41 234 KRW year the total WTP would be able to increase the total disposal capacity by up to 4.51 . In addition at an adequate price level for the policy alternative the policy acceptance rate suggests that the price of biodegradable volume rate disposal bags should increase by no more than KRW 66 per bag . This study provides guidance to policy makers who wish to consider both validity and acceptability .,We assess the economic value of a sustainable recycling and waste management policy. We suggest policies to improve disposal capacity for stable recyclable waste management. We analyze the inconvenience cost of recycling and preference for a new policy. Total WTP can increase total recyclable waste disposal capacity by up to 4.51 . Considering the acceptance rate any fee increase should be less than KRW 66 per bag.
740,The establishment of recycling systems aiming at high quality recyclates from post consumer plastic waste are essential to avoid the waste of resources . One main impediment for introducing recyclates into the market is their unwanted odor . For this reason this study aimed at determining if the collection strategy affects the odor profile of post consumer LDPE bags . Furthermore the effect of hot water washing inspired by the conventional mechanical recycling procedure on the odor of post consumer LDPE bags was screened . More than 60 odorants were detected in LDPE bags collected in a separate plastic fraction as well as in LDPE bags from the non separated collection by means of gas chromatography olfactometry and 37 of them were unequivocally identified using two dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry olfactometry . The sensory results revealed that the type of collection affects the overall odor intensity the hedonic tone of the odor and the odor profile . Namely cheesy and fecal smelling odorants were predominant in the waste that had not been separated at source whereas odorants with earthy and moldy smells showed mostly higher intensity ratings in the waste separated at source . Short chain carboxylic acids likely originating from microbial spoilage of organic waste were found with higher dilution factors in the mixed fraction and could accordingly contribute to the observed differences . Additionally we could show that the hot washing procedure applied to the LDPE sample from the separate collection system significantly reduced the overall odor intensity from 8 to 6.3 . However the washed waste still showed high smell intensity ratings .,Significant differences in the odor of LDPE bags from two waste collection systems. A considerable odor intensity remained after lab scale hot washing 6.3 out of 10 . More than 60 odor active compounds were detected in post consumer LDPE bags. Either cheesy and fecal or earthy and moldy odors predominant in one sample.

These landfills are a major issue in shoreline management planning which aims to manage the risks associated with flooding and coastal erosion . Where landfills exist hold the line is often selected as the preferred SMP option although government funding is not available at present . To investigate these issues in detail three case study landfills are used to examine the risks of future flooding and erosion together with potential mitigation options . These cases represent a contrasting range of coastal landfill settings . The study includes consideration of sea level rise and climate change which exacerbates risks of erosion and flooding of landfills . It is fundamental to recognise that the release of solid waste in coastal zones is a problem with a geological timescale and these problems will not go away if ignored . Future erosion and release of solid waste is found to be more of a threat than flooding and leachate release from landfills . However while leachate release can be assessed there is presently a lack of methods to assess the risks from the release of solid waste . Hence a lack of science constrains the design of remediation options .,Release of solid waste in coastal zones is a problem with a geological timescale. Sea level rise will exacerbate risks of solid waste release from coastal landfills. Three sites with contrasting range of coastal scenarios affecting landfills studied. Erosion of solid wastes more of a problem than flooding and leachate release. Lack of methods to assess risks of solid waste release limits remediation options.

749,Long term planning of municipal solid waste management systems is a complex decision making problem which includes a large number of decision layers . Since all different waste treatment and disposal processes will show different responses to each municipal solid waste component it is necessary to separately evaluate all waste components for all processes . This obligation creates an obstacle in the programming of mass balances for long term planning of municipal solid waste management systems . The development of an ideal mixed integer linear programming model that can simultaneously respond to all essential decision layers including waste collection process selection waste allocation transportation location selection and capacity assessment has not been made possible yet due to this important modeling obstacle . According to the current knowledge of the literature all mixed integer linear programming studies aiming to address this obstacle so far have had to restrict many different possibilities in their mass balances . In this study a novel mixed integer linear programming model was formulated . ALOMWASTE the new model structure developed in this study was built to take into consideration different process capacity and location possibilities that may occur in complex waste management processes at the same time . The results obtained from a case study showed the feasibility of new mixed integer linear programming model obtained in this study for the simultaneous solution of all essential decision layers in an unrestricted mass balance .

However the efficacy of alkaline thermally treated PMR in soil amelioration and the potential contamination risk caused by introduced penicillin V are poorly understood . In this study soil pH the contents of organic matter available phosphorus available potassium were measured to study the effect of alkaline thermally treated PMR on soil fertility the numbers of culturable microorganisms and the activities of enzymes which not only reflect the decomposing ability of organic matter but also monitor the ecological suppression in soil ecosystem were also investigated moreover the persistence of introduced penicillin V and the variation of antibiotic resistance genes in soil were examined to evaluate the resulting antibiotic resistance risk . The results indicated that the pH and the content of available potassium in amended soil with treated PMR profoundly improved . In addition the culturable microorganisms and enzymes were not inhibited throughout the incubation of treated PMR in soil . The stability of treated PMR in soil relatively completed after 43days . More importantly the penicillin V derived by treated PMR rapidly depleted within 3days which suggested a relatively low environmental persistence . The treated PMR did not enrich the ARGs detected in soil demonstrating that the addition of treated PMR might not trigger the antibiotic resistance risk in the short term in soil . In conclusion our results concluded that alkaline thermally treated PMR is available for soil application .,The alkaline thermally treated PMR improved soil properties. Soil microorganisms and enzymes were not suppressed during the incubation. The alkaline thermally treated PMR in soil nearly matured after 43days. The introduced penicillin V in soil could not persist and dissipated within 3days. The alkaline thermally treated PMR did not enrich the ARGs in soil.

Pyrolysis conditions and feedstock determine the properties of the biochars produced . In order to understand the relationship between these variables we analysed in detail the physical chemical and surface characteristics of biochars produced from three contrasting agronomic residues abundantly generated in South Spain such as rice husk olive pit and pruning remains of olive trees using a temperature range from 350 to 600C and residence times from 0.5 to 4h . High pyrolysis temperature and time resulted in the greatest pH and C content in the biochars . In general elemental composition and ash content were dependent on the type of organic waste used as feedstock .,Effects of pyrolysis conditions on the biochar properties of three different organic waste. Biochars from rice husk olive pit and olive prunings were produced and characterized. C and N content mainly depended on biochar feedstock. Aryl C alkylC and hydrophobicity were predominately influenced by residence time. Feedstock and pyrolysis temperature conditioned water holding capacity and ash content.

754,In this study the feasibility of using municipal solid waste incineration fly ash as additive for the strengthening of pretreated cement stabilized soil was evaluated . Results indicated that the leaching concentrations of chromium and lead in MSWIFA after the water washing process and addition of 4 ferrous sulphate were reduced by 67 and 89 respectively which was lower than the limit value of Identification standard for hazardous waste . After pretreatment MSWIFA samples with ratios of 5 and 10 were blended into cement stabilized soil with ordinary Portland cement content of 10 15 and 20 . The unconfined compressive strength internal friction angle and cohesion of the cement stabilized soil increased with OPC and pretreated MSWIFA content . The same effect was observed on UCS after the addition of 10 PFA as replacement of 5 OPC . In the subsequent X ray powder diffraction test scanning electron microscopy and leaching tests the leaching concentrations of heavy metals in cement stabilized soil became far lower than the limit value under the synergistic effects of the physical encapsulation of hydration products and stabilization of chemical agents . The incorporation of PFA as a,MSWIFA is used for cement stabilized soil after pretreatment.

It was concluded that thermophilic conditions introduced H,Blackwater BW and kitchen organic waste KW were co digested with optimized VS ratio 1 2 . Co digestion of BW with KW improved energy recovery efficiency and reactor treatment capacity. The mesophilic reactor MR achieved higher organic loading rate than the thermophilic reactor TR . The MR achieved higher methane recovery efficiencies up to 83 . The poor performance of the TR was caused by H. inhiation introduced under higher temperature.
756,VOCs are the major harmful pollutants released from MSW landfills which are toxicity to human health . In order to in situ biodegradation of VOCs released from landfill two novel laboratory scale biocovers including waste char obtained from MSW pyrolysis and sewage sludge modified the WC are used to degradate VOCs . The removal performances of VOCs as well as the bacterial community in the WC and SWC are investigated in a simulated landfill systems with the contrast experiment of a landfill cover soil for 60days . Meanwhile the adsorption biodegradation of VOCs model compounds over the LCS WC and SWC are also tested in fixed bed adsorption reactor and in situ FTIR . The VOCs removal efficiencies by the SWC are maintained above 85 for a long term much higher than that of the LCS and WC . The higher removal efficiencies and long term stability for VOCs degradation in SWC are attributed to a strongly positive synergistic between adsorption and biodegradation that the gaseous VOCs released from MSW is effectively adsorbed by the SWC due to its higher VOCs adsorption capacity and then the adsorbed VOCs is converted into CO,The removal efficiencies of VOCs by the SWC range from 88.80 to 93.68 .

A synergistic between adsorption and biodegradation in the SWC exist.
757,The recalcitrance of green waste caused by its high lignocellulose content is a technical challenge for accelerating green waste composting . Adjusting the initial ratio of total carbon and total nitrogen to the optimal range of 2530 1 is a common strategy to accelerate the composting process . However because microorganisms can only utilize hydrosoluble nutrients directly we investigated whether maintaining the ratio of hydrosoluble carbon and hydrosoluble nitrogen within the optimal range through continuous urea addition can better accelerate green waste composting . We conducted a pilot scale composting experiment in which the aforementioned maintaining started at the beginning of composting or after the thermophilic phase . The results demonstrate that maintaining the optimal HC HN ratio starting at both periods can to some extent direct the TC TN ratio toward 2530 1 and can also significantly improve heat generation pH lignocellulose degradation and humification . Moreover lignin degradation was improved by 3.157.33 cellulose degradation was improved by 6.488.15 and carbon content of humus was increased by 7.1916.13 . Although the maturity assessment showed that none of the final compost reached maturity within the limited experimental period based on the promoted lignocellulose degradation and humification we conclude that maintaining the HC HN ratio within the optimal range is a more efficient method to accelerate green waste composting compared to the initial TC TN adjustment only once .,Effects of maintaining optimal HC HN ratio to green waste composting was studied. Maintaining optimal HC HN ratio can accelerate lignocellulose degradation. Maintaining optimal HC HN ratio can improve humification.

The increment rate of humic like substances ranged from 19 to 81 in different cases . It has been aware of that stabilization procedures coupled the degradation of simple organics with the synthesis of complex organics . Therefore an alternative methodology considering the content of humic like substances and the fluorescence complexity index in the end products was proposed to evaluate the stabilization level . Humic like substances indicate the ecological value of the end products . Fluorescence complexity index combining the reduction of protein like substances with the increment of humic like substances can predict the humification degree . The new criterion can be the supplementary of the current ones .,Sixteen sludge treatment plants in China were investigated and analyzed.

760,With the proposed Circular Economy Package the European Union is striving to play a leading role in the implementation of recycling goals . The significantly increased recycling targets are just some of the defined objectives . However to assess the Member States attainment of the new recycling targets the European Union still builds on a purely quantitative recycling rate assessment procedure that neglects to include qualitative recycling aspects . This circumstance could lead to additional quality losses in recycling processes because recyclers might tend to focus exclusively on higher quantities to achieve the stricter recycling targets on time . To prevent such a development the aim of this study is to establish a complementary recycling indicator that combines quantitative and qualitative recycling aspects in one single metric . The basis of this assessment method is the statistical entropy approach which enables the concentrating or diluting effect of a recycling process brought about through the separation or mixing of materials to be measured . The results of the statistical entropy metric will provide greater insight into recycling processes and thereby yield enhanced information on the quantity and purity of recycling outputs . The simple structure of the new approach will allow enhanced comparisons between technologies as well as national recycling performance . A case study on plastic packaging recycling demonstrates that the new recycling indicator provides multifaceted findings relative to the hitherto purely quantitative recycling assessment data hence enriching conclusions on the recycling performance .,New recycling performance assessment incorporating qualitative recycling aspects. Differences in qualities can be located with the. indicator. High quality recycling outputs lead to a better result of the recycling performance. as a complement indicator to the European recycling rates.
761,Biochar from agricultural biomasses and solid wastes represents a win win solution for a rational waste management . Its sustainable usage requires the identification and standardization of biochar characteristics . The aim of this work was to identify the physical chemical and spatial characteristics of biochars from pruning residues poultry litter and anaerobic cattle digestate at two pyrolysis temperatures . The biochar characterization was carried out by applying emerging imaging techniques 2D automated optical image analysis and hyperspectral enhanced dark field microscopy and by SEM analysis . As predictable the feedstock composition and the pyrolysis temperature strongly influence the physical structures of the biochar samples . Irrespective of charring temperature PR biochar was mainly characterized by a broken and fragmented structure with an irregular and rough particle surface completely different from the original PR wood cell . The EDFM imaging analysis evidenced the thermal degradation of PR vegetal products composed primarily of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin . On the contrary small and regular particles with a smooth surface were produced by the PL pyrolysis especially at 550C due to the lower PL morphological homogeneity in comparison with the other biomasses . Finally CD charring at both temperatures was characterized by changes in chemical composition suggested by a lower pixel intensity . In conclusion the emerging imaging techniques used in this study proved to be very effective in analyzing some properties of biochars and can therefore be considered as promising experimental strategies for detecting the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature of biochar .,Image analysis detected modifications of pruning residue particles after charring. SEM showed nonporous surface on poultry litter particles after 550C pyrolysis. Hyperspectral EDFM image highlighted cattle digestate biochar formed by semi crystalline aggregates. Emerging imaging techniques are effective for characterizing biochar properties.
762,In the South Tyrol region 46 gasifiers are currently operating and 200 000 are annually paid to dispose of as a waste 1300 tons of char . Therefore there is a considerable interest in finding alternatives for the valorization of this solid by product . The aim of this work is to assess the potential of char as energy source and to compare two scenarios . The first scenario considers the possibility of exploiting char in a dedicated burner integrated in the gasification plant . The second scenario assumes that all the char is collected from South Tyrol and co fired with biomass in an existing combustion ORC plant . An economic analysis was performed evaluating the discounted payback time and both scenarios were modeled using Aspen Plus . The results reveal that substantial savings in the operating costs of the plants can be achieved . In the first scenario the owners of the gasification plants could save from 50 to 94 of the char disposal costs with a payback time ranging between 3 and 7years . In the second scenario the owner of the plant could save approximately 235k per year with a payback time of approximately 7years . The present study provides a basis for further techno economic studies on char combustion . The results can be helpful for the owners of the gasification plants in determining the most cost effective way to dispose char and to avoid disposing it of as a waste . Furthermore it is demonstrated how char could be used as a renewable fuel with better performance than raw biomass .,Techno economic potentialities of gasification char as energy source are assessed. Biomass and char gasification and combustion processes are modeled. The use of char can reduce the operating costs of biomass plants. Payback time of the char combustion equipment can be lower than 4years.

766,This work evaluates the potential of hydrothermal carbonization to valorize the digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge into useful materials for P and energy recovery . The hydrothermal treatment of digestate at 180240C did not lead to high rank hydrochars . On the other hand inorganic P concentration did not change with the temperature while as the carbonization temperature increased the organic P retention yield in hydrochar became lower increasing the total P in the process water obtained at the highest temperature up to 25.3 . P recovery from acid leaching of the hydrochar obtained at 180C via precipitation with CaO at pH up to 9 led to a brown solid precipitate with total P content close to 42mgg,Thermal treatment improves digestate P leachability. Acid leaching led to lignite like upgraded hydrochars with HHV. Leachate neutralisation with CaO enabled the precipitation of P rich brown solids. High energy recovery was obtained hydrochars and methane from AD of PW .
767,Impurities in biowaste such as plastics glass metals and inert material negatively impact the operation of anaerobic digestion plants and compost quality and have to be removed prior to the anaerobic digestion process . Different mechanical pretreatments are available for this purpose . However data on the removal efficiencies of pretreatment systems for different types of biowaste and for different kinds of impurities are still scarce . This study aims to determine the efficiencies for impurity removal of four biowaste pretreatment plants at real scale drum screen shredder piston press shredder piston press screw press separation mill and pulper drum screen . BTP 1 treats mixed food and garden wastes while BTP 2 3 and 4 treat mostly food waste . The efficiency of the pretreatment systems was influenced by the type of pretreated biowaste . The recovery of organics by the press was more efficient when pretreating food waste than for treating mixed food and garden wastes . BTP 3 presented the highest recovery of biogas but also the highest transfer of inert particles to the substrate . On the contrary BTP 4 was the most efficient for the removal of inert particles however this system also presented 18 loss of biogas potential .,Four biowaste pretreatment systems for impurity removal were investigated. Two types of biowaste were tested food waste and mixed food and garden waste. Bulky material in mixed food and garden waste caused high losses of organics. The selection of the best technology should be customized for each waste type.
768,Hydrochars are materials with a promising future as their high carbon content and porosity renders them suitable for uses including peat substitutes soil remediation and carbon adsorbent precursors . Combining hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis offers the prospect to provide advanced materials with a higher porosity and carbon content . This approach would mitigate drawbacks associated to hydrochars including phytotoxicity . This research studied the influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the resulting properties of chars made from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass wastes at 200C for 4h and compared them to biochars that had not received any prior hydrothermal carbonization . Interestingly hydrochar followed by pyrolysis was able to result in phytostimulation while when only pyrolysis was carried out phytotoxicity was eliminated but no phytostimulant effect was observed . In addition the results indicated that the higher and longer the pyrolysis temperature and duration time respectively the more microporosity was generated while phytotoxicity was reduced . In addition aromaticity and thermal stability significantly increased with pyrolysis treatment . Consequently hydrochars improve their properties and offer more potential for environmental applications after a pyrolysis post treatment .,Pyrolysis used as post treatment to improve hydrochar. Treated hydrochars become less phytotoxic. Hydrothermal carbonization pyrolysis resulted in better pore development. Pyrolysis at 550C during 5h increases BET of hydrochar to more than 130m

By applying the model on several cases of liquid anaerobic digestion it was noticed that L AD at mesophilic condition with 25 retention days seemed to be superior to other cases of L AD with regard to energy turnover . However even if similar methane production were observed for L AD and SS AD the model suggested higher energy turnover for the case of SS AD at thermophilic condition being 10 more in average in comparison with cases of L AD .,ORWARE model was enabled to simulate SS AD with plug flow reactor. Model predicted methane digestate yield energy turnover for a full scale SS AD. L AD and SS AD at different temperatures had similar methane yield. Thermophilic SS AD had higher energy turnover than mesophilic L AD.
780,Brazil stands out as one of the largest world powers in the agribusiness sector and with the increase of production capacity an enormous amount of waste is generated that cause serious environmental problems . Acerola is evidenced as one of the fruits of growing and important commercialization contributing significantly to regional development through the export of concentrated powder product . Thus in order to minimize the environmental impacts generated by the local fruit processing industry the proximate analysis of its residue after drying in a convective oven at temperatures of 50 75 and 100C was carried out in this work aiming at the reuse of this residue for thermochemical processes . Moisture ash volatile matter and fixed carbon content were analyzed as well as characterizations such as infrared spectroscopy elemental analysis calorific value and thermogravimetry . The results showed a significant difference in the moisture contents VM FC and elemental carbon for the dry residue at 50C compared to the temperatures of 75 and 100C while for the ash content there was no significant difference between the temperatures . The dry acerola residue at the three temperatures studied presented adequate properties for thermochemical application with lignocellulosic compounds that can be converted by thermochemical route good levels of calorific power low moisture and ash content associated with high amount of volatile matter .,The drying temperature led to significant differences in physicochemical contents. The biomass maintained the structure of functional groups after thermal treatment. The high value of volatile matter content is suitable for the pyrolytic processes. The HHV H C and O C ratios were analogous to biomasses used in energy generation.
781,Effective gas permeability is an important parameter in the design of methane oxidation systems governing diffusive oxygen ingress and the spatial spread of landfill gas . The influences of soil texture compaction soil moisture and the resulting air filled porosity on the gas permeability were researched by performing pressure loss experiments on two loamy sands currently in use as methane oxidation layer material . These experiments mimicked the influence of the intrinsic soil properties the construction method and the local climate on the soils permeability . In both soils effective and specific permeability were strongly impacted by the level of soil compaction whereas increasing moisture contents had little effect in one of the soils only reducing effective permeability when a certain threshold was exceeded . In the other soil structure forming processes induced by the addition of water led to an increase in both effective and specific permeability with increasing moisture . It is concluded that the spatial spread of the landfill gas in the gas distribution layer is predominantly affected by texture and compaction of the overlying methane oxidation layer . In terms of methane oxidation system design the choice of material and construction method have more impact on gas permeability than seasonal changes in soil moisture in moderate climates . Furthermore air filled porosity on its own is not adequate to estimate the effective permeability of loamy sand for methane oxidation layers . Further research should address the estimation of effective gas permeability based upon soil texture bulk density and soil moisture combined .,For the researched soils compaction influences permeability more than moisture. Compaction mainly influences the coarse pores which contribute most to permeability. The relationship between air filled porosity and permeability is soil specific. Moisture can induce inter aggregate macroporosity and thereby increase permeability.
782,Nowadays increasingly complex sets of indicators are used to compare and diagnose municipal solid waste management . These sets incorporate new priorities regarding sustainability and focus on measuring the progress to zero waste .

Includes ten indicators that encompass street cleaning collection and disposal. Study cases show what information can be available in developing countries. A method to appraise the reliability of indicators based on data quality. Results show the need to increase MSW collection coverage and disposal conditions.
783,Due to insufficient land and energy resources municipal solid waste incineration plants are used in many countries as a means of addressing the growing volumes of generated municipal solid waste and to recover energy resources . Taiwan s government allows the private sector to offer municipal solid waste treatment services and electricity to the public . Revenue from the sale of electricity is an important source of income for municipal solid waste incineration plants . Although several studies have examined the technical efficiency of municipal solid waste incineration plants previous studies have not measured or deconstructed the dynamic electricity revenue inefficiency of incineration plants .

This study applied the proposed model to analyze the electricity revenue inefficiency of the municipal solid waste incineration plants in Taiwan over the period of 20132018 . In this study we found that the main source of electricity revenue inefficiency is the technical waste from electricity production . Our empirical analysis reveals that the electricity technical revenue and allocative efficiencies of public plants are lower than those of private plants .,We present a dynamic additive model to measure and decompose revenue inefficiency. Our model is used to measure revenue inefficiency in Taiwans incineration plants. The main source of electricity revenue inefficiency is technical waste. Ownership impacts all inefficiency results for Taiwans incineration plants. The POO plants have the lower efficiency inferior of other operating plants.

786,The expansion of urban green areas has boosted the accumulation of gardening lignocellulosic residues that could be potentially used to produce platform chemicals like lactic acid . However when using lignocelluloses pretreatment step such as steam explosion is often needed to favour sugar release . Considering that the conversion of glucose from cellulose has been widely addressed this work is focused on the valorisation of the steam exploded gardening liquid fraction rich in hemicellulosic sugars . Since oligomeric sugars are usually solubilized during steam explosion an enzymatic hydrolysis step was required in some cases to increase the monosaccharides content . Although the presence of inhibitors released during pretreatment hindered hydrolysis yields the addition of hemicellulases and the enzyme dosage optimization resulted in 85 89 and 95 of glucose xylose and arabinose release from soluble oligomers respectively .,Gardening residues are proposed as a new source of sugars to produce lactic acid. Hemicellulases addition enhances not only xylose but also glucose hydrolysis. Lower formic acid content in the prehydrolysates implied higher hydrolysis yields. Organic acids hampered total xylose consumption when the pH was not controlled. Hydrolysate fermentation with NaOH addition yielded 95 of the maximum lactic acid.
787,Cattle manure is a major livestock waste in agroecosystem and in situ catalytic pyrolysis is considered as a potential technology for its disposal .

Liquid liquid phase separation is used for metal enrichment. Amphoteric metals are separated by low temperature alkaline smelting. Noble metals gold and silver are efficiently enriched to form a high value group.
790,While driving the regional economy industrial parks also pose great threats to natural environment due to large quantities of resource consumption and intensive pollutants emissions . Eco industrial development including cleaner production bioproducts or waste interchange and infrastructure sharing is key to improving the parks environmental quality and sustainability . However how to measure the performance of eco industrial development is an essential and hard work since the material and energy flows are complex and can not be compared in various units . The water and non renewable resources which are very vital materials to sustain industrial activities in the industrial parks were rarely considered in the previous traditional ecological footprint analysis . Therefore our research depicts a real picture of all the resources including water and non renewable resources to illustrate the actual environmental impact of a national high technology industrial development zone Jiangyin high technology Park using energy based ecological footprint method . Results show that the emergy ecological footprint deficit and emergy ecological footprint intensity of the study park decreased by 16.75 and 16.74 due to the implementation of eco industrial development . In detail minerals made the largest reduction 2.00E 2ha capita followed by fossil fuels with a reduction of 1.01E 2ha capita and the resources from cropland and pasture did not make a contribution in reducing emergy ecological footprint . Policy implications such as further replenishing and improving the ecological industry chains are proposed based on this survey . This study provides a basis to improve the environmental management and performance of industrial parks .,A hybrid indicator was used to assess environmental impact of industrial park. Water and metals were considered compared to traditional ecological footprint study. Waste treatment and recycling was considered in the environmental assessment. Emergy ecological footprint fell by 3.52E 7ha due to eco industrial development. Emergy ecological deficit decreased by 16.75

794,There is a growing need to recycle construction and demolition waste in order to treat the huge amount of CDW in many metropolises of China . However the CDW recycling industry is still in its initial stage and developed unevenly across various areas of China . In spite of some qualitative discussions the quantitative analysis of crucial policies to the development of CDW recycling industry was overlooked . Through literature review nine influential policy instruments were identified in term of three categories i.e . control and command policy market based policy and information based policy . The stepwise regression analysis was employed to explore the relationships between the influential policies and the development level of CDW recycling industry in 52 sample Chinese cities . The results demonstrated that Green Product Label Charge and Tax and Technical Standards had statistically significant association with the development of CDW recycling industry in sample cities . In the surveyed cities Charge or Tax was the most common policy tool but Green Product Label and Technological standards were rather less frequently employed . According to the results Green Product Label and Technical Standards should be given higher priority . In addition landfill charge should be introduced as a fundamental impetus . These results provide directions for other cities to facilitate the development of their CDW recycling industry .,Key policies to promote the CDW recycling are quantitatively explored. The stepwise regression was employed to evaluate the effect of the nine policies. Green product label is the top policy followed by Charge and Tax and Technical Standard. 84.6 of the sample cities employed the Charge and Tax. The ratios were only 11.5 for Technical Standard and 7.7 for Green Product Label.
795,Recently the issues of land based plastics and their associated challenges in the marine world have been widely publicised in the media and scientific literature . Thus far despite these communications there have been few reports that have focused on the issues that acute plastic waste generation and its poor management pose to human health and the global environment . Also articles on ways to mitigate these issues particularly in sub Saharan Africa have not been documented . Indeed there is significant scope for improvements in plastic waste management in developing countries which offer a wide range of economic and environmental benefits . Plastic waste generation in sub Saharan Africa is dependent on many factors like urbanization etc . Currently the population of sub Saharan Africa is around 1 billion as of the year 2019 the amount of generated waste is 180 million tonnes at the rate of 0.5 per capita per day the amount that is openly dumped is 70 and the plastic waste generated annually is 17 million tonnes . Therefore this study aims to provide an overview of the plastic lifecycle and problems associated with plastic waste management in sub Saharan Africa including current practices public participation and opinion and government regulations . In addition this highlight aims to outline the impact of plastic waste proliferation on man and the environment and the economic and environmental benefits of proper plastic waste management .

In comparison to MAR mono digestion co digestion with thickened activated sludge produced less methane but reduced H,Valorization of macroalgal residues by anaerobic digestion. Knife milling and alkaline pretreatment enhanced methane production. In semi continuous reactors alkaline pretreatment enhanced methane by 20 . Digestates did not exhibit phytotoxicity. Digestate from codigestion with sludge led to the highest tomato plant growth.
797,Treated waste water sludge are frequently recycled in agricultural lands however this practice has polluted soils with microplastics nanoplastics synthetics heavy metals pharmaceuticals and engineered nanoparticles . This study analyses many of the significant research outcomes in this area and proposes the urgent reduction of biosolids recycling in farmlands aiming to eliminate their use altogether as soon as practicable and instead to utilise this material as a source of brick firing energy in the manufacturing of fired clay bricks and as a replacement for virgin brick soil . Based on a comprehensive data analysis this study has calculated that in the European Union the United States China Canada and Australia approximately 26 042 21 249 13 660 1 518 and 1 241 tonnes of microplastics respectively are added to farmlands annually as a result of biosolids application . The accumulation of microplastics produces detrimental effects on soil organisms and increases the accumulation of other micropollutants such as heavy metals . The degradation of MPs over time is a source for the creation of nanoplastics which pose a greater threat to ecosystems and human and animal health as their size allows for their absorption into plant cells . On the other hand the results of a comprehensive study at RMIT including a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment confirm that recycling biosolids in fired clay bricks is a promising sustainable alternative . This study proposes the mandatory addition of 7 biosolids in all brick manufacturing worldwide to utilize all biosolids production in fired clay bricks . This will reduce brick firing energy by over 12.5 .,Biosolids add tonnes of microplastics MPs and pollutants to farmlands annually. Approximately 0.53 by weight of biosolids applied to farmlands is MPs. During biosolid treatment virgin MPs attract heavy metals absorbable by plants. Degradation of MPs over time creates nanoplastics NPs absorbable by plants. A proposal to recycle all biosolids sustainably by incorporating 7 in fired bricks.
798,Levoglucosan is served as a significant versatile product to generate high value added chemicals and pharmaceutical additives . Levoglucosan was predominately produced from pyrolysate of cellulose . However the direct fast pyrolysis of waste biomass produces a small quantity of levoglucosan in comparison with the theoretical value of cellulose . This study explored Fenton pretreatment as a possible route to enhance levoglucosan yield during the fast pyrolysis of the waste corncob . The experimental results showed that different Fenton pretreated conditions and pyrolytic temperatures played vital roles in the formation of levoglucosan . The levoglucosan yield from fast pyrolysis at 500C of corncob pretreated by Fenton reaction of 14mL g H,The Fenton pretreatment of waste biomass prior to fast pyrolysis was investigated. Fenton pretreated biomass obtained higher levoglucosan yield than raw biomass. Fenton pretreated biomass can obtain levoglucosan at low pyrolytic temperature. Fenton pretreatment removed effectively alkali and alkaline earth metals.
799,Solid waste materials refer to those municipal or industrial or even domestic wastes that are massively produced during manufacture as well as daily life . A wide variety of solid wastes are generated but only a few of them are employed in pavement structures . To achieve the task papers between 2014 and 2019 from top journals which address waste management waste characterization and economic and environmental assessment were collected at first . Then the scope of solid waste materials was narrowed down based on their applications In the end six most popular solid waste materials were selected for further study and for the review namely recycled concrete aggregates reclaimed asphalt pavement fly ash bottom ash waste rubber and waste plastics . The reason why only these six solid waste materials are selected is that the rest are neither massively produced not can they be directly used in pavement structures . This review article contains structural properties treatments novel researches environmental analysis and economic analysis of each solid waste material . The objective of this review article is to provide future researchers with the latest research findings limitations and improvements in this subject . In conclusion quite a few novel researchers in terms of workmanship construction methodology and treatments are collected for all six materials . Furthermore an increasing number of findings have proven that most solid waste materials have both environmental and economic benefits when applied in field . Future researchers are encouraged to implement researches on solid waste materials in pavement engineering with consideration of both material properties and environmental economic effects .,Majority of solid waste has no potential threat to environment and human health. Utilization of RAP reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals. Utilization of rubber reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dust particles. Substitution virgin binder with polystyrene can enlarge the life expectancy. Environmental and economic effects of waste materials are demanded.
800,The aim of the present study was to perform the first assessment of the abundance and classification of marine debris as well as determine the sources transport and fate of this debris on an urbanized coast with multiple human activities . More than 80 of the marine debris was composed of synthetic materials . The beached marine debris was classified according to size . Meso debris accounted for the highest portion of contamination followed by macro debris and small debris . Contamination by debris such as cotton swabs and lollipop sticks accounted for the largest portion of the small debris class . Human recreational activities were the predominant source of debris followed by navigation fishing activities domestic activities and industrial port activities . The assessment of the predominance of human activities and the results of the model revealed a larger contribution of debris from recreational activities on nearby beaches on the small to larger scale and that rivers exert less of an influence due to the fact that they do not flow the entire year .,The soruces and fate of marine debris on the coastal region of Fortaleza was assessed using local observations and numerical modeling. Human recreational activities were the predominant source of debris on the area. Contamination by debris such as cotton swabs and lollipop sticks was high.
801,In the last decade door to door waste collection methods have been largely applied by several municipalities in Italy with the main purpose to achieve higher rates of sorted waste . This approach requires waste collectors to handle a high number of small waste containers during their work shift especially in urban areas and historic city centres . Workers may experience ergonomic issues during door to door waste collection due to the characteristics of the waste containers the waste collection equipment the work organization and citizens behaviour . If not well planned and managed this activity may expose waste collectors to ergonomic risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders .,During Door to Door Waste Collection DDWC workers experience ergonomic issues. This study introduces organic green and residual DDWC practises in a city centre. Four decisional variables for DDWC practises are identified. Ergonomics analysis reveals the impact of decisional variables on workers safety. Results shows that DDWC can be a sustainable activity if well analysed and managed.
802,Graft versus host disease is a common complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation that carries a high mortality . Although calcineurin inhibitors have been widely used in GVHD prophylaxis the incidence of acute GVHD remains at roughly 30 to 50 . Moreover some allo SCT recipients can not tolerate CNI . Thus improved GVHD prevention methods are needed . Our study aimed to determine the prophylactic value of ruxolitinib for GVHD in CNI intolerant patients after allo SCT . Between September 2017 and March 2019 10 patients with hematopoietic malignancies after allo SCT who were intolerant to CNI at our center were enrolled in this study . The regimens were based on a myeloablative busulfan and cyclophosphamide regimen . Antithymocyte globulin was administered to patients with an HLA haploidentical related donor at a dosage of 6 mg kg . All received ruxolitinib to replace CNI as GVHD prophylaxis . Ruxolitinib was initiated at 5 to 10 mg twice daily until 2 to 3 months post transplantation and then tapered gradually and in the absence of GVHD discontinued by day 180 . Eight patients had acute leukemia 1 patient had myeloproliferative neoplasm and 1 patient had natural killer T cell lymphoma . The donor type was a matched sibling donor in 3 patients and an HLA haploidentical related donor in 7 patients . All patients received CNI plus short course of methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis but showed intolerance to CNI within 45 days post transplantation . After ruxolitinib replacement only 1 patient developed grade II skin aGVHD within 100 days and only 1 patient developed severe aGVHD after 100 days . Two patients developed moderate severe chronic GVHD after tapering or stopping ruxolitinib resulting in a 1 year cumulative incidence of moderate severe cGVHD of 21.4 . Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred in 4 patients and Epstein Barr virus reactivation occurred in 3 patients . None of the patients developed CMV disease or EBV post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder . After a median follow up of 11 months 2 patients relapsed and 7 were alive of whom 6 were negative for minimal residual disease and 4 were off immunosuppressant therapy . The prophylactic application of ruxolitinib for CNI intolerant patients after allo SCT appears to be safe and effective in preventing GVHD but this awaits further study in larger cohorts .,This observational study showed that calcineurin inhibitor replacement by ruxolitinib as graft versus host disease GVHD prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing acute and chronic GVHD in those calcineurin inhibitor intolerant patients. Ruxolitinib is tolerable as prophylactic regimen with a low rate of severe bacterial infection.
803,Intestinal flora plays an essential role in regulating immune responses . Changes in the gut flora are associated with poor prognosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We aimed to investigate the impact of diverse intestinal flora on survival after allogeneic HSCT . Using next generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene we found that the intestinal microbiota of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT differed significantly from that of healthy controls . Furthermore dysbiosis persisted for at least 1 year after transplantation . Interestingly increased abundance of the genus,Dysbiosis persists for at least 1 year after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT . An increased abundance of. indicates intestinal devastation in HSCT. 16S rRNA analysis of intestinal flora at 1 month post HSCT predicts long term outcome.
804,Treatment options are limited for patients with hematologic malignancies who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . We conducted a pilot study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of low dose nivolumab a PD 1 inhibitor as maintenance therapy after allo SCT . Of the 4 patients enrolled in the study all rapidly developed immune related adverse events 2 patients experienced serious adverse events including grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 autoimmune encephalopathy . As a result of these unexpected severe toxicities the study was closed to further enrollment . Even at low doses nivolumab maintenance in the post allo SCT setting can cause serious irAEs beyond graft versus host disease and further studies of dosage and timing after allo SCT are needed .,Even at low doses nivolumab maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplantation allo SCT can cause serious immune related toxicities. We report rapid unexpected occurrences of grade 3 4 immune related adverse events. Nivolumab enhanced the graft versus tumor response but more studies are needed to improve tolerability.
805,Human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis has a high mortality rate . Among those who survive 80 develop some type of permanent neurologic disorder . Early diagnosis and treatment may help prevent long term sequelae . There have been several case reports as well as retrospective and prospective studies associating HHV 6 encephalitis with some form of sodium imbalance either hyponatremia or hypernatremia however the exact frequency post HCT is unknown with reports ranging from 30 to 100 . We performed a systematic review of the literature and found 34 cases of HHV 6 encephalitis reported in conjunction with sodium imbalance that documented the timing of that imbalance relative to the onset of encephalitis . Sodium imbalance occurred before or at the onset of HHV 6 encephalitis in all but 2 cases . This finding supports previous suggestions that sodium imbalance can be considered an early indicator of the potential development or presence of HHV 6 encephalitis in at risk patient populations .,An abnormal sodium level before or at the onset of human herpesvirus 6 HHV 6 encephalitis is seen in 94 of cases. Hyponatremia accounts for 85 of cases of sodium imbalance with HHV 6 encephalitis. Hyponatremia may be an early indicator of HHV 6 encephalitis especially after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
806,Nonmalignant blood diseases such as bone marrow failure disorders immune dysregulation disorders and hemoglobinopathies often lead to shortened life spans and poor quality of life . Many of these diseases can be cured with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation but patients are often not offered the procedure because of perceived insufficient efficacy and or excess toxicity . In 2018 the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network convened a task force to identify the most urgently needed yet feasible clinical trials with potential to improve the outcomes for patients with nonmalignant diseases . This report summarizes the task force discussions and specifies the network plans for clinical trial development for nonmalignant blood diseases .,Nonmalignant blood diseases are curable by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT . Too few patients are offered BMT due to perceived risks. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network has prioritized diseases for clinical trial development. Bone marrow failure is the top priority followed by thalassemia.
807,Telehealth involves the use of telecommunication and information technology for the delivery of clinical care and may be a mechanism to alleviate the burden of visits faced by patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation . Few studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth visits in the care of HCT patients . We conducted 27 telehealth visits with 25 patients undergoing HCT using a videoconferencing system that allows for real time 2 way interactions and administered satisfaction surveys to patients and providers . Of the 25 patients included in the study 20 and 5 were undergoing autologous and allogeneic HCT respectively . The telehealth visits were distributed as follows 3 inpatient visits upon admission for HCT 11 inpatient visits between 2 and 14 days post HCT 4 inpatient visits prior to discharge after HCT 8 outpatient post HCT follow up visits and 1 handoff to a community oncologist . Out of a total of 54 provider assessments 7 providers were unable to complete some part of the physical examination but no provider reported being unable to manage patients symptoms through telehealth . Eighty one percent of patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with the telemedicine session . Overall satisfaction was higher among patients than providers . Technological barriers resulting in delays and suboptimal physical examination were largely responsible for provider dissatisfaction . The use of telehealth to deliver comprehensive follow up care to HCT patients is feasible across different HCT types but is dependent upon quality of data streaming and videoconferencing technologies .,Telehealth use for follow up care delivery is feasible across different hematopoietic cell transplantation types. Patients report greater satisfaction with telehealth use compared with providers. Feedback is essential to optimize telehealth usability and provider satisfaction.
808,It has been suggested that bridging therapy with intensive chemotherapy and or hypomethylating agents followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be valuable in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes . However the influence of this approach on HSCT outcomes remains poorly defined . Therefore our objective was to investigate the influence of treatment before HSCT in patients with MDS . We retrospectively analyzed data from the Latin American registry of 258 patients from 17 Latin American centers who underwent HSCT from 1988 to 2019 . Our data showed that there was pre HSCT . We detected no significant difference regarding the impact on overall survival of treated and untreated patients before HSCT . Despite these data the type of previous treatment among treated patients showed a significant difference in overall survival . Treatment with hypomethylating agents together with pre HSCT chemotherapy seems to result in better survival of the studied population . These data correspond to the first results obtained through cooperative work between various centers in Latin America comparing the different approaches to patients and reflecting their reality and challenges . Therefore the selection of pretransplant bridge therapy should be analyzed and focus given primarily to those approaches that result in better survival of patients with MDS .,In pre hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT treated and untreated patients there is no difference in survival. The type of pre HSCT treatment has a significant difference in overall survival. Hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy in pre HSCT treatment improve myelodysplastic syndrome survival.
809,The significance of clonal evolution in myelofibrosis relapse remains poorly understood . Here we performed panel sequencing in paired samples of 30 patients with MF who relapsed after undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We identified a median of 2 mutations in a median of 2 genes before allo SCT along with a median of 2 mutations in 2 genes at relapse . Additional whole genome sequencing did not elucidate additional molecular changes . Taken together our data provide further evidence here on MF that clonal evolution after alloSCT is limited and that instead alloSCT selects specific clones .,Limited clonal evolution of myelofibrosis occurs after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Clones are controlled. Driver mutations are unaltered.
810,In a systematic review and meta analysis we compared allogeneic transplant outcomes after myeloablative conditioning versus reduced intensity conditioning in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes . Only 2 published randomized clinical trials were found with a pooled sample size of 183 . Both studies suggested an overall survival advantage after RIC with a pooled hazard ratio of .67 .41 to 1.09 for RIC versus MAC . Relapse results were also concordant with a pooled HR of 1.55 for RIC versus MAC . Neither result was statistically significant . Comparisons for other outcomes were unremarkable . In conclusion the evidence for the optimal conditioning intensity in myelodysplastic syndromes is weak . Post transplant maintenance strategies and incorporation of genomic information into decision making may improve post transplant outcomes .,The evidence for MAC versus RIC in allografted patients with MDS is poor. We found no significant differences between RIC and MAC in pooled analysis.
811,Primary myelofibrosis and secondary MF developing after polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia are clonal disorders of hematopoiesis . Currently the sole therapy offering the potential of cure is hematopoietic cell transplantation . Several risk classification systems including clinical hematologic and mutational parameters have been proposed . We analyzed the mutational landscape in addition to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System plus in 55 patients with MF to determine the combined impact on post HCT outcome . Mutations analyzed in 75 genes were most common in,Mutation load improved the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System DIPSS plus classification in patients with myelofibrosis MF undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Patients with MF with 3 mutations in addition to. or. had elevated rates of post transplantation relapse and nonrelapse mortality. This was especially true in the highest DIPSS plus risk group.
812,High dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard of care in the treatment of multiple myeloma . Resistance to MEL has been linked to increased DNA repair . Here we sought to identify whether inhibition of poly polymerase synergizes with MEL and can overcome resistance . We tested the synergistic cytotoxicity of 3 inhibitors of PARP veliparib olaparib and niraparib combined with MEL in RPMI8226 and U266 MM cell lines as well as in their MEL resistance counterparts RPMI8226 LR5 and U266 LR6 . The addition of VEL OLA and NIRA to MEL reduced the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC,Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 PARP1 inhibition in myeloma cells results in synergistic cytotoxicity with melphalan in vitro and in vivo. PARP1 inhibition cannot completely overcome resistance to melphalan which appears to be due to up regulated homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining. Expression of. and. predict outcomes in myeloma patients treated with tandem autologous stem cell transplantation.
813,Sickle cell disease affects 100 000 Americans and causes significant psychiatric illness and poor quality of life in many domains including infertility . Hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only available cure for SCD but it can entail chronic toxicities including psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety and sterility in both men and women . There is scant literature on fertility or psychiatric outcomes for patients with SCD receiving HCT and none considering the additive ramifications of the stresses of SCD transplantation and infertility . Financial toxicity is a significant concern for all patients undergoing HCT . Treatment for infertility is also very expensive and access to fertility services is variable in the United States adding to the medical and quality of life burden for this patient population . Here we review the relevant areas of SCD and infertility SCD and psychiatric wellness access to care and infertility and quality of life . Collectively these data suggest that the group of patients with SCD who undergo HCT and experience infertility are at particularly high risk for poor quality of life worsening psychiatric health and poor access to adequate fertility treatment .,Sickle cell disease SCD and its treatments especially alkylating agents and radiation used in hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT are damaging to fertility in both men and women. Patients with SCD face multiple factors contributing to poor quality of life and have high rates of depression which infertility may compound. Fertility preserving treatments are variably accessible and often very expensive. Researchers and clinicians have important roles in advocating for patients with SCD in general and in particular for the subset facing iatrogenic infertility due to HCT.

This paper reviews the literature describing our current knowledge of and possible mechanisms causing clinically significant bradyarrhythmia in horses .,Pathological bradyarrhythmias are rare in the horse. In many cases the cause is obscure. Diagnosis is usually obvious on resting ECG some cases require pharmacologic or exercise testing. Medical treatments include symptomatic and presumed etiologic therapy. In cases with persistent signs pacemakers provide good long term prognosis.
815,The neurotransmitter Substance P and its neurokinin 1 receptor are involved in the regulation of many pathophysiological processes including emesis inflammation and nociceptive processing . This review provides a brief summary of the anti inflammatory and analgesic properties of experimental NK 1R antagonists followed by a systematic review and meta analysis on maropitant the only NK 1R antagonist with a label indication for emesis in veterinary patients . There is very limited evidence based information on the putative clinical utilisation of maropitant for pain and inflammation . The aim of this systematic review and meta analysis was to evaluate published reports on anti inflammatory analgesic and anaesthesia sparing effects of maropitant . Medline Pubmed Science direct and Web of Science were searched to identify all published studies on maropitant followed by a meta analysis .,Maropitant is a neurokinin 1 antagonist with veterinary approval for emesis. Blocking the neurokin 1 receptor may cause analgesic and anti inflammatory effects. Meta analyses examined analgesic and anti inflammatory effects of maropitant. Maropitant significantly reduced minimum alveolar concentrations for anaesthetics. Maropitant had no significant analgesic or anti inflammatory effects.
816,D dimer is a peptide found in serum and is derived from the degradation of blood clots . Even though it has been analysed in human saliva D dimer has not been previously evaluated in the saliva of any veterinary species and its source and role remain unknown . The objectives of this research were firstly to validate the use of an automated method for the measurement of D dimer in porcine saliva and secondly to evaluate whether D dimer concentration changes in pig saliva after an acute stress stimulus . For this purpose a complete analytical validation of a commercially available immunoturbidimetric assay was carried out . In addition an experimental acute stress model was induced in 11 pigs based on a technique involving restraint by nose snare immobilisation for 1 min . Saliva samples were subsequently collected at different times and D dimer salivary alpha amylase and cortisol were assessed in order to evaluate changes in its concentrations after the stress induction .,D dimer was measured in porcine saliva with an automated immunoturbidimetric method. Acute stress induced by a nose snare significantly increased D dimer in pig saliva. A significant correlation between D dimer and alpha amylase was found.
817,This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chronic subclinical mastitis on milk production and component yields in dairy cows . A total of six herds located in the Midwest area of So Paulo State Brazil were selected . Herds were visited once every 2 weeks to measure milk yield and to collect milk samples from lactating Holstein cows . Milk samples were collected at two stages and each stage comprised three milk samplings . In stage 1 a total of 117 of 647 cows were diagnosed with CSM based on at least two of three repeated somatic cell counts 2000 000 cells mL and positive bacterial milk culture results . Cows with CSM were selected for the second stage . In stage 2 selected cows had quarter sampling aseptically collected for BC analyses prior to milking and quarter milk yield was measured . Milk components were measured using mid infrared spectroscopy . Mammary quarters were considered healthy if all three repeated SCC results were 200 000 cells mL and no bacterial growth was detected on BC . All quarters with positive bacterial growth were classified as having subclinical mastitis when only one of three SCC results were 200 000 cells mL and CSM when at least two of three SCC results were 200 000 cells mL . The effects of CSM by type of pathogen on milk and components yield were assessed using a linear mixed model .,Milk loss and composition alteration depended on the pathogen causing mastitis. Chronic quarters produced less milk than healthy quarters. Infection with environmental streptococci reduced milk production by 1.3kg quartermilking. Infection with. reduced milk production 0.8kg quartermilking. Chronically infected quarters were more severely affected than subclinical and healthy quarters.
818,The importance of atrial premature complexes as a possible marker of occult dilated cardiomyopathy in Doberman Pinschers is unknown . The aim of this study was to identify APC in healthy DP and to investigate their role as early markers of occult DCM . Holter ECG results from 561 examinations of 153 DP at different time points were retrospectively evaluated with special emphasis on APCs . Holter results from 110 healthy control DPs were compared to the last normal Holter and echocardiographic examinations in 43 DP that subsequently developed DCM within 15 months and to the first examination in the DCM group that contained ventricular premature complexes .,The presence of atrial premature complexes APCs can be normal in Doberman Pinschers. APCs occur more frequently in older dogs than in younger dogs. Extracardiac diseases can influence the presence of atrial premature complexes. APCs do not increase in frequency until the dogs also have ventricular arrhythmias.
819,Ventricular arrhythmias are often incidental or coincidental with systemic disease . Ventricular arrhythmias are also the most likely cause of many sudden cardiac deaths in horses . This dichotomy creates challenges in the management of horses with VAs . This review presents current knowledge of diagnosis prognosis and treatment of VAs in horses .,Ventricular arrhythmias VA are often incidental or coincidental with systemic disease. Ventricular arrhythmias are also the most likely cause of many sudden cardiac deaths in horses. This review presents current knowledge of diagnosis prognosis and treatment of VA in horses.

Phagocytosis of opsonized,Immune function and serum vitamin D concentrations was assessed in shelter dogs. Shelter dogs had decreased phagocytic oxidative burst function compared to controls. Serum vitamin D was weakly associated with the intensity of oxidative burst. Serum vitamin D was moderately inversely associated with TNF production.
821,Portosystemic shunts are congenital or acquired vascular anomalies that cause blood to bypass the liver . Liver function tests such as fasting ammonia ammonia tolerance test and serum bile acids are reliable for the diagnosis of PSS in dogs . Surgical attenuation is a common treatment for congenital PSS . Following surgical attenuation it is useful to evaluate shunt closure . In this critical review the ability of liver function tests to determine the presence and degree of residual shunting following surgical attenuation of canine PSS is discussed . Despite the availability of several liver function tests a single rapid simple cost effective sensitive and specific test to evaluate surgical attenuation of PSS is not available .,Advanced medical imaging can be used to assess portosystemic shunt PSS closure. Limited data exist regarding accuracy of liver function tests following PSS closure. No reference standard exists to assess the presence and degree of residual shunting.
822,A randomised controlled trial was carried out in four dairy herds located in the UK to evaluate the effect of pegbovigrastim treatment on the incidence of antimicrobial treatments during the first 30 d of lactation . Medical treatment records were analysed and treatments identified where an antibiotic product was used . Records were available for 1865 cows 933 of which received two injections of pegbovigrastim given approximately 14 d prior to expected calving and again within 24 h of calving . 932 cows received no treatment . In total 11.6,Incidence of early lactation antibiotic treatment in dairy cows was investigated. Treatment with pegbovigrastim reduced antibiotic use in early lactation. On well managed dairies the incidence of antibiotic treatment in early lactation was low. Complex management and environmental effects on immune function require further investigation.
823,Thus far there is a lack of scientific investigation regarding the hypothesis that biomechanical factors contribute to the cross species pathogenesis of osteochondrosis . Therefore the aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether high pressures occur in the porcine femorotibial joint . In this experimental ex vivo study the right hind limbs of seven weaned piglets were subjected to maximal joint excursions as a priori radiologically estimated . Subsequently the intra articular pressures were measured using sensors placed in both the medial and the lateral compartments of the FT joint .,Ex vivo study on intra articular pressures in the medial and lateral part of the porcine femorotibial joint. Maximal joint excursions were related to peak pressures in femorotibial joints of weaned piglets. Peak pressures above thresholds for matrix and vascular damage may result in osteochondrosis. This study provides preliminary information to develop specific preventive strategies for osteochondrosis.
824,The cessation of milking at the end of lactation is a routine management practice in dairy herds and the importance of the dry period for milk production and udder health has long been recognized . Among countries and herds drying off practices differ and include various milk cessation methods such as changes in milking frequency and in feeding the use of antibiotic dry cow therapy and teat sealants and changes in housing . Published studies reporting methods of stopping milk production are scarce and there are no uniform recommendations on optimal procedures to dry cows off for good udder health cow welfare and milk production . This review describes methods to stop mik production to prepare cows for the dry period and their effects on mammary involution udder health and dairy cow welfare . Milk yield at dry off is important for rapid involution which stimulates the immune system and promotes good udder health and cow welfare . Based on the findings of this review gradual cessation of milking over several days before the final milking can effectively reduce milk yield at dry off and accelerate mammary gland involution while maximizing cow comfort and welfare . Data from this review indicate a target production level of 15 kg day of milk or less at dry off .,High milk yield at dry off increases the risk of milk leakage and intramammary infections. Gradual cessation of milking at the end of lactation lowers milk yield at dry off. Gradual cessation of milking accelerates mammary involution and elevates natural protective factors in mammary secretions. Gradual cessation of milking reduces intramammary pressure stress and discomfort after dry off and improves cow welfare. Target production level at dry off should be 15 kg d of milk or less.

826,Throughout the ages humans have selected different horse breeds for their locomotor capacities . Consequently the properties of equine locomotor tissues could have diversified because of the specific requirements of different disciplines . Therefore this study aimed to compare biochemical properties of tendons in different equine breeds traditionally selected for racing or sports performance . We hypothesised that tendons in racing breeds would have biochemical properties that would increase strength whereas those in sporting breeds would have more elastic properties . An ex vivo tendon tissue study comparing the common digital extensor tendon and superficial digital flexor tendon of sports horses and racehorses was performed . The SDFT and CDET from middle aged Friesian,Biochemical comparison of equine superficial digital flexor tendons and common digital extensor tendons. Thoroughbred racehorses and sports horses Friesian and Warmblood horses were compared. Sports horses had lower tendon collagen concentrations than Thoroughbreds but higher water content and crosslink concentrations. Fibrillar collagen support predominates in Thoroughbreds crosslink collagen support predominates in sports horses. The observed biochemical differences between breeds could be related to their intended locomotor performance.
827,Endometrial cytobrush cytology has been recommended as a reliable method for determining the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in cattle smears to diagnose cytological endometritis . In this study the clarity of cytobrushcytological smears and the influence of different sample evaluation methods on CE diagnosis were evaluated . Samples from 28 lactatingHolstein cows were collected weekly between 3 and 7 weeks postpartum . Smear clarity based on cell density quality of cell morphology and red blood cell contamination was significantly poorer at 3 weeks than between 5 and 7 weeks postpartum . Fivedifferent cell counting methods were used where 100500 nucleated cells were counted . Agreement of diagnostic results for CE between C300 and C500 and between C400 and C500 was excellent at all observation times . In calculations of the PMN based on whether the number of lymphocytes and macrophages were or were not excluded in the denominator exclusion of these cells in the calculations did not affect the diagnosis of CE . While reduced clarity in earlier stage samples might interfere with the accuracy of cytobrush cytology C300 can be recommended to determine the endometrial PMN .,Cytological endometritis CE causes subfertility in lactating dairy cows. Cytobrush cytology CC has been recommended for diagnosing CE. A sequential description of CC during the early postpartum period is needed. Early 3 weeks postpartum smear clarity was reduced affecting the accuracy of CC. Counting 300 cells is recommended for diagnosing CE at 37 weeks postpartum.

Left ventricular early inflow outflow index LVEIO was predictive for CHF. LVEIO and L waves might be useful clinical and prognostic markers.
829,Minimally invasive catheter based interventional cardiology is a mainstay for the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias in human medicine . Very accurate imaging using fluoroscopy CT and MRI is essential during interventional cardiology procedures . Because these imaging techniques are either not possible or provide too little anatomical detail in horses echocardiography is currently the best technique to visualize catheters in horses . Over the past decades catheter based techniques have been applied to induce arrhythmias using pacing and to perform arrhythmia research using electrophysiological studies . In bradycardic animals with clinical signs permanent pacing can be achieved by pacemaker implantation via the cephalic vein . Transvenous electrical cardioversion based on one cardioversion catheter in the pulmonary artery and one in the right atrium has become the treatment of choice for atrial fibrillation in horses even for longstanding or drug resistant atrial fibrillation . Recently the highly advanced technique of three dimensional electroanatomical mapping has been described in horses . This technique has not only revealed essential electrophysiological data in horses but has also facilitated the successful ablation of atrial tachycardia in horses .,Temporary or permanent pacemaker pacing can be used in horses. Cardiac pacing and sensing are the cornerstones of electrophysiological studies. Three dimensional electro anatomical mapping can identify the precise mechanism of arrhythmia. Radiofrequency ablation of arrhythmias can be performed in adult horses. Transvenous electrical shock is an effective treatment for equine atrial fibrillation.

Most components of adrenal function tests offered little value in diagnosis. Calculated parts of adrenal function tests can help exclude adrenocortical tumors.
831,Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses with a reported prevalence up to 2.5 . The pathophysiology has mainly been investigated in experimental animal models and human medicine with limited studies in horses . Atrial fibrillation results from the interplay between electrical triggers and a susceptible substrate . Triggers consist of atrial premature depolarizations due to altered automaticity or triggered activity or local reentry . The arrhythmia is promoted by atrial myocardial ion channel alterations Ca,Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses. Atrial fibrillation results from focal ectopy combined with a susceptible substrate. Predisposing factors include chronic stretch and ion channel alterations. The arrhythmia results in atrial remodelling promoting maintenance of fibrillation. Time taken for reverse remodelling after cardioversion depends on duration of AF.

The distribution of principal strain and displacement in the modelling are consistent with the results obtained from Digital Image Correlation and Micro X ray Computed Tomography . It suggests that the avoidance of fibre breakage and the overlap of printed materials around the hole can dramatically increase the failure strength and prevent the propagation of cracks .,Finite element models for 3D printed woven CFRP composites with holes were established. Tailored fibre placement to leave a hole was considered and compared with traditional drilling method. Avoidance of fibre breakage and overlap of printed materials increase the strength and prevent the propagation of cracks.

837,Flame retardant and smoke suppressant expanded polystyrene foams were prepared by coating a mixture of thermoplastic phenolic resin and aluminum hypophosphite or expandable graphene onto EPS spheres . The PF reacting with AP by hydrogen bond interaction formed a facile flame retardant coating PF AP which not only greatly reduced flammability and smoke release but also remained the thermal conductivities of EPS foams at low level . Compared with those of EPS PF EG EPS PF AP could pass the UL 94 test and showed better flame retardant performances with lower heat release rates and fire growth rates . Especially the time to ignition of EPS PF AP achieved 52s much higher than those of EPS PF EG and neat EPS . Also the peak of smoke production rate and the total smoke production of both composites were significantly reduced showing an excellent smoke suppressant performance . The mechanism analysis suggested that the PF AP coating could form a compact POC cross linked char layer and effectively protect the matrix from further combusting . Particularly the EPS PF AP had a higher compressive strength and lower thermal conductivity in comparison with EPS PF EG .

In this work the effects of adding a small quantity of high molecular weight polycaprolactam on the crystal transformation melt viscoelasticity molecular orientation and mechanical properties of HSPA6 fibers were systematically investigated . The results indicated that HmwPA increased the elastic modulus and loss modulus of HSPA6 melt and suppressed molecular relaxation during drawing to form a crystal structure dominated by form . As such the tensile strength and elongation at break of HSPA6 fiber reached 10.32 cN dtex and 18.7 respectively . 1D and 2D wide angle X ray diffraction small angle X ray scattering and birefringence observations demonstrated that the HmwPA not only inhibited the destruction of the crystal structure during fiber drawing but also increased the molecular orientation in the amorphous region from 63.1 to 70.1 while maintaining the crystal orientation to about 95 .,The molecular chain orientation is improved by entanglements.

Close connection between O NiCoP and rGO to increase conductivity and enhanced electron transport rate. It is proved by Density functional theory DFT calculations that phosphating and introducing rGO can eliminate band gap and accumulate charge.

Graded foams with different gradients and uniform foams with different relative densities are fabricated by the additive manufacturing technique . Experimental results indicate that the gradient distribution notably influences the mechanical properties of foams under a low velocity impact . If the lowest density region is close to one end of a specimen this end will present a gradually increasing plateau stage in the stress strain curve . While if the highest density region is placed to one end this end will exhibit a sharp fluctuation before the gradually increasing plateau stage . Besides the crushing behaviors of graded and uniform foams are compared to propose an elastic collapse plastic hardening densification constitutive model . The E C PH D model can predict the dynamic mechanical properties of graded foams with successive layered deformation . A high velocity impact study is also carried out by the numerical simulation . The impact end of graded foams shows distinct higher stresses than the support end due to the shock wave effect . The combined effects of gradient and shock wave on the crushing responses of foams are discussed systematically .,The dynamic responses of continuous graded foams are investigated experimentally and numerically. Under the 20 m s impact the gradient distribution notably influences the mechanical properties of graded foams.

861,Graphitization is an important post treatment of carbon carbon composites . Carbon nanotubes as a means of reinforcement have been explored extensively in C C composites . In this study CNTs were grafted on the carbon fiber and subsequently densified to delve into the effect of CNT on microstructure residual thermal stress evolution as well as the mechanical strength retention rate in the course of the heat treatment . Pure C C and CNT C C composites were heat treated at three temperatures namely 1600C 2100C and 2450C .

CNT noticeably mitigated the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties they also reduced the effect on the anisotropy of mechanical properties . By impacting the microstructure and residual thermal stress distribution of the composites CNT had further effects on the loading capacity and fracture mode and finally protected the composites during the high temperature heat treatment and up regulated the MSR of CNT C C composites .,CNT accelerate the transition of PyC from turbostratic structure to ideal graphite structure. CNT refined PyC matrix contributes to high anti destructive capability which helps composites maintain the integrity and continuity of the composites even after heat treatment. Residual thermal stress was measured by Raman scattering intensity contour map and calculated by finite element analysis. The introducing of CNT reduces the anisotropic of PyC which results in a small and even distribution of residual thermal stress and avoids the destruction of PyC matrix during the heat treatment. In CNT C C composites integrity composites structure accompanied with lower and evenly distributed residual thermal stress leads to higher MSR. Compared with pure C C composites both matrix and fiber dominated properties have been enhanced after heat treatment in CNT C C composites which means CNT can effectively mitigate the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties and inhibit the effect on the mechanical properties anisotropy.

In the last decade the durability of BFRP bars has been the concern of the researchers however the effect of bar size or diameter have not yet been addressed . This paper investigates the effect of bar size on the physical mechanical and durability characteristics of newly developed sand coated BFRP bars conditioned for 3monthsat 60C in an alkaline solution simulating a concrete environment . Five diameters of BFRP bars were investigated before and after conditioning . In addition the microstructure of the BFRP barsboth conditioned and unconditioned specimenswas investigated with scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to assess any changes or degradation . The results revealed that the physical and mechanical properties of the reference BFRP bars were significantly affected by the cross sectional size of the bar . The higher probability of defects contained in the larger diameter bars may have caused the lower interlaminar and transverse shear strength and flexural strength in comparison to the smaller diameter bars .

914,The interface between magnetic particles and polymer matrix is a key factor for the structural and actuation properties of magneto composites . Herein we present a functionalisation method for carbonyl iron particles using epoxy silane . Experimental results from mechanical and electromagnetic tests reveal that this functionalisation increases the stiffness fracture toughness and induction heating rates compared to composites with unfunctionalised particles . It was found that these performance improvements stem from the increase in interface bond strength by the silane functionalisation which enables the polymer composites to sustain thermal loading without disbonding . The improved bonding between the magnetic particles and the matrix substantially enhances the actuation performance of the magneto composites . To demonstrate the potential of the magneto polymer composites a novel thermal bimorph actuator was designed manufactured and characterised for reaction load and deflection control .,An epoxy silane functionalisation method for carbonyl iron particles is presented.

915,The paper analyzes the records of the magnetic components of the Schumann resonance signals obtained at the Ukrainian Antarctic station Akademik Vernadsky from March 2002 to March 2019 and at Svalbard in the Arctic from October 2013 to June 2019 . The time course is studied of the monthly average intensities and peak frequencies of the first Schumann resonance maximum as well as the background noise intensity at the first minimum . Both observed parameters demonstrate periodic seasonal variations . The intensities are in phase in different hemispheres while the peak frequencies are in anti phase . Another feature of the resonance signals is interannual trend of the resonance intensity and peak frequency observed in both hemispheres being synchronous with 11 year solar cycle . The background noise intensities demonstrate the absence of appreciable interannual variations . We propose the following interpretation of these results . Seasonal changes in peak frequencies are determined by the regular meridian drift of the world thunderstorm centers up to in latitude from the equator . Seasonal variations of the intensity are controlled by changes of thunderstorm activity that increase of about 1.5 times during the boreal summer compared with the winter . World thunderstorm activity is practically independent on the phase of the solar cycle . The observed interannual trends in the parameters of the first Schumann mode are determined by the global changes in the lower ionosphere . They can be explained by increasing of the upper characteristic height by 23km due to additional ionization during the years of maximum solar activity . Another explanation might be an increase of the lower characteristic height by 11.5km during the years of the quiet Sun due to variation of the flux of galactic cosmic rays . Moreover we showed that involvement of ionosphere conductivity profiles in the point source model accounting their seasonal drift provides reliable estimating the global thunderstorms centers activities . To explain a behavior of the intensity changes recorded in the Antarctic observatory a mechanism of additional modulation of the local resonant cavity parameters within the solar cycle is required .,First mode Schumann intensities and peak frequencies show interannual variations. Interannual Schumann variations in both hemispheres are synchronous with solar cycle. Intensity in first Schumann resonance minimum demonstrate no interannual variation. Schumann signals show periodic seasonal variations independent on the solar cycle. Schumann intensity are in phase peak frequency in anti phase in different hemispheres.
916,In this study we examine distributions of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Asian Summer Monsoon anticyclone during summer using thirteen years of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder observations . We also present the role of tropical tropopause and ocean atmosphere interactions in controlling the UTLS water vapor over the ASM anticyclone region . Water vapor accumulated inside the central part of ASM anticyclone is primarily transported from the low latitude oceanic region and very less amount of water vapor is pumped directly from the lower to the upper troposphere . It is concluded water vapor in the UTLS region inside the central part of ASM anticyclone is mostly controlled by horizontal advection and very less from the local process and tropopause temperature in both summer and winter . The tropopause altitude is highest and the pressure is lowest inside the central part of ASM anticyclone as compared to the other tropical ASM regions during summer . In addition there is an increase of 11.3 ppmb water vapor along with the warm tropopause in the UTLS region during El Nio events over the entire ASM region however more water vapor is observed over the southern part of ASM region .

917,We present a simple efficient and flexible three dimensional electrostatic model for calculating the magnitude and direction of the electric field from the ground to the base of the ionosphere for a given thunderstorm charge configuration with the aim of evaluating the possibility for sprite inception . The model is based on a method of images solution to Poisson s equation assuming near vacuum conditions and with perfectly conducting upper and lower boundaries . A dipole electrical structure within each thundercloud is assumed with a screening charge above the cloud . The charge centers are modeled with average structural characteristics of summer and winter thunderstorms . To simulate a positive or negative cloud to ground lightning discharge the main positive or main negative charge center respectively is removed from the domain . The computed electric potential at each grid point is converted to the electric field and is compared against the value of the conventional breakdown field to obtain an indication of the possibility of electrical breakdown and hence the possibility of sprite inception . This simple model is particularly useful for performing a sensitivity study with respect to variation in thunderstorm cell charge configuration with no assumption of symmetry in the horizontal or vertical directions . Implications of the presence of neighboring clouds at different relative stages of development on the possibility of sprite inception and on the displacement of sprites from the location of the parent thunderstorm are also examined as well as clouds with inverted dipole charge configuration .,The method of images can be easily used to map areas of possible sprite inception. Neighboring clouds can significantly affect the area of possible sprite inception. The influence of horizontally asymmetric charge configurations should be investigated further including time dependence.

At high levels of ionospheric disturbance the AATR is proportional to the WTEC. Higher sensitivity of the WTEC to disturbances at midlatitudes is shown.
920,To perform network RTK positioning a user must receive and apply the information generated from a network . Corrections are generated for the user to consider the atmospheric delays between ther location and the network stations . In order to generate reliable corrections and send them to users one must resolve the ambiguities in the processing step of the network stations . Ambiguities are the number of integer cycles of the carrier phase in the first data collection epoch and are introduced as parameters to be estimated in the processing . Thus the ambiguity resolution process becomes a prerequisite for obtaining high accuracy in network RTK positioning . This process can be divided into two steps estimation and validation . The estimation step aims to obtain the integer values of ambiguities and in the validation step it is inferred if the estimated integer value may or may not be accepted . In this work the LAMBDA method was used to obtain the integer ambiguity estimate and for the validation the Ratio and FF RT tests were used . The objective of this work was to investigate the performance of the ambiguities validation tests for long baselines . The results showed that the FF RT test presented the highest fixed ambiguity percentages when compared to the Ratio test in all analyzed periods . Thus for long baselines positioning in periods of either weak or strong ionospheric activity the use of the FF RT test will cause a greater number of fixed ambiguities to be used in the process of generating the corrections for the user .,Evaluation of ionospheric activity effects on GNSS ambiguity resolution.

Results of the inverse problem solution are addressed as well . It is shown that relative variations of NLC brightness are mainly dependent on the amplitude of a gravity wave its horizontal wavelength and unperturbed thickness of an NLC layer . It is also shown that the model can be used for determining a geometric amplitude of a perturbing wave from a relative brightness distribution and that the uncertainty of the geometric wave amplitude is mainly defined by an uncertainty of the cloud layer thickness .,Undulation of the top and bottom of a noctilucent cloud layer causes waves in its brightness field. This effect alone may account for main features of observing brightness field. Geometrical undulation amplitude can be estimated from a known brightness amplitude. Estimation uncertainty is determined mainly by an unknown width of a cloud layer.

923,Over the last few decades it has been shown in numerous studies using different observational approaches that although less frequent lightning over the oceans is significantly more intense than over land . To study this difference we set up a laboratory experiment in which we examined the flash intensity of generated lightning strikes as a function of the salinity of the water into which they were discharged . Our experiments clearly showed that the intensity of lightning increased exponentially with the concentration of dissolved salts in the water . We hypothesize that the higher conductivity of the saline water compared to moist soil results in a more efficient charge transfer to the surface resulting in larger peak current discharges and brighter optical flashes .,This paper sheds light on the mystery around why lightning discharges over the oceans are more intense than those over the continents. Many studies have shown more intense lightning over oceans Although even though the amount of lightning over oceans is only around 10 of the global activity. We show that the salinity of the oceans plays and important role in the intensity of the lightning discharges in the atmosphere.

The migrating diurnal tide estimated from Sounding of Atmosphere by Broadband Emission Radiometry temperature at 8090km shows larger amplitudes in March than in September in 2008 and 2011 but comparable amplitudes in both March and September during 2015 . This suggests the major role of the DW1 in driving the large westward winds .,Equatorial mesospheric mean zonal wind is equinox asymmetric in strong La Nia year.

929,An improved stochastic method for computer simulation of lightning leaders is developed based on the results from optical observation data . The development and attachment process of downward negative cloud to ground lightning in the near ground area is simulated . The distribution of lightning strike points influenced by tall structures is statistically analyzed . The results show that when downward negative leaders initiate at 1500m height over a structure the relative strike frequency for the structure increases at a decreasing rate as the structure height increases . The strike frequency for a 600m tall structure is approximately 3.6 times that for a 100m tall structure . Additionally the structure may attract some lightning to hit itself and shift nearby ground strike points toward the structure . For taller structures the deviation effect is more apparent . It is stipulated in this study that if the ground strike density in the vicinity of the structure is no more than 5 of the average density then the structure has a sufficient protective effect on this area . The data indicate that there is a positive correlation between the protection distance and the height of the structure . The protection distances of structures of 100600m in height are 200m 280m 350m 400m 450m and 480m approximatively which show a declining rate of increase .,A stochastic lightning leader model was improved to simulate the effects of tall structures on downward lightning.

930,An extreme rainfall event that made major calamity over the Indian peninsula region has been investigated with a focus on the physics of the cloud system as indicated from the multi satellite observations ground based radar and model forecast experiments . The vertical structure of clouds showed deep convective cores embedded in the stratiform and is dominated by warm and mixed phase clouds . Model output indicates that moisture convergence was present in two episodes before both heavy rainfall events and can be used as a precursor for the imminent heavy rainfall . It is the sustenance of high winds and availability of moisture content that contributed to the development of deep convective cloud bands which propagated inland perpendicular to the coastline . These cloud systems produced deep convective cores with a deep supersaturated layer throughout the middle and upper atmosphere introduced a significant amount of supercooled liquid water which facilitated mixed phase clouds . These cloud liquid drops at supercooled temperatures facilitated the production of more ice hydrometeors on freezing . The rapid growth of hydrometeors through riming and aggregation in the mixed phase region lead to heavy and sustained precipitation . The sustenance of the system is also due to the enhanced latent heating over Western Ghats that supported low level moisture convergence in a strongly sheared environment . Documented evidence from this study suggests that the heavy precipitation was a result of the convective cluster as illustrated through satellite observations and numerical simulations .,Physics of cloud systems associated with heavy rainfall event in a coastal location Kerala.

Various dry and wet periods are closely associated with the activity of this system during the rainy season as well . The present study evaluated the changes in Sudan low area during four decades which were classified based on solar cycles . The data obtained from the Meteorological Organization of Iran included daily precipitation daily rainfall from the ECMWF dataset with 1 1 spatial resolution sea level pressure and geopotential height at 1000 hPa pressure level from NCEP NCAR dataset with 2.5 2.5 spatial resolution starting and ending in March 1976 and December 2017 respectively . In addition Sudan low pressure systems were selected by navigating the route and the location trajectory of low pressure systems in SLP and the 1000 hPa pressure level maps of the rainfall days . Accordingly 160 Sudan systems were selected using the internal self assessment method . Further the impact of the rainfall system in Iran was studied utilizing the rainfall maps of ECMWF dataset . The results revealed that the sphere of the influence of the Sudan low increased during the rainy season over time . Within this period changes in the areas of influence of the Sudan system remained constant only in February compared to the last two decades while the solar cycles added to the Sudan systems in the other months of the cold spell . This result could be due to a climate change in the direction of the solar activity in the climate of Iran .,Frontal rainfalls had a significant role in the rainfall rate of other parts of the Iran. The survey of 313 synoptic stations in Iran in four solar cycles 1976 2017 revealed that the influence domain of this system on Iran is increasing while Sudan rainfall territory remained constant only in February.
932,Water vapor is the most variable constituent in the atmosphere and plays an important role in climate studies mesoscale meteorology modeling and numerical weather forecasting . Being able to penetrate clouds interferometric synthetic aperture radar shows great potential in atmospheric water vapor mapping . But InSAR can only measure differential water vapor between two acquisitions . In this paper we formulate a general framework by constructing the Gauss Markov model and developing the estimation method to retrieve the non differential water vapor from Small BAseline Subset InSAR . To address the rank deficiency in the Gauss Markov model we propose a new constraint i.e . the temporal mean of water vapor being invariant . Simulated and real data experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework and the advantages of the proposed constraint . The results show that the new constraint can offer an estimation more robust than the two traditional ones i.e . the temporal mean of water vapor being zero and single or multiple epoch water vapor referencing . In addition we found that there exists a constant bias which equals to the temporal mean of water vapors between the solutions under the new constraint and that under the constraint of the temporal mean of water vapor being zero . Finally the possible methods to evaluate the temporal mean of water vapor are discussed .,Formulating a general framework and developing the estimation method to retrieve the non differential PWV from TS InSAR.

933,The I3RC Community Monte Carlo model of three dimensional radiative transfer was improved by allowing the specification of surfaces with variable albedo . A series of simulations were performed using the improved I3RC CM in order to investigate the role of surface albedo heterogeneity in shortwave radiation transfer under 3D clouds . For the same regionally averaged surface albedo of 0.25 the top of atmosphere reflectivity was found to vary by approximately 10,The original I3RC CM was improved by adding artificially specified surfaces with variable albedos. The different surface albedo patterns for the same regional average of 0.25 can lead to a deviation with a 10. order of magnitude in TOA reflectivity. The inhomogeneous surface albedo was discovered to have a greater impact on TOA reflectivity at the non absorbing wavelengths. Surface albedo heterogeneity s influence on cloud absorptance was revealed to be stronger at a wavelength of 1.64m than at 2.13m.
934,Using large data base of stable auroral arcs observed at Gillam we identified those passes of POES spacecraft which were magnetically conjugate to these arcs . We studied statistically arc locations with respect to the energetic particle isotropy boundaries which are the well known markers of the magnetotail regions . In the dusk and night sectors we confirm previous finding that arcs tend to appear close to or poleward of the electron isotropy boundary IB,Dusk to midnight arcs appear poleward of the electron isotropy boundary IBe in the low Bz current sheet region. Many dawnside arcs appear between electron and proton IBs in the transition region between current sheet and dipole. Nearly tail aligned structures are rotated toward azimuthal alignment when mapped from tail equator to the ionosphere. Fast flow convection channels BBFs may serve as viable framework to explain a significant fraction of auroral arcs.

By adopting the moving median method the ionospheric electron density detected by the Langmuir probe onboard CSES presented remarkable enhancements along the orbits 2660 0 on July 27 2721 0 and 2728 1 on July 31 2827 0 and 2735 1 on August 7 2934 0 on August 14 respectively which were just 1 5 2 and 5 days before the four earthquakes . Moreover the disturbances mainly appeared in the north and north east within the distance of 2000km from each epicenter . By comparing the disturbed orbits with their corresponding four nearest and four revisiting orbits as well as the predicted values from the International Reference Ionosphere 2016 model the results powerfully illustrated that CSES observed the ionospheric precursors preceding the four Indonesian earthquakes . To make the space borne results more convincing we further studied the grid total electron content data from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe which exhibited similar anomalies in both the temporal and spatial distributions . In the end the superposed epoch analyses method was conducted on 35M5.8 depth50km earthquakes in Indonesia during 20072017 by using CODE TEC . The statistical results demonstrated that there were significant positive anomalies 17 days before earthquakes within 2000km from the epicenters in this region . The positive plasma perturbations detected by CSES were highly suggested as the seismic ionospheric effects before earthquakes .,The seismic ionospheric effects in Indonesian region detected by the CSES satellite are investigated. The accuracy of the CSES derived results are verifiedby the IRI model and GIM TEC datasets. It is suggested that there are four pre earthquake Ne anomalies just corresponding to four earthquakes.
938,Daytime oxygen airglow emission rate variability provides us with a means of remote investigations of the upper atmospheric behavior . Dayglow emission rates typically show a diurnal pattern with a peak at around noon especially during geomagnetic quiet conditions . The photochemical and empirical models show that the emission rates typically vary as a function of solar zenith angle and solar flux . Thus both larger solar flux magnitudes and smaller solar zenith angles contribute to larger dayglow emission rates as the yield of excited oxygen atoms is expected to be greater in those conditions . However variability in the annual dayglow emission rates obtained from measurements at low latitudes Hyderabad India 17,Annual OI 630.0nm dayglow emission rate variations over low and mid latitudes are presented. The dayglow emission variability at low and equatorial latitudes primarily depends on solar zenith angle and solar flux. Mid latitude dayglow emission variability depends strongly on the variability of oxygen to molecular nitrogen ratio. O N. values are empirically simulated as a function of day of the year and latitude to assess the compositional variations.
939,European monthly temperatures undergo strong fluctuations from one year to the other . The variability is controlled by natural processes such as Atlantic cycles changes in solar activity volcanic eruptions unforced internal atmospheric variability as well as anthropogenic factors . This contribution investigates the role of key natural drivers for European temperature variability namely the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation the North Atlantic Oscillation and solar activity changes . We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients r for AMO NAO and sunspots compared to monthly temperature data of 39 European countries for the period 19012015 in order to search for fingerprints of the natural drivers . A cross correlation window of 11 months was chosen for AMO NAO and of 120 months for SILSO to account for possible time lags or phase shifts . The r coefficients were mapped out across Europe on a monthly basis to document regional and seasonal changes of the correlation strength . The NAO dominates European temperature variability during the winter months with strongest relationship in February . The AMO modulates temperatures in March to November with best correlations occurring in summer but also in April . Regions of strongest AMO and NAO impacts shift across the continent from month to month forming systematic patterns . Direct correlation of the solar 11 year Schwabe cycle with temperatures was identified only in some countries in certain multidecadal intervals during February March June and September . Previous studies have suggested a significant solar influence on the AMO and NAO . It is likely that the greatest impact of solar activity on European temperatures is of a non linear indirect nature by way of interaction with Atlantic cycles .,Correlation of AMO NAO and sunspots with European temperatures was studied for 19012015 based on correlation coefficients. Seasonal changes were mapped out with NAO dominating in winter and AMO in summer exhibiting systematic regional shifts. Direct solar correlations are regionally seasonally restricted greatest solar impact through interaction with NAO and AMO.
940,Long term variations in annual frequencies of occurrence of magnetic storms with sudden and gradual commencements were studied on the base of the data from IZMIRAN and Slutsk magnetic observatories for the period 18782015 . It was found that occurrences of strong and moderate magnetic storms with gradual commencements are characterized by a pronounced variability on the multidecadal time scale . Their wavelet spectra reveal strong periodicities of 36 years as well as less pronounced 60 year and 90 year ones throughout the entire time interval under study . The occurrences of strong moderate and weak magnetic storms with sudden commencements are characterized by dominating 11 year periodicities whereas long term variations are substantially weaker . The obtained results provide evidence for a different temporal evolution of local and global solar magnetic fields responsible for solar agents contributing to the development of these types of magnetic storms . The obtained results allow suggesting a possible contribution of solar geomagnetic activity to the formation of climatic oscillations on the multidecadal time scale .,Magnetic storms with sudden SC and gradual GC commencements show different temporal variability. Occurrence of SC magnetic storms is characterized by strong 11 year periodicity. Occurrence of GC magnetic storms reveals noticeable long term variations with periods from 30 to 100 years. Characteristic feature of GC storms is a dominant 36 year periodicity close to the Brckner cycle.
941,In addition to X rays extreme ultraviolet rays radiated from solar flares can cause serious problems such as communication failures and satellite drag . Therefore methods for forecasting EUV dynamic spectra during flares are urgently required . Recently however owing to the lack of instruments EUV dynamic spectra have rarely been observed . Hence we develop a new method that converts the soft X ray light curve observed during large flare events into an EUV dynamic spectrum by using the,A new method to convert a soft X ray light curve into an EUV dynamic spectrum during flares is presented. The conversion can be calculated via a numerical simulation and an atomic database. It succeeds in reconstructing some EUV peaks in the observed dynamic spectrum.
942,Atmospheric tides dominate the mesosphere and lower thermosphere dynamics and show seasonal interannual as well as long term variability . In the present study MLT wind data obtained between 1999 and 2019 from meteor radar observations at Cachoeira Paulista 22.7,Evolution of DT SDT TDT amplitudes at 22.7S during the declining phases of SC 23 and 24. Relationship of the behaviour of tidal amplitudes with the stratospheric QBO. Solar cycle signature in the variation of the SDT and TDT has been analysed.
943,This study is focused on investigating how well the day to day variability of HF propagation in the bottomside ionosphere can be simulated using a state of the art ionosphere model coupled to a whole atmosphere model driven by the lower atmosphere . The SAMI3 ionosphere model has been coupled to the WACCM X whole atmosphere model which was nudged with NAVGEM HA to incorporate the effects of lower atmospheric weather . The resulting ionospheric specifications were used as input for an HF propagation model in order to compare to observations from the NOAA ionosphere network . The results indicate that the amount of variability at the F region peak can be successfully reproduced by the model but that the simulations do not show enough variability in the bottomside of the F region particularly below 200km altitude . Further comparisons with data and a simple modeling study are used to demonstrate that the most likely source of this missing variability are low altitude ion transport terms which are not currently included in the standard SAMI3 model . These transport terms are required to simulate the motion perpendicular to the magnetic field in regions where the motion becomes strongly dominated by ion neutral collisions .,Simulations predict the amount of day to day variability in the F region ionosphere. Variance below 200km altitude is still not well represented in the model. Virtual height at a fixed frequency is a good metric for bottomside variability.
944,The ionospheric weather V index maps are generated from GIM TEC produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with the denser grids of 11 in latitude and longitude respectively . Using sliding window statistical analysis moving TEC median for 15 preceding days with estimated variance bounds is obtained for each grid pixel of GIM TEC . The ionosphere variability index V is TEC deviation from the median normalized by the standard deviation . V index segmentation is introduced specifying TEC storm if an instant TEC is outside the bound of 2 . Comparisons of V variability of 11 GIM TEC maps with normal GIM TECs of 2.55 in latitude and longitude demonstrates the greater TEC storm activity with denser grids maps . The superposed epoch analysis is performed for 77 intense storms and 246 moderate storms during 20002017 with zero time t,Superiority of denser global TEC maps 11 deg grids over standard IONEX GIM TECs is demonstrated. Hourly seasonal hierarchy is established with the positive TEC storms preceeding Dst storm echoed by the negative TEC storm. Storm Enhanced Density is dominant at Equatorial zone over North and South high latitude zones. Intensity of ionosphere storms is dropped by 35 times from intense to moderate Dst storms.
945,A Kohonen artificial neural network was used to classify patterns of causal relationships between the level of geomagnetic activity in the auroral zone and plasma and magnetic field parameters in the body of an interplanetary magnetic cloud . Terrestrial and satellite observations during 33rd interplanetary magnetic clouds recorded from 1998 to 2012 are examined in detail . Experiments with the ANN during its fast training show that substorm discrimination by their intensity by three classes plus a collector for collecting atypical events is optimal for the study . An analysis of the classification result studies showed that each selected class of substorms corresponds to a specific set of perturbations of the plasma parameters and the magnetic field of the IMO . Using the integral characteristics of the plasma and the IMF components as input parameters of the ANN allowed us to detect the levels of the expected intensity of the AL index with an accuracy of up to 70 . The created ANNs can be used to restore the AL index both during periods of isolated magnetospheric substorms and during periods of a series of continuous successive substorms one after another .,A neural network was used to classify causal relationships between geomagnetic activity and magnetic cloud parameters. Observations during 33rd interplanetary magnetic clouds recorded from 1998 to 2012 are examined in detail for this study. Results showed that each selected class of substorms corresponds to a specific set of disturbances of plasma parameters. reated neural networks can be used to restore the AL index with an truth of up to 70 both of isolated or series substorms.
946,An active mapping mission is described that unambiguously connects measurements in the Earth s magnetosphere to visible aurora in the atmosphere . The core of the mission is an electron beam source operated on a spacecraft in the equatorial magnetosphere with the electron beam traveling along the Earth s magnetic field lines to the atmosphere depositing its energy to create an optical beam spot in the atmosphere at the footpoint of the spacecraft s magnetic field line . This optical spot can be imaged by ground based cameras putting the location of the spacecraft s magnetic footpoint into the context of the optical aurora . Scientific instruments carried on the spacecraft make critical measurements of the properties of the magnetosphere at the locations where the magnetosphere powers the aurora allowing the determination of the plasma physics mechanisms by which the magnetosphere drives the aurora in particular answering the outstanding question of how the magnetosphere drives low latitude auroral arcs . Long standing questions in magnetosphere ionosphere coupling that have not been answered because we could not unambiguously connect locations in the magnetosphere with their image in the ionosphere will finally be addressed . In this paper the properties of a standard growth phase auroral arc are collected theories of the magnetospheric generation of auroral arcs are reviewed and critical magnetospheric measurements to discern the mechanisms that drive auroral arcs are determined . Further the plasma physics of the experiment is investigated including spacecraft charging mitigation beam stability beam scattering and electron orbit theory . Tradeoffs concerning the energy of the electron beam are enumerated .,A space experiment is designed to connect magnetospheric measurements to the aurora. The science focus is the generator mechanisms of auroral arcs. A standard growth phase auroral arc is described. Magnetospheric measurement requirements are listed. Technical issues with the experiment are examined.
947,Digital difference filters were used for the analysis of data of the spectral observations of the rotational temperature and emission intensity of vibrationally excited hydroxyl at altitudes 8590kmat observatories Zvenigorod for 20042016 years and Tory for 20122017 . The monthly average values and standard deviations of mesoscale perturbations of the OH emission characteristics with periods 0.811h are obtained . These mesoscale perturbations may reflect internal gravity waves in the mesopause region . To filter out mesoscale perturbations differences between the sequential values of the OH emission characteristics averaged over the intervals by duration from 0.5h to 2h were obtained . The average monthly variances of mesoscale perturbations in the OH rotational temperature obtained at Tory are larger compared to Zvenigorod ones . Average seasonal changes of relative mesoscale variances demonstrate maxima in winter and in summer with the summer maximum shifted closer to spring months for the Tory station . The reasons for the differences could be different orography and jet streams in the lower and middle atmosphere also different spectra of IGW horizontal wavelengths due to different geometry of observations at Tory and Zvenigorod .,Digital difference filters were used for the analysis of the OH nightglow spectral observations at two sites. Seasonal variations of mesoscale variances demonstrate maxima in winter and in summer. The variance was generally increasing in years 20082014 and decreasing after that.
948,Analytic theory developed in the companion paper in order to describe the coherence properties of the high frequency wave field propagating through the stochastic transionospheric channel with the inhomogeneous background layer and anisotropic fluctuations of the electron density is further analyzed extended and specified to obtain the numerical results which illustrate the fields coherence properties for realistic parameters of the channel and geometries of propagation .,Analytic relations from the companion paper are used to study coherence properties. Quantitative results are presented for spaced position and frequency coherency. Limiting cases of pure space and pure frequency coherences are available.
949,Rigorous analytic solution is constructed for the first of 2s order space position and frequency coherence function of the high frequency wave field propagating through the stochastic transionospheric channel with the inhomogeneous layer of the background ionosphere and anisotropic fluctuations of the electron density in the approximation of the appropriate Markov equation . It is obtained employing the anisotropic parabolic model of the effective structure function of the fractional electron density fluctuations with two different scales along and across the Earth s magnetic field . The explicit analytic solution is presented which is capable of describing the coherence properties of the field for any given inhomogeneous distribution of the electron density in the background ionosphere along a path of propagation . The procedure of calibrating the spatial scales of the anisotropic parabolic model of the electron density fluctuations along and across the Earth s magnetic field lines in order to provide the adequate solution to correspond to the realistic anisotropic inverse power law spectrum of the electron density fluctuations is presented in the companion paper .,Problem is considered in Markov parabolic approximation for coherency. Semi analytic model of the background ionosphere is introduced to solve the problem. Solution is expressed through known special functions.
950,Atmospheric phase screen is one of the main error sources of interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements . In order to accurately retrieve displacement fields it is necessary to use advanced methods to eliminate the tropospheric effect of interferograms . In this paper the land subsidence in Kurdistan province of Iran is investigated using Sentinel 1A acquisitions on a single track for the period 20142018 . The accurate and applicable 3D ray tracing technique is used to accurately estimate the APS . The ERA I reanalysis data generated by European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts are used to implement the 3D ray tracing technique . In order to determine the effect of using the 3D ray tracing technique the APSs are also determined using a traditional approach called spatiotemporal filters method . To evaluate the capability of the two methods the results are compared with the weather research and forecasting model model . Finally the interferograms are corrected using APSs from 3D ray tracing technique and traditional method and the subsidence rate in the study area is computed . Comparing the subsidence rates obtained from two APS estimation methods with piezometric data GPS and precise levelling observations shows that the 3D ray tracing technique is significantly more accurate than traditional method in computing InSAR displacement fields .,The first attempt to evaluate the efficiency of the 3D ray tracing tracking method in calculating the subsidence rate.

Comparing the subsidence rates obtained from two APS estimation methods with piezometric data GPS and precise levelling observations.
951,Aerosol plays an important role in the climate system by affecting the radiative and energy balances . Hence in this paper the spatial patterns of aerosol burden and aerosol optical properties in four the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models over East Asia during 20012005 are compared to quantify inter model differences and to evaluate AOD simulations against observations . The evaluation of AOD against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite retrievals shows that CMIP5 models can reproduce the spatial pattern of MODIS AOD reasonably well . The mean AOD over eastern China shows that NorESM1 M underestimates MODIS AOD by 40 due to the lack of emissions of some aerosol components such as nitrate biogenic aerosol and non desert mineral dust . In contrast to that CSIRO Mk3.6.0 overestimates annual mean of MODIS AOD over eastern China by 20 partially caused by larger aerosol emissions and burden . Compared to MODIS AOD GFDL CM3 performs the best in simulating AOD in eastern China because ammonium and nitrate are included in this model . The comparisons of CMIP5 and Aerosol Robotic Network AOD show similar results . In addition the simulated AOD values are closer to AERONET AOD in Mongolia China Japan and Korea than that in India . The results also reveal that there are some inter model differences of aerosol burden over East Asia caused by the inter model differences of aerosol emissions wet scavenging and transport . Over eastern and northwestern China and the west Pacific the inter model differences of anthropogenic aerosol burden and spatial variabilities are smaller than that of natural aerosol burden .,The evaluation results show that CMIP5 models can reproduce the spatial pattern of MODIS AOD reasonably well. Compared to MODIS AOD GFDL CM3 performs the best in simulating AOD in eastern China. The simulated AOD values are closer to AERONET AOD in Mongolia China Japan and Korea than that in India. The inter model differences of aerosol burden are caused by aerosol emissions wet scavenging and transport.
952,Atmospheric temperature has both variations with time constants of order year or longer such as trends annual and semiannual oscillation as well as variations with shorter time constants such as two day waves diurnal and semidiurnal tides and gravity waves . Long term amplitudes such as trends and solar flux variations have been determined from the time series of observed sodium lidar temperatures averaged over a night or a fixed 2 h interval by ignoring the short time scale variations . Since during the twenty eight years of the CSU USU sodium lidar experiments diurnal and semi diurnal temperature tides could be as much as 9K and 18K respectively it is particularly important to estimate their effects . We accept the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere and show that for linear models the tidal shift of trends depends upon the times of observations averages of the short time variations and the basis functions of the long time variations such as t sin and solar flux but not on observed temperatures . This allows planning experimental campaigns and analyses to reduce the tidal effects . We compare the tidal shifts of temperature trends and tidal shifts in the annual and semiannual amplitudes for CSU USU experiments using 2 h averages and nightly averages using data from all times during the year and those restricted to different seasons . For example the maximum tidal shifts in trends in temperatures winds and air density are predicted to occur at altitudes around 100km . For the CSU USU experiments the tidal shifts of temperature trends vary between 0 and 1.5K decade depending on altitude and annual seasonal data used between 85 and 100km they are much smaller for 2 h means than for nightly means .,Tidal shifts of long term trend for temperatures winds and densities are derived. Shifts depend on basis functions observations times and tides but not temperatures. Plan experimental observation times to minimize tidal effects on atmospheric trends. Compared shifts with the mesopause temperature trends observed over 28 years.
953,We report on a statistical study of prominence eruptions using a catalog of these events routinely imaged by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory in the 304 pass band . Using an algorithm developed as part of an LWS project we have detected PEs in 304 synoptic images with 2 min cadence since May 2010 . A catalog of these PEs is made available online,An algorithm to detect prominence eruptions PEs automatically has been developed. A catalog of the detected PEs is available online. While prominences are found in all latitudes the surges generally occur only in the active region belt. Shortly before the time of the polarity reversal the speed of the prominences becomes very small. High latitude PE speed decreased with the decreasing of the average polar magnetic field strength of the previous cycle.
954,Daily variations of the Atmospheric Electric Field allow to observe separately the atmospheric electricity due to global and local factors . Observations of the AEF are made for three different sites of Pakistan during fair weather conditions . These three sites are Islamabad Muzaffarabad and Balakot . Analyses of the diurnal variations of the atmospheric electric field for these sites are discussed in this paper with respect to annual and seasonal behavior . Muzaffarabad and Balakot sites show two daily maxima and Islamabad site shows single maxima characteristic of local influences such as the aerosol sunrise effect and Austausch effect or exchange layer effect . Later these results are compared globally with land based measurements available in the literature and with the Carnegie curve . Local effects found to be dominant among these sites with respect to one another due to geographical location climate and different meteorological parameters . This is the first different creation of the ISB MZF BKT database which will be very effective to improve the information of atmospheric electricity in the complex processes due to weather and climate . This database from Pakistan will be useful for the scientific community for further understating and investigation of the Global Electric Circuit .,We present the spatial temporal variation of the fair weather Atmospheric Electric Field AEF in Northern Pakistan. Local effects and influence of meteorological factors on the atmospheric electric field is observed. The AEF values are compared globally with the standard Carnegie curve and the land based stations. Lower values of the AEF are observed during monsoon than in winter season which may due to lesser amount of aerosol.
955,This study aims to model diurnal Land Surface Temperature on a local scale of an arid environment by utilizing the Artificial Neural Network and time series analysis of Landsat 8 satellite imageries . An arid region containing an in situ LST station located in Nevada United States was chosen as a test site . 78 Landsat 8 satellite imageries covering the test site were utilized to calculate spectral indexes . Since the spectral indexes represent the surface of Earth as land cover indexes they can be used as indicators that affect the LST . The relationship between ten spectral indexes and in situ LST were investigated and the highly correlated indexes were determined as Built up Area Extraction Index and Normalized Difference Bareness Index . The BAEI and NDBaI showed 0.80 and 0.94 correlation coefficients respectively with in situ LST . Those two indexes and meteorological data namely relative humidity and air temperature were used as inputs in the ANN model . A multi layer perceptron feed forward network was considered in this study . The ANN model presented highly accurate results in the training and testing process with Root Mean Square Error values 0.74K and 2.54K respectively . After learning and testing processes the weights and biases were extracted to form the mathematical equation of the ANN model and the equation was utilized to map LST for three data sets which were acquired during the winter and summer times and were not utilized in the ANN model . The results showed that the LST difference was lower than 1K with regard to wintertime LST images . However the LST difference was 2.49K in the summertime . To test the spatial variability of ANN based LST MODIS LST products were considered and ANN based LST was resampled to 1km the same resolution as the MODIS data for comparison . As a result of the comparison the highest mean LST difference between ANN based and MODIS LST was calculated as 1.1K . Although the proposed method tended to underestimate LST as it increased the obtained results showed that the ANN method would be a powerful tool for predicting and modeling the diurnal LST in an arid environment .,ANN and Landsat 8 spectral indexes were used to model LST in arid environment. BAEI NDBaI RH and AT were considered as inputs in ANN structure. ANN model presented 0.74K RMSE in the training process. ANN model presented 2.54K RMSE in the testing process. The weights and biases were extracted to form the mathematical equation of the ANN.
956,The study investigates the gravity waves activity detected in the mesosphere lower thermosphere region using airglow observations performed by the Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager at the Sierra Nevada Observatory 37.06,The gravity wave activity detected in the mesosphere and lower thermospherehave been studied using airglow observations taken with a Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager SATI installed at Sierra Nevada Observatory SNO 37.06 N 3.38 W from 1998 to 2015. We find activity of gravity waves with periods shorter than 3 h is maximum in summer and winter while the activity of gravity waves with period from 3 to 6 h have maximum activity around OctoberDecember and minimum during summer. The gravity wave activity detected from our data set is larger than that of the semidiurnal tide. Nonetheless it is smaller than the planetary wave activity specially in summer where the latter seems to be the largest. In general wave activity is the main source of variability of both emissions planetary wave activity being the main one responsible in the case of the O2 emission. However rotational temperatures are more affected by seasonal variations specially in OH rotational temperatures which are responsible of more than the 40 of the overall variability.
957,A new nowcasting method is herewith proposed to monitor the crucial components of the variability of the stratospheric ozone depletion . A demonstration of this method is performed considering the daily measurements of the minimum air temperature in the latitude range 50,The first Arctic O. hole during the winter spring 20192020 was attributed to the colder stratospheric temperatures. However the min temperature of the Arctic stratosphere in 20192020 was within the limits of its variability since 1979. The winter spring temperature in 20192020 was very close to that of 20102011 when no such O. hole appeared. The O. hole phenomenon is complex and does not depend only on the temperature regime of the polar stratosphere. According to the proposed nowcasting tool the Arctic O. hole will close in the last week of April 2020..
958,The lack of reliable global E region electron density or conductivity measurements has hampered a detailed and quantitative understanding of the E region electrodynamic processes . The characterization of the global E region ionospheric irregularities as a function of local time longitude and season remains a great challenge . In this study we evaluate the electron densities retrieved by Wu in the D and E regions using ground based radar data and empirical models . Unlike in the conventional top down retrieval methodology the new approach avoids the Abel weighting function that carries substantial sensitivity to the electron density residuals from the F region even after they have been corrected . The new technique uses a bottom up approach in which the F region contributions in the excess phase are more effectively removed compared to the Abel inversion and hence more accurate electron density retrievals in D and E regions are determined . The results are compared and evaluated with two low and mid latitude incoherent scatter radar observations the Arecibo Observatorys 430 MHz radar located in Puerto Rico 18,A novel GPS RO technique estimates electron densities in D and E regions more accurately compared to conventional Abel inversion. The technique is evaluated using radar observations and two empirical models IRI 2016 and FIRI 2018. Seasonal and diurnal climatology comparisons show good agreement with radar measurements and FIRI 2018 model predictions especially at 85100 km. The influence of the solar cycle on the E region can be clearly seen in the retrieved electron density.
959,Meteorological processes such as tides influence ionospheric variability through vertical coupling . For the first time we have used data from Communication Navigation Outage and Forecasting System satellite from 20082015 to develop a Neural Network vertical,A model of vertical. drift taking into account a proxy of tides has been developed based on C NOFS satellite data. In most cases the developed models reproduce the diurnal patterns of vertical. drifts including the expected pre reversal enhancement. Inclusion of tides proxy improves vertical. drift modelling by 22.2 and 16.7 over the East and West African sectors respectively.
960,For detection of rather large ionospheric structures using Global Navigation Satellite Systems we suggest employing the analysis of anomalous deviations in behavior of the absolute slant total electron content on particular GNSS receiver GNSS satellite lines of sight . Using data of four high latitude GNSS stations the proposed method allowed us to detect the 5 May 2013 high latitude ionospheric trough determine its location and size and follow the dynamics . The HLIT was located on the dayside within 25 185E . Initially the HLIT equatorial wall and bottom were within 68 78N and 70 80N respectively . The trough northern wall was not registered at this time most likely due to insufficient number of LOSs . During the next hour the trough has moved 2 4 southward . Its bottom lay near 68 76N equatorial and polar walls were within 67 74N and 77 78N respectively . The trough width was about 4 . At 07 0008 00 UT the HLIT structure and location remained almost the same . To interpret the observation results we used the model for ionosphere plasmasphere coupling to simulate the high latitude ionosphere conditions on 46 May 2013 . This simulation showed that on 5 May 2013 a high latitude trough was formed on the dayside at 40 200E and 78 85N . The most likely reason for the formation of HLIT both in model calculations and in reality was a change in the magnetospheric convection in the high latitude ionosphere caused by the moderate geomagnetic disturbances on 45 May 2013 . The trough location determined from the analysis of anomalous TEC deviations on particular LOSs was in good agreement with location of the high latitude ionospheric trough obtained from numerical simulation . Thus the analysis of anomalous deviations in TEC behavior on particular LOSs expands the GNSS potential in detecting large scale irregularities in the ionosphere .,Anomalous GNSS TEC deviations allow detect large scale ionospheric structures. High latitude ionospheric trough was registered using data of four GNSS stations. Experimental location of the trough are consistent with numerical simulation data. Anomalous GNSS TEC deviations analysis expands GNSS potential to monitor ionosphere.
961,This paper presents the results of radio observations of ionospheric disturbances associated with the fall of a meteoroid off the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula on 18 December 2018 . The ionospheric disturbances were measured with the multipath radio system designed for oblique sounding and located at the Harbin Engineering University campus the People s Republic of China . The main results are as follows . The ionospheric disturbances following the Kamchatka meteoroid entry and explosion have been detected in the temporal variations in the Doppler spectra and signal amplitudes observed over six oblique propagation paths . The possible disturbances have 23 groups of time delays . Depending on the distance between the terminal detonation point and the propagation path midpoint these time delays fall into the 2443 min 93136 min and 141183 min time intervals corresponding to the apparent speeds of 1.92.9km s 620770m s and 310500m s respectively . The disturbances with the apparent speeds of hundreds of meters per second and periods of about 1015min are transported by atmospheric gravity waves . The disturbances propagating with the 1.92.9 km s apparent speeds could be caused by ionospheric processes due to the seismic waves generated by the meteoroid explosion .,Kamchatka meteoroid of 18 December 2018 detected in Doppler spectra. Disturbance apparent speeds 1.92.9km s 620770m s and 310500m s. Speeds of hundreds of m s are transported by the atmospheric gravity waves. Speeds of 1.92.9km s could be due to seismic waves launched by the airburst.
962,A conspicuous and intermittent signature of a 120 day oscillation is found in the winds and tides in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere over a Southern hemispheric equatorial station So Joo do Cariri 7.4,Prominent 120 day oscillation is found in the equatorial MLT wind and tides. Seasonal component is relatively weaker than the instantaneous amplitude. A plausible link with the solar flux and intraseasonal oscillation is implied.
963,The paper presents climatology of the mean winds and diurnal and semidiurnal tides observed by meteor radars at high latitudinal stations Svalbard and Troms based on 18 years and 16 years of measurements respectively . The main focus of the study is to clarify the features of the diurnal tide because it is poorly known particularly at high latitudes . The detailed analysis of both tidal amplitudes and phases indicated that the seasonal and altitude structure of the DT at these two not very distant stations are significantly different . Moreover a very unusual vertical structure of the DT at Troms has been found where above altitudes of 8890km the zonal and meridional components have opposite directions of vertical propagation . This unusual vertical tidal feature has been supported by the climatology of the DT obtained by the MF radar situated at Troms for the period of time 19972019 . The paper presents also the comparison of the radar observations with two models the assimilated CMAM DAS and the specified dynamics WACCM X . The WACCM X simulated DT supports to large extent the climatology of the DT at Troms while the assimilated CMAM DAS reproduced the evanescent character of the tide in summer up to altitude of 88km with almost the same amplitudes and phases as the observed ones . These results could be used as benchmarks for model simulations for understanding the forcing mechanisms of the DT at high latitudes of the considered region .,Climatology of mean winds DT and SDT observed by meteor radars at Svalbard and Troms is presented.

964,Among the physical processes in the solar wind plasma the processes taking place in the vicinity of the front of the interplanetary shock wave and on the front itself are of particular interest . In this paper we present an analytical description of such processes which is based on the solution of a system of nonlinear equations of magnetohydrodynamics in a thin layer surrounding the front of the interplanetary shock wave and also on the use of the Rankine Hugoniot conditions in the frontal zone . Two models of a shock wave are considered one which does not takes into account the thickness of the front and another one which takes into account the finite thickness and the fine structure of the front . The influence of both models on the solar wind parameters are compared with each other . Explicit formulas describing the changes of the main solar wind parameters particle flow velocities pressure and the accompanying magnetic field in the vicinity of the front have been derived for both models . Two important facts have been established in the interaction of a SW with a shock wave . The magnetic energy of the shock front is absorbed by the SW and increases its speed . In the case of model II this process is much more intensive than with model I . The kinetic energy of the shock front in the case of model I on the contrary takes energy from the SW which leads to a decrease of the velocity of the SW particles . For model II this effect is practically absent . These results of this work are analytically proven and evaluated quantitatively .,Two models of a shock wave are considered without and with the finite thickness of the front. The transfer of magnetic energy from the FSW to the SW is more intense with model II. The transfer of kinetic energy from SW to FSW occurs only with model I. Models I and II should be considered not alternative but complementary.
965,GPS troposphere tomography is one of the most powerful techniques used to extract 3D model of the water vapor and wet refractivity using the observations from local and regional GPS networks . In this technique each unknown parameter is related to the one 3D elements called voxels . This approach is a mixed determined inverse problem because propagated signals do not pass through some of the voxels . As consequence the design matrix has rank deficiency and unique solution can not be reached . To this end additional constraints are usually applied . In this research as an innovation we utilized reflected signals from an air borne reflectometry mission over Italy as additional constraint . According to the obtained results from four distinct parts in DOYs 158 160 of 2012 reflected signals help to remove or reduce the rank deficiency of our tomographic models . Due to the lack of radiosonde and radio occultation profiles to validate the tomographic model results GPS slant wet delay observations of singular GPS stations within the desired study areas are used as a measure for validation . Depending on the number of reflected and direct signals that we used in our reconstruction area the range of bias in the developed models change from 1.6 to 6.9mm . Moreover the range of RMSE is 3040mm . The accuracy and precision of reconstructed images is adequate as far as the mean minimum and maximum values of the slant wet delays in the test areas of this study are taken into account .,The rank deficiency of tomographic model could be fixed or improved by using reflected signal as extra constraint. Adding reflectrometry data to the GPS signals supports the uniqueness of solution. First attempt using airborne reflected signals to troposphere tomography.
966,Lightning is one of the most important extreme weather conditions and is associated with heavy convective rain and thunderstorms . However the present understanding of such systems as well their effect on precipitation characteristics are insufficient for proper modelling . In this paper the rain microphysics is studied at Kolkata using an optical disdrometer in relation to the lightning activities . Lightning information is obtained from ground based World Wide Lightning Location Network and Lightning Imaging Sensor onboard International Space Station . The associated cloud features are studied with Doppler weather radar and MODIS satellite measurements . Results indicate significant change in rain microphysics between events with lightning and without lightning . The cloud microphysics indicates that the cloud top temperature is lower and cloud effective droplet size is smaller in case of lightning in comparison to non lightning situation . On the other hand large drops are abundant while small drops are less in numbers in rain with lightning than rain without lightning . The,This study focuses on the relation between precipitation microstructure and lightning. Results indicate significant change of rain microphysical properties between lightning and non lightning conditions. Cloud microstructure also seems to vary for the above two rain conditions. The results are also helpful for improvement of radar retrieval of precipitation for lightning and non lightning conditions.

968,The signature of the low latitude mesosphere response to the February 2017 minor sudden stratosphere warming was detected using the observations of a meteor radar at Fuke 19.5,The Fuke meteor radar along with ERA 5 were used to study the low latitude mesospheric signatures during the 2017 SSW. Large discrepancies are found between the mesospheric winds derived from the Fuke radar and ERA 5 during the 2017 SSW. Mesospheric wind measurements from Fuke and Tirupati radars reveal PW oscillations at low latitudes during the SSW. ERA 5 does not capture the PW activity in the mesosphere as a meteor radar.
969,The interannual variability of the total ozone in the equatorial region has been studied using the satellite daily and monthly data in 19782018 . The coupling of the equatorial TOZ changes to the quasi biennial oscillation of the zonal wind in the equatorial stratosphere has long been known . However the detailed analysis of the daily deseasonalized TOZ data over the course of 15 complete wind QBO cycles convincingly showed some new important features of the ozone QBO . The key points of the equatorial TOZ variations are clearly linked with the certain time moments during the downward propagation from 10 to 70hPa of the easterly and westerly regimes of the wind QBO . The equatorial TOZ distinctly maximizes when the westerly regime reaches 70hPa and the easterly regime appears at 10hPa which occur simultaneously . The times of minima of the equatorial TOZ are less obvious due to the westerly regime appearance at 10hPa on the background of the unfinished descent of the easterly regime . Furthermore the seasonal regularities of the wind QBO causes the seasonal dependence of the ozone QBO in the equatorial region . Maxima of the equatorial TOZ are definitely observed near solstice months . This result contradicts to the general belief about lack of the seasonal synchronization of the equatorial ozone QBO in contrast to the seasonally synchronized extratropical ozone . However the coincidence of the equatorial TOZ maxima with solstices and consequently their recurrence every 2 or 2.5 years allow a prediction of the equatorial TOZ based on the long term forecast of the wind QBO . The ozone QBO forecast for subsequent about two years is presented .,Contrary to general belief QBO in equatorial total ozone clearly depends on season. Seasonal features of equatorial ozone QBO are resulted from dependence on wind QBO. Maxima of equatorial ozone QBO are observed near solstice months June or December . Relation of maxima with solstices leads to their recurrence every 2 or 2.5 years. The seasonal dependence allows a long term forecasting of equatorial total ozone.

Superposed epoch analysis suggests that the r6absorption,We have studied cosmic noise absorption CNA during disturbed periods associated with Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections ICMES . We analysed radio ionospheric opacity meter Riometer measurements for the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies IRIS at Kilpisjrvi Finland for CNA covering solar cycle 23 i.e. 1996 2009 . We showed that the response of the ionosphere is different depending on the time that the ICME occurs. We utilised the ICME catalogue produced by one of the authors Richardson and Cane to identify ICME periods within solar cycle 23. The absorption. time profile associated with ICMEs is found to depend on whether the ICME starts in the daytime 1014 MLT or at night 22 02 MLT for IRIS Figs. 35 . We used various combinations of solar wind and IMF parameters and ranked them see Tables 2 and 3 to obtain the best coupling parameter for day and night time absorption. The daytime ICME model profile is found to correlate closely with solar wind dynamic pressure SYMH and northward B. while the night side ICME model is most closely related to B. and SYMH.
972,The magnetotail dipolarization during substorms is a mesoscale dynamical phenomenon well documented by in situ spacecraft observations numerical simulations and ground based optical measurements . The magnetic energy release during substorms results in significant plasma heating and the formation of strong temperature and density gradients behind the dipolarization front . Such gradients are the source of many plasma instabilities that are responsible for further transport of energy to smaller spatial scales . In this study we investigate an example of in situ and optical observations of the nonlinear stage of one class of such instabilities associated with the formation of sub ion scale magnetic holes in the equatorial dipolarized magnetotail .

In situ and optical observations of sub ion magnetic holes.
973,Water vapor tomography technique is a research point in global navigation satellite system meteorology . However GNSS tomography technique has an inherent issue of design matrix sparsity which leads to the ill posed problem in the inversion of normal equation . Singular value decomposition method is commonly used to resolve this problem but performs poorly due to the large fluctuation in tomographic results caused by the small singular values . To overcome the above issue this study proposes an improved ridge estimation method which only revises the relatively small singular values and retains the large singular values unchanged on the basis of the minimum deviation principle in the processing of regularization matrix . An adjustment coefficient is introduced to determine the node of small singular value with large influence on the tomographic result . Twelve GNSS stations from Hong Kong Satellite Positioning Reference Station Network were used to validate the performance of the proposed method over the period of day of year 84101 2014 . The established tomography model in SatRef was resolved using SVD and IRE methods respectively . Statistical results show that the accuracy of average root mean square error of IRE method is improved by 16.7 compared with that of SVD method when the corresponding radiosonde is considered as the reference . Additionally the comparisons of water vapor profile relative error and the reconstructed SWV derived from IRE and SVD methods were also carried out and the numerical result indicates a good performance of the proposed IRE method . Such results verify that the applicability of proposed IRE method in this paper for GNSS water vapor tomography .,This paper proposes an improved ridge estimation IRE method for GNSS troposphere tomography. Minimum deviation principle has been used to revise the relatively small singular values. The proposed IRE method is superior to the traditional singular value decomposition SVD method.

The West Africa Monsoon Index WAMI effectively captured the northward migration of the monsoon system over West Africa. We found significant and strong associations between precipitation and wind shear indices at 95 significant level. Fluctuation in precipitation was explained by 5075 variations in WAMI and Deep layer shear in the monsoon region of West Africa. Annual trends and intensity of convective precipitation are significantly influenced by variations in wind shears and WAMI over West Africa.

976,Solar flare forecasting is limited by the current understanding of mechanisms that govern magnetic reconnection the main physical phenomenon associated with these events . As a result forecasting relies mainly on climatological correlations to historical events rather than the underlying physics principles . Solar physics models place the neutral point of the reconnection event in the solar corona . Correspondingly studies of photospheric magnetic fields indicate changes during solar flaresparticularly in relation to the field helicityon the solar surface as a result of the associated magnetic reconnection . This study utilizes data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and SpaceWeather HMI Active Region Patches to analyze full vector field component data of the photospheric magnetic field during solar flares within a large HMI dataset . This analysis is then used to identify and compare trends in the different categories of flare strengths and determine indications of the physical phenomena taking place .,Larger flare trends differ from smaller flares underlying physics may differ. Helicity and twist parameters are of best use to study large flare physics. Mean vertical current density is best for forecasting small flare occurrence.
977,Sixteen variables describing the state of the magnetosphere are examined in the years 19912007 the sixteen variables include nine geomagnetic indices plus seven measures of electron and ion precipitation into the atmosphere the rate of substorm occurrence the pressure and number density of the ion plasma sheet the flux of substorm injected electrons and the radiation belt electron flux . Eight other variables are used to represent the properties of the solar wind at Earth . To estimate the time lags between magnetospheric and solar wind variables bivariate linear correlations multivariate linear correlations and vector vector correlations are utilized . Using bivariate correlation the lag time of each magnetospheric variable with respect to each solar wind variable is varied to obtain the maximum correlation coefficient . Using multivariate linear correlations the time series of each magnetospheric variable is correlated with a linear combination of the eight time series of the eight solar wind variables with eight independent lead times on the eight solar wind variables optimized to produce the largest multivariate correlation coefficient . The resulting time lag between each magnetospheric variable and each solar wind variable is then catalogued .

Optimized bivariate multivariate and vector vector correlations are used. The wind variables that strongly impact various magnetospheric variables are explored.

981,Numerical high resolution modeling of nonlinear acoustic gravity waves generated at the Earth s surface and propagating to the thermosphere shows that wave characteristics are depending on modifications in the mean density temperature molecular dissipation and composition due to variations of solar activity . Amplitudes of temperature wave perturbations are generally larger at high SA at altitudes above 150km due to larger mean temperature and smaller molecular heat conductivity . Increasing kinematic coefficients of molecular heat conduction and viscosity result in stronger decreasing AGW amplitudes at altitudes larger 150kmat low SA . Dissipating AGWs generally produce heating at altitudes below 120km . At larger heights AGWs generally heat the thermosphere at low SA and cool it at high SA . Wave enthalpy fluxes are mainly upwards below 120km altitude and downwards above 150kmat high SA where they may have directions opposite to the upward wave energy fluxes . Downward wave enthalpy fluxes correspond to AGW cooling the upper atmosphere at high SA . Nonlinear dissipating AGWs may produce upward and downward transport of atmospheric mass . These mass flows may produce adiabatic heat influxes in the upper atmosphere . Mainly positive residual wave induced mass flows at altitudes higher 150km may contribute to the wave cooling of the upper atmosphere . Wave breaking and interactions between waves and the mean flow in the nonlinear model are stronger at higher amplitudes of AGW excitation at the ground which lead to bigger energy losses for larger amplitude waves . At high SA resulting effects in the thermosphere depend on the balance between on one hand increases in wave amplitudes caused by weaker molecular dissipation and smaller transfer of the wave energy to the wave induced jet flows and on the other hand decreases in the amplitudes due to higher density and larger AGW reflection . The thermal effects of waves in the upper atmosphere may depend on competitions between heating due to dissipation of the upward wave energy flux and cooling due to divergence of the downward wave entropy flux . At high SA larger mean temperatures and larger temperature perturbations might increase magnitudes of downward wave entropy fluxes which may result in more frequent downward wave enthalpy fluxes and wave cooling of the upper atmosphere .,Characteristics of acoustic gravity waves AGWs depend on changes to the mean temperature caused by solar activity SA . Amplitudes of temperature wave perturbations are larger at high SA at heights above 150km. Dissipating AGWs generally heat the thermosphere at low SA and cool it at high SA at altitudes above 150km.
982,Energetic particle precipitation is one of the main processes by which the sun influences atmospheric composition and structure . The polar middle atmosphere is chemically disturbed by the precipitation induced production of nitric oxides NO,Sub polar O. depletion by NO. perturb zonally asymmetric O. and short wave heating and thereby planetary wave PW driving. The reduced PW forcing strengthens the polar vortices in early winter while the SH polar vortex is weakened in late winter. Vertical dipoles in temperatures are induced at high latitudes by dynamically induced anomalous mean meridional circulations. The early late winter dynamical changes migrate downward into the troposphere in NH SH .
983,Noctilucent clouds are mesospheric ice clouds occurring in the summer hemisphere at high latitudes and an altitude of about 83km . This region is the coldest of the earths atmosphere and is characterized by the presence of wave interaction and dissipation .

984,For the aim of surface refractivity analysis the overall territory of Quebec has been divided in a desired number of areas from North to South using clustering analysis . The meteorological data used in the analysis are collected from 50 stations located in various climatic regions over Quebec for the year 2013 . It is found that the best input data for the identification of areas is the water vapour pressure . The results show that the surface refractivity increase from North to South and the maximum values for all areas are observed in July or in August . However the variation of the surface refractivity remains in a relatively small interval in comparison to the variation observed in some tropical countries particularly Nigeria .,Clustering analysis has been used to identify areas with similar surface refractivity values from North to South. Surface refractivity increase from North to South. Regardless of the area the maximum values lie in summer. mountainous localities have low values of the surface refractivity since atmospheric pressure decreases with the altitude

986,High precision precipitable water vapor can be obtained using the global navigation satellite system . However the spatial resolution of the GNSS derived PWV is insufficient particularly for areas without sufficient GNSS stations . Although other techniques such as radiosonde sounding can also be used to obtain PWV generating PWV images with high precision and high spatial resolution remains difficult . Therefore this research focuses on the generation of such PWV images . A hybrid PWV fusion model is proposed which combines the polynomial fitting and spherical harmonic functions using the GNSS radiosonde derived PWV at specific stations and European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasting derived PWV at grid based points . The initial HPF model value is calculated based on the global pressure and temperature model 2 wet model . Additionally the large PWV difference and small PWV residual are estimated using the polynomial fitting and spherical harmonic functions respectively . An optimized method of determining the weightings for the different PWV sources is also applied in resolving the established HPF model . PWV derived from 254 GNSS stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China 78 radiosonde stations of the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive Version 2 data set and 961 grid points of the ECMWF ERA Interim data sets over China are used to perform the experiment . Numerical results verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed HPF model with an average root mean square of approximately 1.75mm for the entire 2014 in China and under 3mm in southeast China and in the summer in the selected four regions . This result indicates the good performance of the proposed HPF model and meets the requirement of weather nowcasting .,This paper proposes a hybrid PWV fusion model which combines the polynomial fitting and spherical harmonic functions. An optimized method of determining the weightings for the different PWV sources is applied for HPF model.

987,A model of electric discharges at mesospheric altitudes has been developed to explain the nature of optical flashes transient atmospheric events observed aboard the Russian microsatellites Universitetsky Tatyana 1 Universitetsky Tatyana 2 and Vernov . The model is based on assumption that large scale areas with a low space charge density and a low electric breakdown threshold can occur in the mesosphere thereby producing electric discharges between the charged areas . Variations in the number densities of electrons and ions in the discharge channel connecting these areas are described by kinetic equations in which spatial derivatives are disregarded . The discharge parameters such as mobility of charged particles rate of ionization and rate of electron attachment to neutral molecules are assumed to depend on altitude in the atmosphere . Numerical simulation and analytical solutions of the basic equation set make it possible to analyze the time dependences of electric field conductivity current and number densities of electrons and ions in the discharge channel at various altitudes in the atmosphere . Theoretical estimates of the TAEs parameters are best suited to the onboard observations under assumptions that first the charged areas of,Ultraviolet flashes are frequently observed onboard satellite above thunderclouds. The presence of large scale charged areas in the mesosphere is assumed. Electric breakdown between these areas can explain the observed flashes. Governing factors appear to be air ionization and electron attachment to neutrals.
988,The Nose like ion spectral structures are characterized by the deep inward penetration of ions from the near Earth plasma sheet and can extend to low L shells in the inner magnetosphere . The stationary Nose like ion structures are believed to be driven by the stationary electric and magnetic field during quiet geomagnetic times . However the global distribution picture especially for each MLT for both single and double stationary nose structures is still not reached . In this study we statistically investigate the stationary Nose like ion spectral structure based on 2 years of Van Allen probes observations . We find a clear MLT dependence of the number of stationary noses with a higher occurrence of single nose structures from 13 to 03 MLT while a higher occurrence of double nose structures from 03 to 13MLT . This is confirmed by calculating the backward drift time using backward tracing method based on the dipole magnetic field and Weimer 96 electric field model for each MLT . Simulation results indicate that the ion spectral gap which is formed due to long drift time or existence of the ion forbidden region controls the nose structure at different MLT during geomagnetic quiet times . A possible physical explanation of this MLT dependence can be a combination of the ion spectral gaps created by the region of long drift time in the dayside within the nose energy range and the persistent dawn dusk asymmetries in the convection electric field .,A statistical study of stationary nose structures distribution at each MLT. The region with higher occurrence of single nose structures is 13 to 03MLT. The region with higher occurrence of double nose structures is 03 to 13MLT. The ion spectral gaps created by long drift time may result this MLT dependence. The dawn dusk asymmetries of convection electric field may result this MLT dependence.
989,Data of temperature anomalies from different sites worldwide for the last millennium are used to extract long term components in global northern and southern hemisphere temperatures for their quantitative contribution to climate change to evaluate and to search for possible causes . The Method of Global Minimum which is capable of making a self consistent selection of trends from a data set and singling out harmonics with varying phase and amplitude is applied . Quantitative description of all components of the spectra including trends extracted for the first time by self consistent method is given and discussed . Temperature trends have highest amplitude in north south hemispheres and globally that leads to their largest contribution to climate change . Trend in north hemisphere temperature described by nonstationary sinusoid at period 1270yr shows maximum near 1300 deep minimum near 1700 and rise since 1700 to present . Trend in south hemisphere has smoothed maximum for medieval epoch minimum near 1800 and rise since 1800 . Both trends go up together since 1800 but north hemisphere temperature grows faster . Trend in global temperature described by nonstationary sinusoid at period 1000yr demonstrates deep smoothed minimum near 1750 and subsequent rise with rate of increase 0.5C 100yr since 1800 . Amplitude of the nonstationary cycle began rise since 1250 and continue to rise for present and close future . Temporal changes of amplitude and phase of nonstationary spectral components have typical features of nonlinear oscillations that points to a nonlinear mechanism supporting the periodical oscillations . It is shown that the 33 yr nonstationary component in global temperature has the highest rate of change 1.2C 100yr or 0.12C 10yr which can explain rapid temperature changes . It is also shown that periods of the temperature spectra include integers of periods of historically known eclipse cycles and of periods related with motions of Jupiter Saturn and Venus . Therefore Sun and Moon Jupiter Saturn and Venus influence on climate variability . The result also means existence of high number commensurabilities between mean motions in the system Sun EarthMoon and these planets .,The MGM method of spectral analysis capable of investigating nonlinear processes is used to analyze temperature data for the last millennium. Amplitude of global temperature trend began to rise since 1250. The trend shows warming rate 0.5C 100yr since 1800. 33 yr cycle has the highest rate of change 0.12C 10yr and can explain rapid global climate change. Shown that Sun and Moon Jupiter Saturn and Venus influence on climate variability. Shown as weak external forcing of astronomical origin can be amplified so as to influence the strong internal dynamics of a dynamo system.
990,The refined Cloud Imaging and Particle Size cloud wind tracking algorithm is elaborated and the wind product is assessed against the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System Advanced Level Physics and High Altitude winds and the horizontal wind model climatological winds . Multiple searching frame sizes are adopted to generate the preliminary wind sets which are then merged and further edited based on the clustering of the similar wind directions . The mean values of the clusters within the sampling grids of 1.51.5 or 4.54.5 are taken as the final wind product . At the coincidences the CIPS and NOGAPS winds show a moderate degree of deterministic consistency . We have further shown that on the orbit to orbit basis when the NOGAPS modeled ice and CIPS measured ice correlate better the wind agreement is also better . The difference in the two wind sets is most likely attributed to the NOGAPS temperature being deviated from the true temperature that will affect the geostrophic component of the winds and also to the fact that the CIPS winds are often ageostrophic and are cascaded into smaller scales . The CIPS zonal winds are decreased and then reversed in early June and late August whereas in the core of the season they are stronger . This overall variation pattern is shared by both NOGAPS and HWM14 zonal winds . Both NOGAPS and HWM14 zonal winds exhibit 810m s difference between cases using all local times and the CIPS LT range 1323h due to the dominant diurnal migrating tides and this may partially interpret the weaker CIPS zonal winds . The meridional winds do not follow any established intra seasonal variation pattern but rather the variability is susceptible to the sampling longitudes latitudes .,CIPS cloud wind tracking algorithm is elaborated and the wind product is assessed. Multiple searching frame sizes are adopted to create robust winds. Preliminary wind sets are then merged and edited to obtain final product. CIPS zonal and meridional winds conform to climatology. Meridional wind intraseasonal variation pattern is susceptible to the sampling path.
991,In this paper an attempt has been made to investigate the impact of different microphysical parameterization schemes in simulation of leading convective line with trailing stratiform squall lines observed over the Gangetic West Bengal region of India during the pre monsoon season of MarchMay using Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting . The model is employed to study the features associated with three TS squall line observed over the study region . The model sensitivity is evaluated with four different microphysics schemes of the model . Model simulations are carried out with three two way nested domains with horizontal resolution of 18 6 and 2km grid spacing and explicit convection in the innermost domain . The model simulated results are compared with available observations . The analysis demonstrates that the simulation of TS squall lines are very sensitive to the parameterization of microphysical processes of different MP schemes in spite of using similar initial and boundary conditions and model configuration . The model provides better simulations of rainfall maximum reflectivity and vertical profiles of hydrometeors with the Morrison MP Scheme . The study reveals that snow and graupel particles has significant impacts on the simulation of stratiform precipitation region of the TS squall line . The study suggests that simulation of TS squall lines using a high resolution mesoscale model with suitable cloud microphysics scheme is useful for the prediction of such severe events .,Rearto front flow and front to rear flow is observed in the mature stage of the squall. Vertical profile of hydrometeors mixing ratio are well comparable with observed TRMM 2A12 data. Cloud Ice and Snow particles have positive impact in development of stratiform precipitation region. Strong updraft is observed to persist in the region of copious amount of hydrometeors.
992,The wave forcing from below allows the neutral atmosphere to drive short term variability in the ionosphere . Recent modeling studies have shown that secondary waves originated from the nonlinear interaction of the atmospheric tides with planetary scale waves can contribute significantly to day to day variability of the ionosphere . In this study we used MLT neutral wind measured at So Joo do Cariri and ionospheric soundings performed by a digisonde installed at Fortaleza to investigate the presence and the induced variability by a secondary wave in the mesosphere ionosphere system over the Brazilian equatorial region . We found evidences of the nonlinear interaction between a 3.5 day ultrafast Kelvin wave and the diurnal tide . The interaction produced a 1.3 day secondary wave that was found to propagate upward with maximum amplitude of 15m s and relatively long vertical wavelength in the MLT which may allow it to penetrate into the ionosphere . In the ionosphere we observed a common 1.3 day periodic variation in the virtual height and critical frequency f,Nonlinear interaction between ultrafast Kelvin waves and diurnal tide in the MLT. Secondary wave penetration into E region dynamo. Signature of a 1.3 day secondary wave is observed in the equatorial F region. Vertical coupling in the atmosphere ionosphere system through secondary waves.
993,The response of the atmosphere to solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity is analyzed in experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model under idealized forcings . Four experiments are carried out combining high and low solar radiative forcing with high and low geomagnetic activity H7 H3 L7 and L3 . The comparison between these experiment is used to assess the effects of solar radiative forcing and geomagnetic activity mainly on the stratosphere . A two step Monte Carlo based statistical test which defines an impact score is used to assess statistically significant impacts on regional scales on pressure levels for a few key model variables like NOx ozone and temperature .,Solar irradiance have significant impact on stratospheric ozone and temperature preconditioning geomagnetic activity impact. Under solar minimum conditions geomagnetic activity has large impact on NOx but limited impact on ozone and temperature. Under solar maximum conditions geomagnetic activity can result in important effects in the stratosphere. Geomagnetic variability can thus modulate the climate impact of high solar activity without overwhelming it.
994,The results of modeling and analysis of ionospheric parameters during disturbed geomagnetic field are presented . Hourly and 15 min data of the ionospheric critical frequency at Paratunka site for the period 19682019 were applied . The modeling was based on ionospheric parameter multicomponent model developed by the authors . In order to refine model parameters three classes of anomalies were introduced . They characterize strong moderate and weak ionospheric disturbances . On the basis of the modeling we detected short period ionospheric disturbances of moderate and weak intensity preceding magnetic storms . They characterize occurrences of oscillatory processes in the ionosphere at the background of increased solar activity . Comparisons with the International Reference Ionosphere model and the median method were made . That showed the efficiency of the proposed model . For automatic performance of the approach computational solutions were suggested to detect and to estimate ionospheric disturbance parameters .,The method of ionospheric data analysis allows to study ionospheric disturbances. An abnormal increase in the ionosphere on the eve of magnetic storms was identified. The comparison of the proposed method with IRI showed its high efficiency.
995,Ionospheric disturbance detected using GPS based Total Electron Content measurements are widely used to study the morphology and dynamics of the ionosphere and its impact on radio communication and satellite based navigation . The IDs normally derived as rate of change of TEC between consecutive ionospheric pierce points at uniform time interval implicitly results in non uniform spatial sampling along the GPS satellite tracks . The non uniform spatial sampling introduces aliasing in ROT . These aliasing corrupt amplitude and Signal to Noise Ratio of the detected IDs . In this study we propose a Spatio Periodic Leveling Algorithm to remove such aliasing . Efficiency of the proposed algorithm was tested by simulating the IDs along a satellite track and validated with GPS observations carried out during 2015St . Patrick s day geomagnetic storm . Spatiotemporal and SNR analyses of simulated and observed IDs reveal that the SPLA is efficient in removing the aliases increases the SNR on an average of 99.5 compared to ROT removes the need of applying elevation cut off and expands the area of coverage up to 65 .,Non uniform spatial sampling between Ionospheric Pierce Points introduce aliasing in ionospheric disturbances detected by GPS. An improvised algorithm to obtain ionospheric disturbances free of such aliasing is proposed. The proposed algorithm was validated using GPS observations carried out during 2015St. Patrick s day geomagnetic storm. The proposed algorithm efficiently removes aliasing expands area of coverage up to 65 and increases average SNR to 99.5 .
996,Most of the heavy rainfall comes from the severe convective storms . Convective scale numerical weather prediction with grid lengths of a few km or less is capable for a more successful representation of convective scale processes and explicitly representing different types of convective storms . However despite these high non hydrostatic models in some specific atmospheric cases associated with very intense convection the present mesoscale models show some uncertainties and limitations in more accurate quantitative estimation of the intensity of heavy convective rainfall . In a way to overcome this problem we propose a novel forecasting system that employs three dimensional cloud resolving model at Large Eddy Simulations type with greatly refined resolution of 100 m over a small sub domain with the initial representative averaged vertical profiles derived from WRF NMM 1 km forecasts . LES model is configured to explicitly simulate small scale high intensity convective rainfall at that time and location where convective criteria and threshold values defined in the system interface are previously met . The cloud model then evolves independently with open lateral boundary conditions . A set of numerical experiments have been conducted and the method has been extensively tested on both tropical and mid latitude convective cases . Results show some potential benefits in simulation of convective elements cell structure and intensity . In this preliminary study we show that the proposed method gives quantitatively more accurate forecast of high intensity convective precipitation in most of the eight case studies presented when compared to the WRF NMM 1 km scale forecasts . The improved skill of the forecasts using this forecast system will probably provide useful value to forecasters so that they would be able to enhance their operational flood prediction capabilities and warnings of severe convective weather risk .,Convective Scale NWP becoming capable of explicitly representing individual convective storms. The Mesoscale Non Hydrostatic Models show uncertainties in accurate forecast of intensity and the right location of a heavy rainfall. LES runs with an open LBC as an advantage in simulating detail aspects of severe convection. A novel system based on 3 D cloud resolving LES initialized with WRF NMM 1 km forecasts has been developed to address this uncertainty and to provide useful value to forecasters and warnings of severe convective weather risk.
997,The present work reports atmospheric opacity at 220GHz over Indian Astronomical Observatory Hanle during 2006 to 2018 . The opacity data were derived from the radiometric measurement of sky brightness temperature as a function of zenith angle for every 10min during day and night . Since the operating frequency range is not completely opaque during rainfall or cloudy atmosphere observations are performed even during rainfall or cloudy sky conditions . The minimum opacities observed at the site varied from 0.06 0.07 at 1st quartile and 0.08 0.09 at 2nd quartile during December January . Opacity at Hanle is linearly correlated with high temporal resolution GPS Precipitable Water Vapor with a correlation coefficient of about 0.8 . The observed median opacity at Hanle has increased by 44 during the best observing months and 24 over the annual data with reference to the opacity observed during 20002003 . Such increasing opacity trends are apparently due to effects of the dynamics of the regional and global hydrological cycle . In order to assess the impacts of the regional and global hydrological cycle PWV obtained from AErosol RObotic NETwork satellite and reanalysis data were studied at nine high altitude astronomical observatories spread spatially across the globe such as Atacama desert in Chile Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii Hanle and Merak in India Ali and Yangbajing Observatories in Tibet LLAMA in Argentina and Dome A and Dome C in the Antarctic Plateau during 2003 2018 . On an average PWV trend over Atacama desert is increasing by 0.01 to 0.03mm per year and at IAO Hanle Merak and Ali by 0.01 to 0.05mm per year indicating non uniform dynamic hydrological cycles . Interestingly there is no noticeable PWV trend for the sites located in the Antarctic Plateau . During the four best observing months PWV observed at Hanle Merak and Ali sites have values lower than the Mauna Loa observatory by 0.14mm and 0.56mm at 1st and 2nd quartiles respectively .,Median opacities at Hanle during 20062018 varied from 0.080.09 in winter. Increasing opacity trends of 24 are noticed at Hanle using multi year data sets. Median precipitable water vapor PWV at Merak and Hanle varied from 2.162.23 mm. Increasing opacity trends are attributed to increasing PWV of 0.010.05 mm yr. Increasing PWV 0.010.03 mm yr. is observed at driest site in Atacama desert.

999,We perform a superposed epoch analysis on two groups of selected geospace disturbance events emerging from single and isolated interplanetary drivers and resulting in either the enhancement or the depletion of the average relativistic electron Phase Space Density . We investigate the occurrence of behavioural temporal patterns of solar wind and geomagnetic parameters chorus and ULF Pc5 wave activity and the source seed electron PSD in the outer Van Allen radiation belt . Our results indicate that the source electron population of 10MeV G exhibits a similar behaviour during both event groups while the 1MeV G population can be considered as negligible for the whole process of wave excitation and electron energisation . Moreover events that result in relativistic electron enhancement are characterised by statistically stronger and prolonged storm substorm and wave activity combined with an abundance of seed electrons of 100MeV G mostly at L 45 the nominal heart of the outer radiation belt .,Relativistic electron enhancements are characterised by statistically stronger and prolonged storm substorm and wave activity combined with an abundance of seed electrons. Source electrons above 10keV are well correlated with substorm activity. Source electrons below 10keV exhibit negligible differences.
1000,Solar flares are large explosions in the suns atmosphere . They can damage satellites and overload electrical systems . To manage that risk finding methods of efficiently predicting future events is very important . In this paper we introduce a full Sun flare prediction method based on the Hidden Markov modelling with two hidden states . We concentrate on the soft X ray emission data near the minimum of solar cycle and consider two different driving dynamics for both states namely the independent identically distributed random variables and the autoregressive processes the latter introducing a memory structure . We compare prediction performance for the IID and AR approaches and also with a naive prediction equal to the last observation . The solar X flux dynamics is predicted by using the day ahead forecasts . We calculate point and interval forecasts and perform relevant statistical tests to choose the best method . It appears that the AR approach is clearly superior to the IID and naive both by means of point and interval forecasts . Moreover it can well detect the higher state which can lead to very strong energy releases . Significant development of the model would be necessary to forecast solar flares over an entire solar cycle .,Solar X ray data from GOES observations are analysed by statistical methods. Hidden Markov modelling with two states is used to predict solar X ray flares. Two different driving dynamics for both states are compared for their performance.
1001,Gravity waves play an important role in the propagation of energy and momentum from the lower atmospheric regions into the upper atmosphere . Depending on the varying dissipation conditions these waves generated in the lower atmosphere can propagate higher into the atmosphere . As the neutrals and plasma share the same volume in the upper atmosphere these waves affect both these densities as they propagate . In our analysis using the information on the variations in phase offsets at different heights corresponding to isoelectron density contours at several defined transmission frequencies of digisonde vertical phase propagation speeds and vertical scale sizes of gravity waves in the daytime thermosphere have been estimated . Investigation of gravity waves by radio measurements unlike the conventional optical techniques which are limited to clear sky conditions alone enable an unhindered study of gravity wave dynamics in all weather conditions . We have found a very good semblance between the variations in derived vertical phase speeds of gravity waves in the thermosphere and Solar F,An innovative approach to derive gravity wave characteristics over long term. Daytime ionospheric variations show semi annual oscillations. Vertical speeds and scale sizes of gravity waves increase with Solar flux. Gravity wave activity in the daytime thermosphere increases with Solar flux. Linear relations obtained for gravity wave behavior as a function of Solar flux.
1002,In this paper a 20 year simulation of dust aerosol emission is conducted by using the global climate model CAM 5.1 . The simulation results revealed that North Africa the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East East Asia Australia and the other regions respectively account for 60 18 12 2.5 and 7.5 of the global dust aerosol emission . On this basis the climatology of dust aerosol emission deposition and transport in the major dust source regions of the world are characterized . The results show that the inter annual trends of dust emissions and depositions in the four major source areas are basically consistent and the seasonal variations of dust emissions dry and wet depositions are stronger than inter annual variations . The seasonal variations of emissions and total depositions are the strongest in East Asia and the weakest in North Africa . The strongest seasonal variation of wet deposition appears in North Africa and the weakest in Australia . The dry and wet deposition ratios vary significantly with season . East Asia is dominated by wet deposition while other areas are dominated by dry deposition . The dust transport in four major dust regions is mainly affected by the circulation systems at each level the free tropospheric transport of dust aerosol is controlled by the mid latitude westerlies and the dust aerosol is predominantly transported from west to east . But the transport of dust aerosols in the atmospheric boundary layer shows distinct regional characteristics with weak inter annual variation and strong seasonal variation .,A 20 year 19912010 simulation of dust aerosol is conducted by using the global climate model CAM 5.1. The simulation results revealed that North Africa the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East East Asia Australia are four major dust source regions the climatology of dust aerosol emission deposition and transport in the major dust source regions of the world are characterized.

Lightning dataset in this study is an imbalance dataset. Under bagging algorithm was applied for classification.
1004,The problem of air quality in Warsaw is related with the emission of pollutants from combustion of coal or natural gas in winter and it is a different situation than in other capitals in EU where transportation is the main source of pollution to the air . In Warsaw the impact of traffic emission on air quality is clearly visible in the warm season of the year . Therefore it is important to analyse and establish the causes of high concentrations of ozone and the associated meteorological conditions and then at a later stage purpose actions to reduce them . This work analyses the temporal variation of ozone and its precursors the main traffic pollutants in the studied area and investigates the relationship between meteorological parameters and urban air pollutants using various statistical methods . For selected smog episodes during heat waves backward trajectories have been completed to identify potential sources of pollution inflow . The traffic emission has the greatest share in the variance of the system which in the case of night time data analysis equal to 30.7 27.1 for the daytime of measurement and 23.6 for the entire period . This episodes of high ozone concentration were predominantly due to local photochemistry because all the meteorological conditions were conducive for ozone formation particularly during daytime .,Analysis of weather conditions affecting ozone episodes. Air pollution in urban area. Heat waves.
1005,The present study investigates long term variation in aerosol optical properties and their associated climatic implications over selected cities of Chitral Gwadar Karachi Lahore Peshawar and Quetta in Pakistan for the period 20052018 . For this purpose aerosol optical depth and aerosol index are retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Ozone Monitoring Instrument .

1006,The results of an investigation into whether or not eclipse shadow bands have an atmospheric origin are presented .

1007,The observations of vertical total electron content and L1 and L2 band ionospheric scintillations at an equatorial station Tarawa Kiribati under a complex severe space weather event of 49 September 2017 are presented . The VTEC increased significantly by 1.03 and 1.31 TEC units under M5.5 class flare at 20 28 UT on 04 September and M4.2 flare at 01 03 UT on 05 September respectively under the quiet geomagnetic conditions . A positive ionospheric storm with a maximum percentage change in VTEC of 16.7 followed by a negative ionospheric storm with VTEC of 32.8 occurred during the first main phase,Larger VTEC increase was produced by M4.2 class flare as compared to M5.5 due to SZA dependence of solar flare effect. A positive storm efect in VTEC followed by a negative efffect occurred associated with the first main phase of the storm. A long duration positive ionospheric storm in VTEC occurred during the second main phase of the storm.
1008,Daily harmonics of the ionospheres total electron content can be mapped using Global Navigation Satellite Systems as recently accomplished by Lean and colleagues . Here those harmonics are determined by tidal analysis of ionospheric path delay from dual frequency radar altimetry . Data from TOPEX Jason 1 and Jason 2 altimeters are used with focus on periods of medium to high solar activity . Diurnal band signals are aliased by the altimeter sampling but TOPEX Jason orbits were designed to achieve acceptable tidal aliasing . Altimeter maps reveal where corresponding GNSS based maps are in error generally near the geomagnetic equator where high wavenumber features are overly smoothed . When ocean tides are deduced from single frequency altimetry a task that relies on accurate GNSS based ionospheric path corrections any TEC errors leak directly into the tide solutions . TEC errors near and west of the Weddell Sea are likely problematic for the CryoSat 2 mission .,Diurnal oscillations in TEC plus higher harmonics and annual sidelines are mapped globally with satellite altimetry. Altimetry reveals errors in corresponding GNSS ionospheric TEC maps especially near the geomagnetic equator. Assessing GNSS TEC errors is essential when ocean tides are derived from single frequency satellite altimetry.
1009,Apparent ionospheric reflection heights estimated using electric field waveforms of negative and positive cloud to ground lightning return strokes that occurred during the same thunderstorms have been compared . We analyzed electric field waveforms of 101 CGs and 74 CGs that were recorded in August 2016 in Florida . For daytime conditions the mean ionospheric reflection height for lightning electromagnetic pulses produced by CGs is larger than that for LEMPs produced by CGs for either first or subsequent strokes although the difference is statistically significant only for subsequent strokes . For nighttime conditions the trend is the same but the sample sizes are too small to draw meaningful conclusions . For daytime conditions the mean ionospheric reflection height for subsequent strokes in CGs is smaller than that for first strokes while for CGs the mean reflection heights for first and subsequent strokes are essentially the same . This disparity is related to the fact that subsequent strokes in CGs usually develop in the channel of the first stroke while subsequent strokes in CGs usually form new terminations on ground and hence are similar to first strokes . In our dataset NLDN reported peak currents for CGs tend to be higher than for CGs for both daytime and nighttime conditions and for either first or subsequent strokes .,In daytime the mean ionospheric reflection height for CGs is larger than that for CGs. In nighttime the trend is the same as in daytime but the sample sizes are too small to draw meaningful conclusions. Peak currents of CGs tend to be higher than those of CGs which could be the reason for larger reflection heights for CGs. In daytime the mean ionospheric reflection height for subsequent strokes in CGs is smaller than that for first strokes. For CGs the mean reflection heights for first and subsequent strokes are essentially the same.
1010,Time difference of arrival technique is one of many bases to determine lightning strike location employed in a lightning locating system . In this technique at least four measurement sensors are required to correctly locate a lightning strike . Usage of fewer number of sensors will result in non unique solutions to the generated hyperbolas and hence wrong lightning strike point . This research aims to correctly determine the strike point even if only three measuring sensors are utilized . An artificial neural network based algorithm was developed for a 400km,The differences in the arrival times of lightning discharge are employed to determine the optimum distance to the flash. The TDOA method requires at least four measurement sensors to avoid false points in the calculations. Artificial Neural Network engines were trained to find the correct location of a lightning strike using three stations. TDOA based LLS equipped with trained ANN engines successfully locates the lightning strike point with a notable accuracy.
1011,The impact of initial conditions in predicting lightning activity using the Weather Research and Forecasting with the electrification extra package known as WRF ELEC model has been investigated . The severity frequency and some physical and dynamical properties of lightning occurred during 11 years are considered . Four thundercloud events with distinctive characteristics over the Tehran area were chosen for detailed study . The selection process was made based on the observational data received from the Iranian Meteorological Organization ground based lightning data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network and satellite based lightning data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor . The WRF ELEC simulations initialized with the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ERA Interim National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis and the NCEP operational Global Forecast System data have been conducted to obtain the Number Of Lightning flash density associated with each case study . The numerical simulations are compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the observations . Several statistical metrics are used in order to determine the performance of the WRF ELEC model initialized by various IBCs for lightning prediction purposes . The results show that in the most of the studied cases there is a good agreement between the simulated time averaged horizontal patterns of the Lightning Potential Index obtained from the ERA Interim based experiments and the locations of lightning occurrence of WWLLN data as well as LIS observations . Furthermore GFS based simulations have a better quantitative performance in the NOL prediction than FNL and ERA Interim based simulations regarding the values of Standard Deviation and centered Root Mean Square Error . The results of further statistical analysis using different metrics reveal that ERA Interim initialization has the best performance of lightning activity prediction .,The significance of initial conditions in predicting lightning activity using WRF ELEC model has been investigated. Good agreement between the simulated LPI of the ERA Interim based experiment and the locations of lightning from WWLLN data as well as LIS observations. GFS based exprement has a better quantitative performance in the NOL prediction than FNL and ERA Interim experiments. A statistical analysis reveal that ERA Interim initialization has the best performance of lightning prediction.
1012,The present study investigates the annual displacement of ITCZ and its role in forming and strengthening the precipitation systems in the southern part of Iran . To this end the daily precipitation data of 71 meteorological stations were received . Then the precipitation systems throughout cold seasons were extracted . Next the systems with maximum precipitation average were selected using the Deciles method . The ERA Interim data from the ECMWF were used to determine the location and displacement of the ITCZ belt for the selected rainy days . In order to assess the position of ITCZ in each selected system various indicators commonly used in global studies were evaluated . The results indicated that wind velocity and specific humidity of 700hPa were the most appropriate indicators to determine the position location of ITCZ in relation to rainfalls in the southern half of Iran . Finally the average ITCZ position was determined by drawing the location of ITCZ on the date of occurrence of each system and the overlay of the maps . The findings revealed that in all pervasive precipitation cases an ITCZ branch was separated from Sudan and Western Ethiopia and extended to the south of the Red Sea through southwest northeast . This phenomenon was noticeable in both the specific humidity and wind velocity indexes . Accordingly in all rainy days in the region the ITCZ belt was significantly orientated at the north expansion . Thus this tongue extended to the center of Saudi Arabia . To conclude strengthening low pressure Sudanese systems is related to the north oriented ITCZ expansion and tropical moisture advection into the system especially in the middle levels . Therefore heavy rains in the southern half of Iran and the Countries of the Arabian Peninsula are associated with the expansion to the north of a branch in the ITCZ . Further the ITCZ settlement occurs mainly in the south of the equator from October to March the northern boundary of which rarely reaches 5 north . However its northward movement has increased since March which is about 5 .,Investigates the annual displacement of ITCZ and its role in forming and strengthening the precipitation systems in the southern part of Iran. The survey of daily precipitation data of 71 meteorological stations and extracted precipitation systems throughout cold seasons October to May . The ERA Interim data from the ECMWF 19972017 were used to determine the location and displacement of the ITCZ belt for the selected rainy days. Revealed that in all pervasive precipitation cases an ITCZ branch was separated from Sudan and Western Ethiopia and extended to the south of the Red Sea through southwest northeast.
1013,An attempt has been made to understand the effect of the cirrus clouds on the tropical tropopause thermal structure over a tropical station Gadanki 13.45,Using radiosonde and CALIPSO observations we report the qualitative estimates of cirrus clouds effect on the tropical tropopause. Presence of tropopause cirrus clouds observed to be altering the temperature gradient in the tropopause region. For the tropopause cirrus cases CPT becomes warmer by 1.2K COT rises by 0.8km TTL thickness temperature decreases increases by 0.9km 2.2K with increase in the cloud optical thickness and cloud radiative forcing. However TTL becomes relatively colder and thicker for the cirrus clouds occurring below the tropopause.
1014,This paper presents the ground truth datasets of negative cloud to ground flashes with one single stroke in five isolated small thunderstorms . By developing a machine learning method based on the convolutional neural network we identify the return strokes during the whole life of thunderstorms with the wideband electric field waveform of lightning discharges detected by Jianghuai Area Sferic Array . The distribution of flash multiplicity in these thunderstorms exhibits an exponential decrease pattern . The single stroke flashes account for more than 30 of all NCG flashes on a thunderstorm basis and the proportion of single stroke flashes tended to be most abundant . When observed at a 20 min interval the percentage of single stroke flashes tends to change dramatically during thunderstorm developments which seems to show an opposite trend with time to the maximum flash multiplicity . Single stroke flashes tended to be associated with a weaker peak current of initial stroke compared to that of multiple stroke flashes . It is inferred that the horizontal scale of negative charge regions in thunderclouds might play an important role in enhancing the flash multiplicity .,The multiplicity characteristics of negative CGs are examined in five isolated small thunderstorms. Single stroke percentage shows a clear relationship with the maximum flash multiplicity and thunderstorm stage. Neural network method is applied to lightning waveform classification to speed up data processing.
1015,Although the horizontal density structures of the polar ionosphere have been extensively studied mostly using the F region peak density or total electron content there are relatively few studies on the vertical density structures . In this review we present the climatology of the polar ionospheric density not only in the F region but also in the E region and topside ionosphere in comparison with the mid latitude ionosphere using long term incoherent scatter radar observations at Millstone Hill Troms and Svalbard . The ISR data during the period of 19952015 are analyzed to study on the variations with local time season and solar geomagnetic activity . The diurnal variations of the F region density are much smaller in the polar region than in the mid latitude particularly in summer . At Svalbard there is a characteristic double peak structure in the diurnal variation of the polar ionosphere in winter only for high solar activity . The diurnal variation of hmF2 decreases with increasing latitude and eventually disappears at Svalbard for low solar activity but the hmF2 and its diurnal variations in the polar ionosphere are remarkably enhanced for high solar activity . The distinctive irregularity in the mid latitude F1 layer nearly disappears in the polar region especially at Svalbard . The anomalous seasonal variations of the F region density are less evident in the polar ionosphere especially for low solar activity and for high magnetic activity conditions . The polar E region density shows characteristic nighttime peaks induced by auroral precipitation but it does not necessarily increase with solar activity . The topside ionospheric density variations are much stronger in the polar region for high solar activity . Finally it is found that the polar ionospheric density profiles more strongly respond to increasing solar activity as well as the magnetic activity compared with the mid latitude ionosphere .,Diurnal variation of the polar ionosphere is largely much smaller than the mid latitude ionosphere. But hmF2 shows remarkable diurnal variations for high solar activity in the polar region. Seasonal variations of the ionosphere are less evident and only occur during low magnetic activity in the polar region. Auroral contribution to the E region density is largest in winter for low solar activity. Ionospheric responses to solar and magnetospheric energy inputs are much more complex in the polar region.
1016,Some hemispheric variation features of the near surface air and sea surface temperatures are considered . A specially designed technique of the wavelet based cross correlations is used for this purpose . In phase synchronizations of the hemispheric temperatures as whole as well as such synchronizations between land and sea temperatures are found within the timescales of one two and six seven decades . In contrast no synchronization is found within the timescales between the above indicated ones . Consideration of the afore mentioned temperatures in a long integration of the climatic model of the Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics of RAS shows lack of any synchronization . However results of the Historical experiment when effects of external forces and in particular small variations of the total solar irradiation were taken into consideration reveal similar in phase synchronizations in the same timescales in which the in phase synchronizations exist in reality but during the second half of the XXth century only . Perhaps it is so because the TSI effects were taken into consideration incorrectly for the first half of the XXth century . All synchronized temperature variations lag respective TSI variations . From this one can suppose that the namely TSI variations despite their amplitudes are very small synchronize the hemispheric temperature variations .,The interhemispheric in phase synchronization of the mean land and sea temperature variations was revealed. The existence of the interhemispheric in phase synchronization is supported by a climatic model run. Small variations of the total solar irradiation are taken into consideration in this climatic model.

Role of radiation in the formation and degradation photochemistry of some of the important trace gases is shown. This study also highlights the role of boundary layer dynamics in the trace gas concentrations variability.

1019,Information on the state of the ionosphere is of great importance for organizing communications in the short wave range . One of the main methods for estimating the ionosphere parameters is the use of modeling . Most existing ionosphere models rely on the algorithms presented in the recommendations of the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunications Union .

The CCIR coefficients are used as weights for neural network. The model with corrected CCIR coefficients provides higher forecasting accuracy.

Basic laws derived for both rotationage and activityrotation relationships allow us to trace how the activity of low mass stars changes with age during their stay on the main sequence . We focus on the evaluation of the activity properties of stars that could be analogs of the young Sun . Our study includes joint consideration of different tracers of activity rotation and magnetic fields of Sun like stars of various ages . We identify rotation periods when the saturated regime of activity changes to the unsaturated mode when the solar type activity is formed for G and K type stars they are 1.1 and 3.3days respectively . This corresponds to an age interval of about 0.20.6 Gyr when regular sunspot cycle began to be established on the early Sun . We discuss properties of the coronal and chromospheric activity in young Suns . Our evaluation of the EUV fluxes in the spectral range of,A scenario of the evolution of solarstellar activity is proposed. We specify an era of appearance of a cycle on Young Sun. Far UV radiation from Early Sun was 7 times higher than today. CMEs and flare mass loss rate by Young Sun is. yr. Total energies of solar flares today cannot exceed 3. 10. erg.
1021,This paper deals with the observations of stratospheric ozone intruding into the troposphere over the Bharati station in Antarctica made during 35th Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica during jet stream conditions . High resolution multiplatform measurements from radiosonde coupled with ozonesonde Very High Frequency radar and Micro Limb Sounder and Indian National Satellite System satellite measurements are used for the present study . The most significant observation is that there is an increase of ozone by 30ppbv in the upper troposphere and decrease by 100110ppbv in the lower stratosphere and this condition persisted for three successive days .

1022,Aerosols and cloud interaction remains highly important in the climatic process and its validation with space based Ozone Monitoring Instrument and ground based observation of Aeronet Robotic Network is therefore essential . OMI and AERONET AODs was logrithmically subset and variations observed in both instruments show spatio temporal quality of being more noticeable which could lead to changes in the microphysical scale of clouds and instrumental biases . In this study we have examined the spatio temporal OMI AODs variations over Banizoumbou and validated results using AERONET AOD precipitable water and cloud fraction data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from the period between 2014 and 2018 . Additionally estimated the absolute mean bias values of both AODs correlating the results and performing the mean and standard deviation analysis . To validate instrumental error in retrieving AOD values we calculated the root mean square error and mean absolute error with standard error of measurements and perform 7 day kinematic back trajectories at various initial pressures to estimate zonal and meridional jet winds . Additionally the seasonal loading of aerosols from the Dust Surface Mass Concentration shows aerosols masking cloud . The results show that winter season has period of good AODs agreement and the absolute bias error and its standard deviation for OMI and AERONET AODs is 0.2160.08 . The correlation results obtained with cloud and precipitable water are 0.51 0.32 and 0.20 0.18 which show high monsoon AOD dominance the desert . It could be concluded that instrumental performance has spatio temporal bias .,Knowledgeable estimation of aerosol radiative forcing remain poorly understood. We estimated aerosol optical depth precipitable water and cloud fraction data. This result clearly reveals that OMI overestimate AOD in Saharan area. It could be seen that high AOD predominance of dust emission from the desert.

1024,The knowledge of the periodic diurnal anisotropy in the cosmic ray flux intensity as well as the enhanced anisotropy that might accompany Forbush events is not novel . Theoretical models and several methodological approaches such as Fourier techniques developed to predict the diurnal vectors started appearing in the literature since 1960s . Consequently the vectors have been successfully calculated on both annual monthly and day to day basis . The amplitude and the phase of the unusually large diurnal wave trains that happen at the time of FDs have also been estimated by the method of Fourier analysis . However direct application of Fourier transform algorithms to account for the enhanced CR diurnal anisotropies during the period of Forbush events is one of the open questions in CR research . Manual FD event identification technique traditionally employed to select the short term rapid depressions in CR intensity is inefficient to handle the characteristic CR flux superposition tendencies . Identifications of FDs and the accompanying enhanced amplitude of the CR diurnal anisotropies are rarely investigated simultaneously . This poses a drawback on quantitative prediction of the impact of CR anisotropies on the detectable number of global and location dependent FDs as well as their magnitudes . A detailed and rigorous analysis involving simultaneous application of Fourier analysis to FDs and diurnal anisotropies selections of FDs from Fourier transformed and raw CR data are attempted in the current work . The results are discussed with emphasis on simultaneity of FDs detected at different locations at Earth .,Fourier analysis may be employed to calculate Forbush event and CR diurnal amplitudes. Diurnal anisotropy should be filtered prior to selection of Forbush decreases FD . Simultaneous FD should be selected from preliminary processed CR data.
1025,Ionospheric scintillation is quite a common phenomenon over the low latitude regions and in East Africa it is often monitored using measurements from the SCIntillation Network Decision Aid receivers . The SCINDA receivers over East Africa are characterized by long base lines and data paucity thus offering a huge challenge in the long term scintillation characterization over the region . To alleviate this challenge we implemented the use of data from the dual frequency GPS receivers of the IGS network in combination with data from the SCINDA receiver at Nairobi Kenya to model amplitude scintillation .

1027,This study is concerned with the effects of a decrease in the air pollution concentration on the lightning characteristics of two large Brazilian cities . The decrease in air pollution happened from March 20 till April 02 2020 and it was caused by the social distancing effort to contain the COVID 19 spread in the cities . In So Paulo the ratio between cloud to ground to intracloud flashes and the average peak current of negative cloud to ground flashes significantly decreased whereas in Belo Horizonte the ratio between positive and negative cloud to ground flashes significantly increased with respect to the values in previous years .,Social distancing due to COVID 19 reduces the pollution in large cities of Brazil. Ratio of cloud to ground to intracloud lightning varies with changes in pollution. Lightning polarity and intensity vary with changes in pollution.
1028,Long term forecasting of solar activity over a scale of centuries is of interest in modeling climate . Reconstructions of solar irradiance based on radionuclides span 9.4 to 11.5 millennia . There is evidence of multiple maxima and minima as well as changes in trend . Analysis of the data yields ambiguous results . Fourier spectra find long cycles in the data but these are not confirmed in the time domain . The autocorrelation function decays slowly over a period of several decades indicating that the data is probably not predictable beyond these horizons . Wavelet analysis indicates that the energy is spread out over a range of frequencies making it impossible to identify cycles at fixed periodicities . This paper tests time series and artificial intelligence models . Forecasting experiments are run over horizons ranging from 44 to 250 years . At 44 years the models do reasonably well but beyond about 88 years the models do not forecast effectively . The deterioration in accuracy is observed in all the methods tested . Despite the finding of low frequency peaks in the spectrum models incorporating long cycles do particularly badly . The failure of the models to predict at longer horizons supports the interpretation that the sun has chaotic or stochastic properties . The forecasts are consistent with simulation studies in which maxima and minima occur at irregular intervals making their timing unpredictable .,Solar data spanning 11.5 millennia are analyzed. Forecasting tests are run using time series models and neural networks. Solar activity is predictable over spans of a few decades. After about 88 years forecast accuracy falls away.
1029,In this study the solar cycle modulation of the connection between boreal winter El Nio South Oscillation and following summer South Asia High are revealed . For El Nio accompanied by low solar cycle or La Nia accompanied by low solar cycle the boreal winter ENSO prominently affects the following summer s SAH variation . The SAH is enhanced and expanded in the meridional and zonal directions in the EL LS phase . The composite difference in the SAH between El Nio and La Nia events is obviously stronger in the low solar cycle phase . In low solar cycle phase El Nio signal and charging process are stronger which lead to stronger warming sea surface temperature appear in tropical Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent extending to northwestern Pacific resulting in larger SAH variations via warming tropospheric temperature . However for El Nio with a high solar cycle or La Nia with a high solar cycle the variations in the SAH and the composite difference of the SAH between El Nio and La Nia events are quite weak in the high solar cycle phase . The charging process over tropical Indian Ocean induced by El Nio is weaker in the high solar cycle phase which leads to weaker warming SST appear over tropical Indian Ocean resulting in smaller SAH variations .,The ENSO SAH connection is modulated by the 11 year solar cycle. Stronger charging process and TIO SST anomalies in low solar cycle phase resulting in larger SAH variations. Weaker charging process and TIO SST annomalies in high solar cycle phase leading to smaller SAH variations.
1030,The Annular Solar Eclipse occurred on December 26 2019 which was visible at most of the South Indian subcontinents with greater than 80 obscurity particularly during the morning hours and it played a crucial role in the atmospheric dynamics . For the first time the ground based measurements have used to investigate the fluctuations of air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed and direction UV A radiation and turbulence parameters on solar eclipse day over a semi arid region Anantapur in Southern India . The Surface Layer meteorological parameters have abruptly changed on eclipse day as compared to the control day . During eclipse day the near surface air temperature was significantly decreased and relative humidity increased after 60min of the beginning of the eclipse which mainly due to cooling the surface . The atmospheric pressure has reduced by 0.9hPa during the eclipse period and the winds speed also reduced to 0.92ms,The significant reduction of temperature has noticed during the eclipse. The UVA radiation showed 16.85 Wm 2 decreased at the maximum phase of the eclipse. The TKE has reduced to 0.37 m2s 2 due to the turbulence weakening on the eclipse day. The stability parameter reached zero at the peak phase of ASE during the eclipse day.

1032,The importance of gravity waves in the redistribution of energy and momentum in the Earth s atmosphere is well known . It is extremely important to understand the nature of variation in the GW characteristics to address issues of coupling in the Earth s atmosphere . We have used digisonde measurements to investigate the variation in thermospheric wave dynamics in the daytime over low latitudes during geomagnetic quiet and disturbed times . Vertical phase speeds and wavelengths of GWs are calculated by monitoring the phase offsets in the digisonde derived height variations of constant electron densities throughout the day . During geomagnetic quiet times the magnitudes of vertical propagation speeds of GWs and their vertical wavelengths show seasonal variation and vary in the range of 1070ms,Daytime vertical propagation of gravity waves is temperature dependent. Vertical speeds and scale sizes of gravity waves show seasonal variation. Season dependent direction in propagation of GWs are presented. Vertical propagation speeds and wavelengths show two peaks annually. Vertical propagation in GW is correlated with AE index during geomagnetic storms.
1033,Thermodynamic indices have been used as a tool for nowcasting thunderstorms for decades . The present study deals with understanding the variations in threshold values of various thermodynamic indices during pre monsoon season at two north eastern Indian stations Agartala and Guwahati . The study utilises thirty years of radiosonde data surface information about thunderstorms and TRMM daily rainfall data . The threshold values for five years period interval each has been determined for fourteen thermodynamic indices to the whole period . The indices related to latent potential and convective instability responded differently at both the sites .,The study analyses thermodynamic indices related to thunderstorms for 19872016 over Guwahati and Agartala. Threshold values for five years each have been found for the study. 12 UTC threshold values are showing clear trends at both the sites. CAPE and CIN threshold values are increasing over the sites.
1034,The secular variation spatial pattern of geomagnetic cutoff rigidity Rc is analyzed considering analytical expressions . Strmer analytic Rc equation in terms of geomagnetic latitude is used considering a pure dipolar field for the centered and eccentric dipole coordinates together with a dipole quadrupole superposition simplified equation . Linear Rc time trend for the period 19002020 in a 515 latitude longitude grid is assessed in each case and a comparative analysis is made with trends based on trajectory based Rc estimations . Common features with some analytic approaches are the two patches of Rc positive and negative trends in the western hemisphere even though maximum and minimum trend values are underestimated in all analytical cases . Global mean values are almost coincident except for the dipole quadrupole superposition case . The salient patches pattern may be due mainly to the dipole axis rotation more than to its center displacement its decreasing momentum or the increasing quadrupolar component role . Even though with the advent of better computational tools the trajectory based estimation would be a natural choice to analyze Rc variations we still consider that an appropriatelymodified Strmer equation with its natural advantages of its analytical form and extremely fast way of computation is sufficient for many applications .,Planetary distribution of cutoff rigidity secular trends is assessed analytically. There are common main features with trajectory based estimations. The salient patches pattern may be due mainly to the dipole axis rotation.
1035,In this paper the wavelet packet transform is applied to analyze the time frequency features of three kinds of lightning events and a new identification method based on WPT is proposed . The magnetic field data used in this paper were recorded by Nanjing Lightning Location Network in 2018 . Firstly the wavelet spectra of three typical lightning events are given and it is found that spectral ranges of these three events are different . The predominant radiation frequency of the stepped leader is the highest and that of the return strokes is the lowest . A total of 232 cloud pulses 876 return strokes and 373 stepped leaders are analyzed by WPT in order to investigate their behavior in time frequency domain . The statistical result shows that the cloud pulse return stroke and stepped leader radiate predominantly in the frequency range 956kHz 214kHz and 52236kHz respectively . According to the energy distribution characteristics three indices are proposed to distinguish the different lightning events . It is found that the recognition rate of return stroke is 91 and that of stepped leader is up to 93 .,The magnetic field data recorded by Nanjing Lightning Location Network were analyzed by the wavelet packet transform. The predominant frequency range of different lightning events could be obtained. Finding that the energy variation in frequency domain is different for different lightning events. Based on theWPT three new identification indices were proposed to distinguish three kinds of lightning events.
1036,The pre monsoon aerosol concentration plays a significant role in modifying precipitation amount over the Indian sub continent . A large variety of aerosol from different sources produces a complex radiative and climate response through the interaction with the hydrometeorological parameters . In this study we analyzed the space time dynamics of aerosol optical depth in relation to the meteorological and surface parameters over Indian sub continent during pre monsoon season from 2007 to 2016 . The level 3 daily aerosol products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi angle Imaging Spectroradiometer were used . The IMD gridded rainfall and temperature ECMWF derived RH and wind velocity and GLADS derived soil moisture data were also used at daily time scale . For the space time model the Mann Kendall trend test and a pixel based multiple linear regression were used while wavelet transformation was used on these daily observations for analyzing periodicities of AOD . The time series average shows moderate to high AOD including a consistent positive anomaly in the Indo Gangetic basin in north India . A significant inter annual variation is also observed both in MODIS and MISR datasets . The trend statistics shows an increasing trend of aerosol concentration in the eastern and southern India . The linear regression shows a variable response of AOD with changing magnitude of meteorological factors . However a substantial spatial coverage of significantly decreased AOD is observed with increasing soil moisture content . The wavelet analysis manifests the abundances of 32128 days of cycle with a periodic interjection of 832 days of cycle suggesting occurrence of fine and coarse mode aerosols events respectively . The coherency of time series AOD and other covariates shows varying leading and lagging dynamics in these two principal periodicities . The findings however evidenced a notable difference in the space time patterns of AOD in MODIS and MISR datasets . The analyzed AOD cycles are coincided with the Madden Julian Oscillation that recurs every 3060 days interval . The findings also support the theoretical proposition of elevated heat pump theory driven by fine mode aerosols for occurring pre monsoon and monsoon precipitation over the Indian sub continent . The analyzed periodicity of AOD can provide useful insights in studying the short long term variability of precipitation over polluted environments during the pre monsoon season .,Mann Kendell test reveals increasing trend of AOD in the eastern provinces. Significant negative relationship of AOD is obtained with soil moisture. Presence of 32128 days cycle in the time series is evident of fine mode aerosols. Differences are observed for wavelet and regression results between MODIS and MISR. The longer periodicity of AOD support the theoretical proposition of EHP over India
1037,A local maximum value of ionospheric total electron content in midlatitude regions named midlatitude ionospheric peak in this study has been frequently observed during both the daytime and nighttime . We have carried out a modeling study of midlatitude ionospheric peaks in TEC using the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model to investigate possible mechanisms driving these peaks . Comparisons between model results and Global Position System TEC observations in the solar minimum year of 2009 show that TIEGCM can reproduce the nighttime and daytime midlatitude ionospheric peaks . Model results indicate that midlatitude ionospheric peaks in the daytime and nighttime are likely caused by different mechanisms . Nighttime midlatitude ionospheric peaks are attributed to the downwards moving plasma ambipolar diffusive flux from the plasmasphere . However the daytime upwards moving plasma ambipolar diffusive flux and poleward meridional winds which can cause ionospheric depletion might play dominated roles in producing midlatitude ionospheric peaks in the early morning in the winter season .,Nighttime midlatitude peaks are caused by downward plasma diffusive flux from the plasmasphere. The seasonal characteristics of nighttime midlatitude peaks depend on local times. Daytime midlatitude peaks in the early morning are related to plasma diffusive flux and winds.
1038,Preliminary results from the measurement of potential gradient for the period of March 2018February 2019at the University of Kashmir Srinagar India is reported . The annual mean diurnal variation of PG represents typical double maxima pattern with the primary maximum at 09001000 LT and the secondary maximum at 19002000 LT which is in accordance with the measurements at different continental stations . The primary maximum of PG and its extended duration is explained by the sunrise effect due to increasing surface temperature the development of surface convection and hence the boundary layer probably favour the uplifting of the surface aerosols . The higher PG values measured at Kashmir valley were explained with the height of the measurement from the surface and the role of mountain valley winds circulation . Monthly mean PG showed the higher value during December and minimum in June and the amplitude variations were attributed to the local PM concentrations . PG is found to be highly influenced by PM,First measurement of potential gradient PG over Srinagar at the University of Kashmir. Diurnal variation of fair weather PG remains higher than the all weather. Seasonal PG values are higher in winter and autumn as compared to summer and spring. Aerosol and PM concentration plays an important role in atmospheric electricity.
1039,This work studies the temporal variation of rain heights in the Sub Sahelian and Coastal regions of Nigeria using six years Tropical Rain Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar reprocessed data retrieved from the Global Precipitation Measurement constellation Satellites and Era Interim Field of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast . The research reveals seasonal temporal as well as spatial dependence of rain height over the regions . The average annual Zero Degree Isotherm Heights and rain height in the Sub Sahelian regions are 4.796km and 5.11km respectively while the corresponding values in the Coastal regions are 4.845km and 4.91km . The results show that the values recommended by the International Telecommunication Union Radio section underestimate both ZDIH and rain height . Atmospheric parameters at rain height levels were also compared with rain height . Among all the atmospheric parameters considered the result shows that variation of rain height in both regions depends strongly on temperature with a determination coefficient r,The spatio temporal variation of rain height is an important factor in the estimation of rain induced attenuation. Study reveals that International Telecommunication Union ITU R recommendation under estimates rain heights. The research reveals that rain height varies more proportionately with temperature than other atmospheric parameters. The results prescribed rain heights for the study areas and modeled equations for the prediction of rain heights.
1040,The effect of precipitating high energy particles on atmospheric physics and chemistry is extensively studied over the last decade . In majority of the existing models the precipitating particles induced ionization plays an essential role . For such effects it is necessary to possess enhanced increase in ion production specifically during the winter period . In this study we focus on highly penetrating particles cosmic rays . The galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the Earths stratosphere and troposphere . On the other hand the atmospheric ionization may be significantly enhanced during strong solar energetic particle events mainly over the polar caps . A specific interest is paid to the most energetic solar proton events leading to counting rate enhancement of ground based detectors namely the so called ground level enhancements . During solar cycle 23 several strong ground level enhancements were observed . A sequence of three GLEs was observed in OctoberNovember 2003 the Halloween events . Here on the basis of 3 D Monte Carlo model we computed the energetic particles induced atmospheric ionization explicitly considering the contribution of cosmic rays with galactic and solar origin . The ion production rates were computed as a function of the altitude above sea level using reconstructed solar energetic particles spectra . The 24h and event averaged ionization effects relative to the average due to galactic cosmic rays were also computed .,Using 3 D Monte Carlo model we computed the atmospheric ionization effect during Halloween GLE events. We computed the ion production rates and ionization effect as a function of the altitude. We quantified and compared the 24h and event averaged ionization effects.
1041,Ionospheric irregularities are small scale disturbances in the ionosphere which disrupt radio waves by causing amplitude and phase scintillations . Global Navigation Satellite System network can work as two dimensional array to provide the spatial structure of the irregularities . With derived vertical total electron content we propose a spatial fluctuation of TEC parameter to identify and analyze ionospheric irregularities . It is defined as the spatial dispersion of VTEC within a specific area at a given time . With the observations from the GNSS Earth Observation Network of Japan the size of the specific area for SFT calculation can be chosen as 0.80.8 in longitude and latitude which corresponds to approximately 77km95kmat 35N at 400km height . An SFT map is generated by sliding window at a step size of 0.1 which shows the spatial structure of the ionospheric irregularities and hence gives the size shape orientation and intensity distribution of the irregularity structures . Evolution of ionospheric irregularities can be studied with SFT maps . Case studies are carried out for three strong irregularity events on February 12 2000 March 20 2001 and November 10 2004 . The irregularities are found to present as anisotropic branching structures which elongate in north south direction when first seen at lower latitudes . The structures can move and deviate from their previous orientations and eventually drift perpendicular to their orientations . Such analyses with SFT should be interesting for morphology study and model construction of ionospheric irregularities .,Ionospheric total electron content TEC is obtained with high spatial resolution. The spatial fluctuation ofTEC SFT is defined to characterize the structure of ionospheric irregularities. Evolution of ionospheric irregularities is studied with SFT maps.
1042,ENSO has significant impact on the precipitation pattern in summer over China . To differentiate the different impacts from El Nio and La Nina two groups of experiments were conducted using WRF Chem CO tracer model with one group for summer 2015 and the other group for summer 2010 . The study explained the difference between 2015 and 2010 as strong El Nio and La Nina respectively with a perspective of the contributions from different vapor sources . The results show that in El Nio years positive anomalies are distributed over southern China while negative anomalies are distributed over the Indian Ocean western China and the Tibetan Plateau . In 2015 the correlation between water vapor and precipitation was higher than in 2010 which indicated a more consistent trend of the water vapor under El Nio than La Nina . The difference between 2015 and 2010 on contributions from different vapor sources were mainly resulted from the Arabian Sea the Bay of Bengal the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean . The Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean contributed very little over China . The oceanic vapor over China has larger impact in 2015 than in 2010 in June but smaller in July and August . South China and the Tibetan Plateau are two regions greatly influenced by ENSO . In 2015 their average water vapor experienced increases around late June mid July and mid August . Furthermore the increase over SC showed a clear signal transporting from east to west . In 2010 their increases were less significant especially for TP . A stronger water vapor transport under El Nio than La Nina is implied . However the vapor from the Indian Ocean was reduced in 2015 which means the enhancement in water vapor transport towards these two regions were mainly contributed by the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea .,Opposite patterns of precipitation anomaly showed under El Nio and La Nina. El Nio indicated a higher conversion rate from vapor into rainfall than La Nina. ENSO related vapor contribution differed mainly on the Indian Ocean SCS and the Pacific Ocean. A wave signal of vapor from east to west over South China is showed in 2015.
1043,Financial risks related to crude oil imports are certainly affected by crude oil price uncertainty . Our question is How important is it to take also physical risks such as the crude oil exporters political risks and transportation risks into account when controlling financial risks in line with the importers risk attitude when planning crude oil imports and transportation at a tactical level In this paper two stage stochastic programming models are proposed to illustrate the problem and a numerical test is conducted to better understand the effects of physical risks . The mechanism for controlling risk will be forward physical contracts . The results show that the real financial risk is much higher than the importer might believe if physical risks are not considered . Unless the importer is risk neutral more forward crude oil will be imported when physical risks are considered and the distribution of forward crude oil will depend strongly on correlations among risks .,Physical risks are considered for handling financial risks in crude oil imports. Two stage stochastic programming models are proposed to illustrate the problem. More forward crude oil will be imported when physical risks are considered. Without considering physical risks the real risk is higher than the importer thinks. The mechanism for controlling risk is forward physical contracts.
1044,The pre marshalling problem has been extensively studied in recent years with the aim of minimizing the number of movements needed to rearrange a bay of containers . Time is a more realistic objective for measuring process efficiency and we show that it does not correlate with the number of movements . As a result we study the problem of minimizing crane times and develop two exact approaches to solve it an integer linear model and a branch and bound algorithm with new upper and lower bounds dominance criteria and a heuristic procedure to provide optimal solutions for problems of practical size .,A crane time minimization objective to solve the pre marshalling problem is proposed. We present novel upper and lower bounds and dominance criteria to solve the problem. Two exact approaches are proposed an IP model and a branch and bound algorithm. We conduct an extensive computational study to show the performance of our proposals.
1045,The paper proposes a two stage approach that combines data mining and complex network theory to optimize the locations and service areas of dry ports in a large scale inland transportation system . In the first stage candidate locations of dry ports are weighted based on their eigenvector centrality in the complex network of association rules mined from a large amount of international transaction data . In the second phrase dry port locations and their service areas are optimized using the gravity based community structure . The method is validated in a real case study which optimizes a large scale dry port network in Mainland China in the context of the Belt and Road Initiatives . As a result optimal dry port locations include key transportation hubs that closely reflect the real BRI development plan hence the proposed approach is validated .,Use data mining and complex network for large scale dry port location optimization. Optimal locations are derived from microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives. Chinese dry ports have strong community structure in the Belt and Road Initiatives.
1046,This paper investigates the efficiency of buyer lending in a supply chain with a retailer and a capital constrained supplier subject to spectral risk measures . We show that the retailer should always charge the supplier the lowest possible interest rate under the buyer lending scheme . The retailer is better off in the buyer lending scheme than in the bank lending scheme if he is risk neutral or risk seeking regardless of the suppliers risk attitude internal capital and bankruptcy costs . However the retailers preference switches to bank lending as his risk aversion increases to a certain level . A comprehensive comparative statics analysis is provided .,We conduct a comparative study on the performances of buyer lending and bank lending in a bilateral supply chain. The risk attitudes of the supplier and retailer are reflected by spectral risk measures. The retailer should charge the supplier the lowest possible interest rate for the buyer loan. The retailer is better off in buyer lending than in bank lending if he is risk neutral or risk seeking. The supplier prefers buyer lending if her internal capital is high and prefers bank lending if her internal capital is low.
1047,This study investigates a platforms preferences between agency selling and reselling considering the impact of data driven marketing . Four models are built No DDM agency selling No DDM reselling DDM agency selling DDM reselling . Sales volumes profits and profit growth rates in different sales modes are compared . Results show that with an increase in DDM efficiency the platform is more willing to adopt the reselling mode . In addition without DDM the sales mode with higher sales volume is not more profitable within a certain market size . DDM can help avoid this phenomenon to a certain extent .,Agency selling mode and reselling mode of the platform are investigated. The impacts of data driven marketing DDM on the sales mode selection are studied. The platform prefers agency selling mode only when the market size is moderate. With an increase in DDM efficiency the platform more prefers the reselling mode. The sales mode with higher sales volume is not more profitable in some conditions.

The results reveal that freight volume logistics employment and total social retail are important factors determining whether a city should establish Smart Logistics or not . Additionally the decision whether to establish Smart Logistics is an exogenous policy variable to carbon emissions . The implementation of SLP can restrain carbon emissions significantly with a continuous impact in the second year . Based on the findings of this paper a series of policy implications with respect to promote the development of Smart Logistics were proposed .,A difference in differences DID model was constructed in this study. The effect of Smart Logistics policy on Chinas carbon emissions was investigated. Freight volume employment and total social retail are key influencing factors. The Smart Logistics policy can restrain carbon emissions significantly. The policy has a continuous impact on carbon emissions in the second year.
1049,This study is motivated by international retailers cooperating with their suppliers to reduce carbon emissions across supply chains . Information sharing is a strategy often used in collaborative mechanisms and we investigate information sharing and study its effect on carbon emission reduction . We construct a formal Bayesian forecast updating model and find out that information sharing benefits the supplier but hurts the retailer . Demand information sharing has no impact on global emission reduction but significantly reduces the wasted emission i.e . emission from producing unwanted products . Upgrading manufacturing technology provides an incentive for the retailer to share information with a highly cost efficient supplier to achieve the reduction of global emission and wasted emission . Meanwhile consumers green awareness strengthens this effect . We extend the model to investigate the impact of additional ordering cost in QR mode and risk averse decision making behaviors assessing information sharings effects in these cases . We demonstrate that information sharing can amplify treatments positive effects and diminish the measures negative influences when applied in the supply chain . The information sharing mechanism does not always benefit the environment and supply chain contrary to the popular belief that collaborative contracts between retailers and suppliers are always advantageous .,Integrating the information sharing mechanism into the green supply chain. Considering emission reduction rather than traditional side payment as the incentive for information sharing. A case study for the fast fashion industry using real world data. First study to combine green awareness and risk averse decision maker with information sharing. Information sharings enhancement effect and the conditions that favour information sharing are discovered.

1051,Consider a supply chain with a supplier selling to downstream competing manufacturers who purchase demand information from a third party information provider . We show that the equilibrium number of manufacturers who purchase the information service depends only on the downstream competition intensity . We further investigate two contract schemes wholesale price and index based price . We find that the latter benefits the supplier but causes the information accuracy and service price to depreciate thereby reducing the information providers profit . Finally we provide guidance to the supplier on when it should rely on a third party information provider instead of offering information service in house .,We study the effect of third party information in a two echelon supply chain with downstream competition. The equilibrium number of informed manufacturers depends only on competition intensity. Index based contract benefits the supplier but depreciates information accuracy and price. We identify conditions when the supplier should rely on third party information.

1070,In this paper we present a complex network analysis of the air transport network using the air cargo instead of the passenger perspective . To the best of our knowledge this is the first work where a global cargo network comprising passenger airlines full cargo airlines and integrators capacity was studied . We used estimated yearly cargo capacity between airport pairs as input to the model . After assessing network characteristics of the sub networks representing different carrier types the full network was obtained as a super imposition of the individual sub networks . The resulting network has both small world and scale free characteristics . Its topological properties resulted in a higher flow imbalance and concentration with respect to its passenger counterpart with a smaller characteristic path length and diameter . This result is consistent with the larger catchment area of cargo airports which heavily rely on road feeder services for the ground leg . Finally we showed how different attack strategies result in hubs of hub and spoke systems or airports behaving as bridges between communities being attacked first . We believe this work to be of relevance both for academics and for practitioners in an era where due to the soaring of e commerce and next day delivery new players are entering the air cargo business and competition is constantly increasing .,Complex network theory analysis of the air cargo transport network. Air cargo transport network displays small world and scale free characteristics. Smaller characteristic path length when compared to passenger networks.

1071,Emerging markets have witnessed the logistics volume surge along with economic growth which also brings environmental issues such as packaging waste . Therefore many responsible logistics service providers are observed to put efforts in developing sustainable logistics . Such efforts improve the LSPs brand image to expand the market potential and benefit the original equipment manufacturers who use the LSPs logistics service . In this paper we consider an OEM and a LSPs preferred outsourcing structures by incorporating the LSPs sustainable efforts and the competition with the OEM when it has the self branded business . The introduction of sustainable efforts alter the LSPs cost structure and eventually the supply chain parties preferences over the OEMs procurement outsourcing . For the OEM the bundled outsourcing does not necessarily yield a lower procurement cost than only outsourcing the logistics because the LSP possesses sufficient service pricing flexibility . Interestingly the LSP prefers the OEMs bundled outsourcing when the OEMs brand image advantage is either not significant or very significant . The driving force is the tradeoff between the profits from product sales and outsourcing services . Lastly we compare the environmental performances under alternative outsourcing structures showing the simultaneous improvement of the OEMs profits the LSPs profits and the environmental performance is achievable when the OEM outsources the bundled functions of procurement and logistics .,OEM with significant brand image advantage has cost saving under Turnkey. LSP puts more sustainable efforts given OEMs insignificant brand image advantage. The dual profit source structure inflects LSPs outsourcing preferences twice. Turnkey could simultaneously improve profitability and environmental performance.

1074,The problem addressed in this paper seeks for an optimal routing of freight orders through an intermodal transportation network . We consider the case of environmentally aware customers that request to ship orders with no more than a specified amount of greenhouse gases which establishes so called emission limits . In order to ensure that a routing plan complies with each orders emission limit it is necessary to estimate emissions caused by the used transport services and to allocate these emissions to the orders . We model this problem under cost emission and service objectives and apply it to an intermodal rail road network in Europe .,Orders with given emission limits are routed through an intermodal network. Emission limits impact the selection of allocation schemes and the orders routing. Emissions allocated to an order can increase if other orders have tight limits. Emission minimizing solutions often use a mix of allocation schemes in the network.

But the perishable nature of blood products limits the possibility of storing a large amount of it and the quality of blood products reduces rapidly with transportation time . Specifically in China the management of blood products is even more complicated due to the significant demand for clinical blood which increases every single year because of the reformation of the health system and the resulting scale expansion of hospitals . In this research we aim to optimize the blood product scheduling scheme by constructing a vendor managed inventory routing problem for blood products which balances the supply and demand such that the relevant operational cost is minimized . Then a decomposition based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed mathematical model efficiently . Based on a series of numerical experiments of platelets we obtain and examine the distribution plan and optimal transportation path over the planning horizon . In addition to the illustrated high algorithm efficiency the computation results show that the VMIRP scheme can considerably decrease the operational cost of the blood supply chain .,The blood distribution scheme is optimized through a vendor managed inventory routing problem. Both shortage and wastage of blood products are considered in minimizing the total cost. A decomposition based algorithm is integrated with an adaptive large neighborhood search method.

1081,We consider an e commerce retailer who must ship orders from a warehouse to a set of customers with delivery deadlines . As is often the case the retailer uses a third party service provider to ensure its distribution . The retailer can enter the supply chain of the service provider at various levels . Entering it at a higher level entails lower sorting costs for the retailer but higher delivery costs and longer delivery times . The customer orders arrive at various moments over a rolling planning horizon . This means that the retailer must also make consolidation decisions .

Thus this research offers a novel non toxic and eco friendly dolomite depressant 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid for selective flotation of fluorapatite with sodium oleate as a collector . The selectively depressing effect and adsorption mechanism of PBTCA in the selective flotation of fluorapatite from dolomite were investigated via a series of experiments and analyses . The results from zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the chemisorption of PBTCA onto dolomite was much stronger than fluorapatite . Crystal chemistry calculation and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirmed that large amounts of Mg sites only exposed on the dolomite surface mainly accounted for the selective adsorption of PBTCA onto dolomite due to the strong affinity to PBTCA . Moreover the chemisorption of NaOL onto fluorapatite was hardly affected by the pre addition of PBTCA whereas the intensive chemisorption of PBTCA prevented the adsorption of NaOL onto dolomite . As a result in the presence of PBTCA dolomite exhibited a poor flotation performance while there was good floatability for fluorapatite which benefited the efficient recovery of fluorapatite from dolomite by froth flotation .,PBTCA strongly depresses the flotation of dolomite rather than that of fluorapatite. PBTCA is selectively adsorbed onto dolomite in the form of HL. and L. at pH 9.5. Many Mg sites enhance the adsorption of PBTCA onto dolomite. NaOL is still selectively adsorbed onto fluorapatite in the existence of PBTCA. PBTCA can improve the selective flotation of fluorapatite from dolomite.

Losses of biodiversity alter ecosystems processes eroding their capacity to deliver ecosystem services . Dung beetles are critical ecosystem service providers making them an ideal ecological indicator to explore the effects of land use change on biodiversity . Dung beetles were sampled across three land use types in the summers of 2015 and 2016 in the Eastern Cape province South Africa . Game ranching is regarded as a relatively low intensity land use type . It was compared with cattle ranching and dairy farming to examine their effect on dung beetle assemblage metrics guild diversity and spatial turnover . The intermediate grazing intensity of cattle ranching supported a higher abundance and diversity of both whole dung beetle assemblage and the nesting guilds followed by the game ranches and then dairy farms . Differences between the sampling years were dependent on the beetle nesting guild and largely correlated with rainfall and temperature . Cattle and game ranches shared a higher number of species than either shared with dairy farms .

As a notoriously water intensive economic activity mining frequently infringes on other forms of water use . Simultaneously the legal articulations and governance implications of the hydrological aspects of mining are complex as commercial interactions associated with mining span the globe governance efforts occur primarily at the national level and negative externalities manifest locally . Increasingly transnational initiatives play a role in setting rules and norms for responsible or sustainable mining .,Increasingly transnational rule setting also occurs for the mining sector. Provisions for the protection of water resources are not always included. Water is mostly treated as a public health concern sometimes as an economic good. The cultural dimension of water resources often remains unacknowledged. Newer certification schemes and guidelines tend to be more comprehensive.
1370,The multiple positive effects of an active school commute have convinced many cities to promote home school walks among children and increase the awareness of designing healthy child friendly routes . One of the ways to ensure a child friendly and healthy daily walk to school is to increase the greenery that children encounter on their way . This paper aims to evaluate welfare related disparities among children in the visibility of greenery along their home school routes and link them with distributive justice regarding aesthetic appreciation . We hypothesise that children who belong to poor welfare related status group have lower visibility of greenery along their routes to school than other children . Furthermore we hypothesise that aesthetic appreciation provided by the greenery surrounding home school routes is not equitably distributed to all children . For this purpose we conducted a visibility analysis for primary school pupils in Lodz . In particular we quantified the amount of greenery in the visibility areas of 5 10 30 and 50m along the home school routes of children . Our results show that the median visibility of greenery along the home school routes is lower for shorter visibility distances and street trees dense tree and shrub canopies what could be further related to limited aesthetic experiences . We found that children who belong to poor welfare related status group have less greenery along their home school routes than others . This could indicate a distributive environmental injustice may occur not only in terms of the availability of green spaces for inhabitants homes but also reveal disparities in the visibility of greenery during daily commutes . Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on making cities greener . In particular they may be used by urban planners to identify priority streets for implementing urban green initiatives .,The visibility of street trees and dense tree and shrub canopies in an area of 5 and 10m around home school routes is scarce. The median coverage of greenery in the visibility area of 5m around home school routes is equal to 15 . Poor visibility of greenery may indicate limited aesthetic appreciation for children. Environmental injustice can be understood as welfare related inequalities in the visibility of greenery along home school routes among children. Promoting an active home school commute needs urban planning actions towards greening the walking routes.
1371,Biodiversity is vital in the functioning of ecosystems but its permanently being threatened by anthropic impacts derived from productive activities . Thus conservation has become a global challenge . In Chile the dissociation between economic activities and conservation has triggered numerous socio environmental conflicts in recent decades . This work explores how different projects that give rise to these conflicts can represent an underestimated threat to biodiversity .,Mapping of conflict generating projects and conservation efforts in Chile. There is a dissociation between public policies and biodiversity conservation in Chile. Most environmental conflicts in Chile result from energy generation and mining. Most projects associated with conflicts are financed by Chilean companies. 101 conflict generating projects are inside of High Conservation Value Areas.
1372,Urban green spaces provide cultural ecosystem services and urban policies typically aim to enhance these services by targeting new investments in deprived areas . The implementation of urban greening policies is one way to reduce inequalities in well being for example by targeting areas where increased access to green spaces will benefit citizens of low socioeconomic status . Most research has addressed the targeting of green infrastructure development by considering income and access to green spaces while few studies have considered a multidimensional definition of well being . The aims of this paper are to i integrate inputs from the economic and political philosophy literature to propose a broader definition of well being including health education insecurity and social relations ii develop a criterion to prioritise areas where urban greening would have the greatest impact on well being inequalities and iii apply this criterion to the Paris metropolitan area a spatially heterogeneous region where areas deprived of access to green spaces are not systematically deprived in other dimensions . Our analysis shows that the city of Paris and the inner suburbs would be targeted when considering inequality in access to green spaces only . The results differ when inequalities in income or multidimensional well being are taken into account in which case the northern inner suburbs and some outer suburbs become a higher priority .,Green spaces are unequally distributed within the Paris metropolitan area. Targeting areas poorly endowed with green space is likely to favour affluent populations. We propose a new methodology for just green infrastructure development.
1373,Urban green spaces offer a wide range of ecosystem services to city dwellers contributing to their health and well being . The resources of formally designated UGS such as parks and forests are frequently underprovided however . This results in unequal access to UGS which has become an environmental justice issue . We investigated the potential of informal green spaces to complement existing formal UGS to reduce distributional inequity in UGS availability . We focused on the most vulnerable groups of citizens children and elderly residents for whom the availability of UGS plays a particularly important role . The study was performed in two Eastern European cities Warsaw and d both characterised by a well developed system of UGS but of different spatial composition and UGS configuration . We focus on unmanaged areas within IGS and link them to the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services such as enabling direct contact with nature . We identified different categories of formal and informal UGS based on publicly available data supported by NDVI values followed by UGS availability analysis of formal and informal UGS in the service area of 300m for each residential building . We found that informal UGS are equally important as formal ones and they may contribute to better access to selected urban ecosystem services . Both cities are characterised by unequal distribution of formal UGS . In d children are least favoured in terms of UGS availability while in Warsaw elderly citizens are most excluded . In both cities it is the green areas associated with transportation routes communication routes multi family housing and agricultural lands along with grasslands that have the greatest potential to improve the equal availability of UGS to residents . We propose maintaining various types of unmanaged green areas in cities to help limit disparities to UGS access and it would also increase their importance in the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services .,Residents in both Warsaw and d are subject to unequal accessibility to urban green spaces. The greenery associated with transportation routes multi family housing and agriculture have the greatest potential to complement formal UGS. In d it is children who are most disadvantaged in terms of access to UGS while in Warsaw it is elderly citizens. Disparities among children and elderly citizens in access to formal green spaces can be reduced by informal green spaces. Preservation of unmanaged areas can allow access to green spaces and enable more contact with nature close to home.
1374,In a rising urban age planning for cities around the globe is increasingly based on assessments of ecosystem services making enhanced considerations of ecosystem service justice critically important . Yet justice remains a blind spot in urban ecosystem service models and research which can be traced back to the ecological and economic legacies of the concept itself . This legacy reproduces the normative focus on natural capital as a guarantee of sustaining ecosystem services enforces a static understanding of nature that insufficiently considers human agency and conceptualizes ecosystem service flows from nature to humans in a way that does not reflect the social ecological structure and constantly shifting priorities of the urban realm . In response this conceptual paper aims at broadening the analytical foundation for justice in urban ecosystem service assessments by presenting a model that links the co production of urban ecosystem services with established lines of recognition procedural and distributional justice . It further highlights the need to embed these classical dimensions of justice within both spatial and temporal justice frames . Relying on urban environmental social spatial and temporal justice theory as well ecosystem service scholarship we outline theoretical entry points and provide practical examples for weaving notions of justice into urban ecosystem service research and practice while highlighting future research needs .,This study develops an ecosystem service justice model from an urban perspective. Infrastructure institutions and perceptions filter ecosystem services in ways that impact social justice. Spatial justice concerns for ecosystem services account at once for down scale and inter scale relations. Temporal justice concerns for ecosystem services link past present and future conditions of social ecological systems.
1375,Alluvial aquifers in seasonal rivers are a yet underutilised resource in many arid regions of Africa . These so called sand river aquifers provide nature based water storage within easy reach because they are shallow . They form a significant potential renewable source of water for irrigation development . Innovative approaches and solutions are needed to sustainably increase productive use of this resource to enhance rural livelihoods . The A4Labs action research explores the potential and pitfalls of introducing solutions designed for individual smallholder farmers . This entails innovation in three domains the technology used the arrangement and the purpose . Pilots were established in the Limpopo river basin in Zimbabwe and Mozambique . Monitoring and assessment are ongoing but preliminary findings indicate that successful adoption of the approach was not constrained by water availability . Despite the fact that these pilots were established during two subsequent drought years there was no difficulty in accessing freshwater in sufficient quantity . Instead successful adoption depends on previous farming experience market access and the possibility to grow adaptively in terms of technology scale and financial risks . In addition establishing an individual farm to grow cash crops requires acceptance and new skills as irrigation for smallholder farmers in Africa has traditionally been framed as a communal activity in collective irrigation schemes with strong support by outside agencies and with the well known collective action challenges . This action research has also estimated that the potential for upscaling this innovation in the Limpopo river basin is significant .,Sand river aquifers provide potential for individual family focused solar irrigation in arid lands in Africa. Action research in the Limpopo basin aims to bridge the gap between hydrological theory and practical farm experience. Preliminary findings show that it has technical and economic potential and requires an adaptive development approach. Future ambitions include enhanced monitoring of the water source and use and technical performance of frugal innovations. These diverse innovations need better understanding in relation to marketing and families livelihoods and rural networks.
1376,The application of gene drives is a powerful tool to control populations of insects that are agricultural pests vectors of diseases or a threat to biodiversity potentially leading to the local or global eradication of a species . The potential use of gene drive organisms has triggered a heated discussion regarding their environmental impacts and regulatory oversight . However experience exists in assessing the environmental impacts of a number of established agricultural pest control methods that require the release of living organisms that provide high levels of area wide control and that might be irreversible . This includes classical biological control the sterile insect technique the incompatible insect technique that is based on the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by,The application of gene drives is a powerful new tool to control insect populations. Concerns exists regarding the environmental consequences of gene drive applications. Experience in assessing risks of control methods using living organisms exists. We do not envisage any unforeseen novel risks with the use of gene drive organisms. Existing frameworks can assist the risk assessment of insects carrying gene drives.
1377,Water is key to keeping urban areas safe and healthy for humans and hence safe sanitation and waste water treatment is promoted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . We show that emissions from existing state of the art water technologies are problematic from a Planetary Boundaries perspective . The magnitude of the climate change impact in relation to the PB based normalization is much higher than for any other PB . The current paradigm for urban water management needs a radical change for society to be served while emissions are reduced to a level that complies with the Planetary Boundaries .,The UN SDGs are possibly conflicting with the Planetary Boundaries. Four urban water LCA studies are re referenced based on the Planetary Boundaries. Climate change impact from urban water management is massive. Radical changes need to happen for urban water management to be sustainable.
1378,Using a novel agent based model we study how US withdrawal might influence the political process established by the Paris Agreement and hence the prospects for reaching the collective goal to limit warming below 2C . Our model enables us to analyze to what extent reaching this goal despite US withdrawal would place more stringent requirements on other core elements of the Paris cooperation process . We find first that the effect of a US withdrawal depends critically on the extent to which member countries reciprocate others promises and contributions . Second while the 2C goal will likely be reached only under a very small set of conditions in any event even temporary US withdrawal will further narrow this set significantly . Reaching this goal will then require other countries to step up their ambition at the first opportunity and to comply nearly 100 with their pledges while maintaining high confidence in the Paris Agreement s institutions . Third although a US withdrawal will first primarily affect the United States own emissions it will eventually prove even more detrimental to other countries emissions .,We use an agent based model to simulate future interaction under the Paris Agreement. US withdrawal causes negative knock on effects on other countries emissions. This detrimental effect is biggest under otherwise benign model settings. Given re election of Trump 0.1 of model runs stay within the 2C carbon budget.
1379,Worldwide every year 525 000 children under the age of five die from diarrhoea . The simple act of washing hands with soap and water can prevent more than one third of diarrhoeal disease cases . In the densely populated urban areas of the developing world handwashing wastewater is commonly discharged to the environment without any treatment creating unhygienic situations and breeding places for different vectors and wasting a valuable resource . However this relatively clean wastewater can be treated and reused using simple technological solutions . The objective of our water innovation is therefore twofold improving childrens health through stimulating handwashing at schools while at the same time demonstrating the feasibility of water conservation through low tech nature based treatment and safe reuse of handwashing wastewater for irrigation and toilet flushing . To enhance the intrinsic motivation of children and school staff to adopt this innovation four educational games were developed drawing on theories used in gamification of learning such as social learning theory and engagement theories . This paper provides an overview of the games and the main results of the game testing . For promoting hygiene among school children a board and a card game were developed based on the F diagram commonly used by water and sanitation practitioners to illustrate the main routes for pathogen transmissions from faeces . In addition the system linking handwashing wastewater collection treatment and reuse for irrigation and toilet flushing was simulated by the development of two board games which targeted school children school staff and the operators of the treatment system . The prototypes and final versions were tested in two schools in the Oromia region in Ethiopia while the treatment system for handwashing wastewater is located in one school . Children that play tested the games were generally enthusiastic and eager to play repeatedly which demonstrated that board and card games are appropriate tools to engage with this young target group . We conclude that there is a large potential for development use and upscaling of educational games for more sustainable WaSH interventions .,Drawing on theories used in gamification of learning four educational games for improvement of school WaSH in Ethiopia were developed and tested. The games promote hygienic practices and water conservation in schools by introducing low cost treatment and reuse of handwashing wastewater. There is a large potential for development use and upscaling of educational games for more sustainable WaSH interventions.
1380,Conventional state policies for intensive agricultural production in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta prescribe the expansion of large scale water engineering infrastructure . In the upper part of the VMD compounding environmental challenges presented by climate change hydropower development upstream and localised development policies have added greater pressures to rural societies demanding various governance approaches to deal with change . So far considerable attention has been devoted to policy narratives of how the bureaucratic approach shapes flood management delta wide but little is known about the relevant shift towards adaptive governance at the local level . The analysis presented here is based on qualitative data gathered from fieldworks and desk reviews and argues that the North Vam Nao scheme is an exemplary case for policy transformation in the VMD . A hybrid governance paradigm that is characterised by the participatory and hierarchical approaches allows for the shared learning and interactions of knowledge vertically and horizontally among stakeholders . The study presents nuanced implications of the approach in incorporating both integrative and adaptive components into a long term water governance strategy which would serve as a two pronged contribution to effectively manage environmental uncertainties facing the VMD . It also advocates for the legitimacy of the approach to be institutionalised and widely adopted across the Mekong floodplains and beyond .,The North Vam Nao scheme represents a hybrid governance paradigm. The scheme is characterised by the participatory and hierarchical approaches for its irrigation and flood management. Collaborative learning and integration of knowledge among stakeholders take place across vertical and horizontal linkages. The scheme fosters both integrative and adaptive components in its long term water governance strategy.
1381,Nitrogen deposition is one of the main environmental threats to the conservation goals in areas protected by the European Habitats Directive a problem that is quite pronounced in the livestock rich region of Flanders Belgium . Livestock farms are often located close to Natura 2000 areas . Therefore ammonia emissions from livestock housing and manure storage have a high contribution to the deposition in these nearby protected habitats . In order to control this problem the Flemish government imposes restrictions on livestock farms that pose a substantial threat to protected habitats nearby . In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of this spatially differentiated policy . Using an integrated spatially explicit modeling approach we were able to show that the effectiveness of this policy is rather limited in terms of reducing the proportion of habitats in exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen . In order to obtain a good status for all sensitive habitats emission abatement efforts should extend beyond the livestock sector . The effectiveness of the policy is dependent on habitat type and the livestock subsectors contributing to emissions nearby . Furthermore by means of four different habitat classes the effectiveness of alternative policy options can be easily assessed on the level of individual habitats .,We evaluated the Flemish policy to reduce ammonia deposition in Natura 2000 areas. The policy is ineffective in lowering deposition below critical loads. Emission abatement should extend beyond the livestock sector. The cost of abatement differs between livestock subsectors. The effectiveness in individual habitats depends on the sensitivity of the habitat.
1382,Climate change presents significant risks and opportunities for agriculture . Agricultural producers are likely to be adversely affected by changes in higher mean temperatures more frequent extreme climatic events and an increase in inter annual weather variability with implications for established management practices . While probabilities of future change in key climatic variables become more refined significant uncertainties remain complicating efforts at adaptation action on the ground . Adaptation pathways planning allows stakeholders to consider a range of possible futures identify and evaluate adaptation options and sequence them over time . The aim is to have a robust plan that is flexible enough to deliver desired outcomes regardless of how the future unfolds . We developed and applied a pathways approach to support regional adaptation planning in Hawkes Bay New Zealand a premier food and wine producing region where changing land use competition for freshwater and climate change are presenting challenges to agricultural producers and rural communities . Working with a range of stakeholders from local government community and the regions diverse agricultural sectors comparative case study analysis in two catchments is used to identify values relating to productive landscapes likely impacts of climate change and potential adaptation options at the local level . Actions for key areas of decision making were evaluated and sequenced over time providing the basis for a regional adaptation pathway . The results highlight the complex interaction between climatic and non climatic drivers of change at the local and regional scale and the need to closely consider trade offs and synergies in any adaptations . With adaptation rapidly emerging as a priority for policy making and practice the results can help inform and empower stakeholders to implement actions towards climate adapted futures and demonstrate the utility of pathways approaches for local and regional planning .,Assesses adaptation to climate change in agricultural region. Participatory approach used to co create regional adaptation pathway. Adaptations sequenced over time focusing on incremental changes in near term. Highlights long term strategies towards transformation as impacts accelerate. Provides the basis for regional adaptation planning and further application.
1383,This article examines the policy background and legislative frameworks underlying the regulation of transboundary movement of potentially invasive alien species . The starting point is the examination of the fundamental regulatory concepts for IAS that are found in the International Plant Protection Convention in accordance with the World Trade Organisations,Recognition of invasive alien species IAS in international conventions. Different concepts applying to IAS and pests of plants. Transboundary regulation of IAS in federal and transnational jurisdictions. European Union Eurasian Economic Union USA California Australia.
1384,Since first introduced in 2000 water security has grown into a vibrant research area with the majority of studies examining water supply security . Although protection to water related hazards is recognised as a dimension in water security only a few scholars have explicitly put flood related research under the banner of water security . This paper seeks to theorise the position of flooding in the water security conception using the securitisation lens which also influenced early works in the water security field . Securitisation is a process of perceiving an issue as a threat enabling the pursuit of extraordinary measures outside normal politics . I find that water supply security and flood security have the same theoretical root fear of an unknown future . They are based on the notion that threats to the shortage of water and surplus of water respectively create the need for robust policies which often translate into climate proofing infrastructures . Here I propose a conceptual tool to assess the likelihood of a threat to undergo a securitisation process and to help answer why a threat was securitised while others not . This tool is deployed to examine the case of flooding and sinking in Jakarta Indonesia .,It examines how flooding fits in the concept of water security that is dominated by water scarcity research. A framework to assess how securitisation of different water related threats is proposed. It tests the framework with Jakartas sinking crisis and its sea wall plan. It provides insights into a de securitisation moves in water policy. The findings are relevant for evaluating policy process induced by water related threats.
1385,Phosphorus is a critical agricultural nutrient and a major pollutant in waterbodies due to inefficient use . In the form of rock phosphate it is a finite global commodity vulnerable to price shocks and sourcing challenges . Transforming toward sustainable phosphorus management involves local to global stakeholders . Conventional readings of stakeholders may not reflect system complexity leaving it difficult to see stakeholder roles in transformations . We attempt to remedy this issue with a novel stakeholder analysis method based on five qualitative pillars stakeholder agency system roles power and influence alignment to the problem and transformational potential . We argue that our approach suits case studies of individual stakeholders stakeholder groups and organisations with relationships to sustainability challenges .,Stakeholders hold complex roles capacities power. Stakeholders can be read as complex entities within complex social ecological systems. Deeper reading of stakeholders is important for identifying leveragers for sustainability transformations.
1386,Nexus thinking represents a novel approach to managing sustainability challenges but little is known about how and to what extent it is being employed by companies . By examining documents from 14 companies identified as comprehensive disclosers this paper reveals important insights into corporate responses to multiple interconnected sustainability issues or nexus challenges . Using qualitative content analysis of companies responses to the CDP climate change water forests and supply chain surveys as well as their sustainability reports we find that while companies largely continue with silo based approaches to addressing sustainable development challenges some are beginning to employ more integrated approaches suggestive of embryonic nexus thinking . Our research provides the first empirical evidence of its kind and contributes to broader debates on the utility of the nexus concept in corporate environmental governance and policymaking .,Researchers call for nexus thinking beyond energy food water policy considerations. Business plays an underexamined role in interconnected sustainability challenges. Companies responses to nexus challenges are studied using different secondary data. Businesses rely on silo based approaches but also adopt early forms of nexus thinking. We contribute to wider discussions on the importance of nexus approaches.
1387,Pesticides used in agriculture are widely considered to be the most cost effective way to reduce undesirable plants and animal pests and increase crop yields . However these economic benefits should be evaluated against any deleterious impacts on the natural environment and human health . While a great deal of attention is paid to the impact of agricultural runoff more studies are needed on the impacts of pesticides on local waterways . The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to determine which pesticides were being used in local agriculture in the Byron Shire Australia and search the literature for evidence of the impact of these chemicals on local waterways . After a comprehensive search involving multiple government databases three herbicides with potentially high toxicity on the aquatic ecosystems and humans which are used for the treatment of crops cultivated on the agricultural land in the Byron Shire Australia were selected for this review bromoxynil diquat and paraquat . In the systematic scoping review two databases were searched for publications between January 2008 and April 2019 . From 160 articles identified 36 papers were selected for inclusion . The evidence of harmful effects at realistic field concentrations was found for all selected herbicides but not on all organisms . In aquatic environments diquat was found to be toxic to snails and bromoxynil to microalgae . The clearest and most consistent evidence was found for paraquat . At realistic field concentrations paraquat severely inhibited healthy bacterial growth,This study sets out a new method to determine the pesticides likely to be used locally. Bromoxynil diquat and paraquat are the three most toxic pesticides in local use. There is evidence of harmful effects at realistic field concentrations for all three pesticides. The strongest evidence was for paraquat causing negative impacts on aquatic organisms. Paraquat has been banned from use in many countries around the world but not Australia.
1388,Currently Chinas environmental regulations are unprecedentedly strict . At the same time China is emphasizing innovation development in the process of industrial upgrading . However previous literature has not reached a consensus on the relationship between the environmental regulation and innovation . This paper takes the Yangtze River Delta the most developed region in China as an example and uses the spatial econometric model based on the geographic matrix economic matrix and comprehensive relevance matrix of logistics enterprises to fully examine the relationship between urban environmental regulation and innovation development under different spatial interaction perspectives . The results show that the relation between formal environmental regulation and innovation is inverse U shaped . Spatial self selection of environmental regulation in the Yangtze River Delta region weakens the enthusiasm of innovation to a certain extent . This paper argues that the main mechanisms through which environmental regulation affects innovation development are spillover effects and industrial structure effects . Finally the paper proposes corresponding policy recommendations .,This paper investigates the spatial interaction of environmental regulation in the Yangtze River Delta. Examine spatial relationship between environmental regulation and innovation taking into account logistics matrix. Discover inverted U relationship between formal environmental regulation and innovation. Discover that the spatial self selection of environmental regulation is not conducive to innovation development. Found that environmental regulation affects innovation through spillover effect and industrial structure effect.
1389,Achieving the objectives of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Conservation and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks and Sustainable Management of Forests in developing countries will remain an aspiration unless and until the historical contributions of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities to the state and management of forests are recognised and respected . REDD is designed for developing countries where community based forest management systems are becoming increasingly popular . Using the case study of Nepal a pioneer of community forest management we show how the traditional users of Tarai forests are systemically excluded from mainstream CF practices and discuss the potential negative implications of not rewarding their historical contribution . Considering the scope provided by REDD benefit sharing plans and the greater number of developing countries involved in designing BSPs we argue that BSP offers a unique opportunity to recognize historical contributions of traditional users suggest specific provisions for channelling REDD benefits to the traditional users as a potential solution and conclude that the inability to provide such benefits may result in the failure of REDD on a broader scale nullifying global efforts for forest based climate change mitigation .,Knowledge and contribution of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities is critical in REDD success. Benefit Sharing Plan BSP offers an opportunity to recognize historical contributions of traditional users. Inability to resolve context specific benefit sharing issues may result in the failure of REDD . Nepals BSP need to specify the monetary benefits to the traditional distant users of Tarai region.
1390,Contemporary socio environmental problems such as the reduced availability of natural resources the loss of biodiversity soil degradation pollution an unprecedented population growth the mass migration of people to cities and urban sprawl may be associated with the consequences of an economic infinite growth paradigm on a finite planet . Despite international goals for improving the spatial and environmental management current and future developments are continuously planned without the consideration of the biophysical limits to growth . This could be equated with the environmental carrying capacity a concept and a tool for the sustainable development of human settlements . This research use the environmental indicators such as Ecological Footprint and biocapacity for ECC quantification . Despite EF and BC accounting is well developed at the global national and regional levels there is still lack of local urban standard for EF assessment . Therefore the main goal of this study is to present the local approach for EF assessment and its potential to use for ECC assessment at local level . The study compares the hybrid EF which joined the bottom up CF with the remaining EFs components from a top down approach with the standard top down EF approach . In this study the assessment focused mainly on household consumption which could be equated as main driver responsible for Ecological Footprint . Thus the impact of household consumption was quantified according to four categories reflecting resources use and waste generation as,The EF and BC were applied for environmental carrying capacity assessment. Hybrid EF joining bottom up CF with remaining top down EF components was presented. Proper correspondence between TD and BU categories avoids risk of double counting. The quality of input data should be assessed to determine best outcome combination. A hybrid datasets can be a cost effective approach relevant to local policy.
1391,Climate change policy for the land sector is challenged by complex biophysical and socioeconomic contexts . A target approach utilising land use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission reductions . This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits with uptake typically supported by grant incentives . A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments . Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration referenced against biophysical data showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture usually on wetter uncultivated semi natural land often on organic soils . This acts to constrain net carbon gains . Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations regardless of biophysical opportunities highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors . Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups . Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land which will constrain long term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly . Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets as headline progress indicators can be misleading potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets . A more spatially targeted approach is required to maximise GHG reductions relative to local contexts . Recommendations are made for improved measures that recognise spatial and temporal variability as exemplified by certification schemes .,Climate change policy targets are compared with empirical land use changes for afforestation and peatland restoration. New woodland in Scotland shown to occur mainly on land marginal for agriculture and uncultivated areas. Peatland restoration tends to cluster in some locations and not others. Socioeconomic factors explaining afforestation and peatland restoration are explored. Limitations of symbolic targets for land use change identified due to spatial and temporal variations in GHG emissions.
1392,Urban parks provide multiple ecosystem services to mitigate challenges from climate change and urbanisation . They promote health and well being by providing space for physical activity and social interaction which is particularly relevant for vulnerable groups such as children and older people . As a key element park vegetation creates favourable environments as it moderates heat buffers noise and can be enjoyed by citizens . In this paper we present the results of a multi method empirical study conducted in the city of Leipzig Germany during the summer heat and drought period in July 2018 . Visitation patterns were analysed through qualitative observation and structured counting in two differently characterised urban parks a newly developed urban park on a former railway brownfield and a long standing older park with a mature tree population . The results indicate that park design elements are linked to park use activities and park user age groups such as young children school children and older people . Young children were identified as mostly using playgrounds and natural lawn areas in the old park while school children and teenagers tended to use the sports areas and semi secluded spaces in the newly developed park to play sports or to meet in groups and socialize . For older people sedentary activity was exclusively observed on benches and non sedentary activity such as jogging was nearly exclusively identified in the larger more shaded older park . The number of counted park users particularly numbers of children and older people significantly declined at the highest temperature of approximately 30C . Considering the provision and availability of inclusive design elements that support these use behaviours may increase the motivation of all age groups to use green spaces and to benefit from the services they provide . Planning for a more effective and just provision of ecosystem services requires the consideration of age specific design elements to invite use from all population groups equally and to contribute to distributional justice .,An empirical multi method study assessed park visitor patterns during 2018 summer heat. Two differently characterized parks differ in their cooling function. Temperature threshold of around 30C was identified where numbers for jogging and playing with children declined. Age groups based activities in parks are linked to park design characteristics.
1393,In this paper we assess the sustainability of Variable Rate Technology application for different wheat intensive agricultural areas in Europe . Within the H2020 FATIMA project we developed an analytical framework to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of nutrient management in two Case Studies in Greek and Czech Republic implemented with different fertilization strategies in the winter wheat production compared with the conventional one .,Water Energy Food nexus approach was applied to evaluate the impact of Variable Rate Technology at farm level for a sustainable use of nitrogen. The results show the importance for farmers of managing inputs in an efficient way in order to obtain economic and environmental benefits. The adoption of VRT in input management can provide important benefits both under economic and environmental perspective.
1394,Plastic pollution is a global environmental concern and several approaches have been implemented seeking to reduce and control releases of plastic waste especially in marine environments . Recently disclosure of data on occurrence of single use plastic straws among the litter collected in beach cleaning campaigns unleashed a worldwide movement that resulted on banning of these items in several countries . The market then quickly began to offer sustainable solutions as the professed biodegradable plastic straws . However cases of greenwashing added to current limitations related to the technical standards used to attest biodegradability of commercial plastic products may lead these measures to be largely ineffective . Herein a case study assessing the composition of plastic straws marketed in Brazil and United States under false claims of biodegradability was used as background for discussion of this neglected issue which goes far beyond plastics straws . Thus although some local regulations have already banned single use plastic products additional actions in regional and global scales should be implemented especially concerning proper labeling of the alleged biodegradable products . Therefore from a multi dimensional perspective and considering the resistance of the powerful plastic industry multiple management strategies focused on educating people in the matters of deciding purchases based on correct labeling and properly discarding the waste are possibly our best chance to drive a positive global environmental change . Additionally we also suggest the inclusion of this relevant subject among the tasks proposed by the Basel Convention Partnership on Plastic Waste .,So called biodegradable plastics and greenwashing are issues of environmental concern. Cases of false claims of biodegradability in plastic products are becoming frequent. Appropriate labeling rules for biodegradable products should be implemented.
1395,Recent studies argue that the scientific communication of climate change overly emphasizes climate extremes . This in turn leads to a universal atmosfear as an association of anthropogenic climate change with frightening future scenarios . We analyze the factors driving such kinds of atmosfear concerning the particular cases of hot extremes and wet extremes . Can uncertainty or fear motivate resilience or even initiate action to cope with potential future challenges A transition is needed in the current public discourse on climate change from atmosfear to orchestrated global climate action to rapidly induce the social and behavioral changes that are fundamental to meet climate policy objectives . The current climate change debate is largely framed in terms of risks and damages . However we argue that positive messages could serve climate action better . We list several positive examples resulting from action against climate change co benefits win win or multiple win opportunities that climate action might entail .,Factors driving atmosfear as association of anthropogenic climate change with frightening future scenarios are analyzed. A transition is needed in the public discourse on climate change from atmosfear to orchestrated global climate action. We argue that positive messages could serve climate action better and list several positive examples.
1396,Organic food has important environmental and health benefits decreasing the toxicity of agricultural production improving soil quality and overall resilience of farming . Increasing consumers demand for organic food reinforces the rate of organic farming adoption and the level of farmers risk acceptance . Despite the recorded 20 growth in organically managed farmland its global land area is still far less than expected only 1.4 . Increasing demand for organic food is an important pathway towards sustainable food systems . We explore this consumer centric approach by developing a theoretically and empirically grounded agent based model . Three behavioral theories theory of planned behavior alphabet theory and goal framing describe individual food purchasing decisions in response to policies . We take wine sector as an example to calibrate and validate the model for the case study of Sydney Australia . The discrepancy between consumer intention and purchasing behavior for organic wine can be explained by a locked in vicious cycle . We assess the effectiveness of different policies such as wine taxation and informational education campaigns to influence consumer choices . The model shows that these interventions are non additive raising consumer awareness and increasing tax on less environmentally friendly wines simultaneously is more successful in promoting organic wine than the sum of the two policies introduced separately . The phenomenon of undercover altruism amplifies the preference for organic wine and the tipping point occurs at around 35 diffusion rate in the population . This research suggests policy implications to help decision makers in the food sector make informed decisions about organic markets .,Alternative theories explaining behavioral changes are complementary. An agent based model helps to analyze organic vice food purchasing behavior. Market and informational policies jointly produce non additive effects. Locked in vicious cycle can explain the intention behavior gap for organic wine. Organic adaption tipping point is detected at 35 of diffusion rate
1397,As key venues for interaction and cooperation international river basin organizations are significant contributors to hydrodiplomacy in transboundary river basins . As part of their efforts to support hydrodiplomacy IRBOs engage in the production and use of science . The manner in which that science is produced and how it contributes to hydrodiplomacy is not well understood . This paper examines the production and use of science by three IRBOs the International Joint Commission the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River and the Mekong River Commission . We find the science produced by the IRBOs to support hydrodiplomacy extends beyond measuring and monitoring to include more advanced and analytical forms of science . In producing science we observe that the IRBOs balance considerations of capacity ownership and how the politics of the basin will influence the production and use of the science . Given the challenge of balancing across these considerations future research is needed to determine what mechanisms and processes for producing science can best facilitate its use in hydrodiplomacy .,IRBOs are key institutions supporting hydrodiplomacy in transboundary river basins. IRBOs produce and use science to support hydrodiplomacy. When producing science IRBOs balance capacity ownership and politics.
1398,In the wake of controversies surrounding both the legitimacy and effectiveness of intergovernmental expert organisations the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services was established in 2012 as a new intergovernmental expert organisation with the explicit mandate to move beyond one size fits it all approaches . During its first eight years of operating this attempt to do different has made IPBES develop into a space for individual experiential and organisational learning and has made significant progress towards becoming a learning organisation . However learning can take different forms . Looking towards the future development of IPBES the importance of transformative learning and the need to establish institutional reflexive processes in which this transformative learning can take place will be critical . IPBES has a number of novel features three key features facilitating transformative learning are its ambitious principles and inclusive approach to a wide range expertise and knowledges its fellowship programme and commitment to a transparent and on going review process . While IPBES social organisation is significantly different from previous initiatives and has created opportunities for transformative learning not all learning and all changes that have taken place have been reflexive and some innovative features also have had unintended consequences for the results of the learning activities . As a result to live up to its ambitions of contributing to positive and transformative societal and environmental change IPBES must strengthen its capacity for transformative learning . Some proposals on how to systemise it further are outlined .,Transformations ought to be pursued reflexively. Different spaces and forms of learning take place within IPBES. IPBES needs to strengthen its capacity for transformative learning. We outline what the missions of a reflexivity officer could look like.
1399,The attractiveness and urbanisation of coastal zones increase their vulnerability to climate change and sea level rise in particular to flooding and marine erosion . In the face of the projected increase in losses and damages the anticipation and measures needed for adaptation involve physical socioeconomic and political dimensions at different governance levels and timescales . A large literature addresses these various issues generally in a targeted way . Drawing on adaptive policy pathways approaches and on research results of the past decade in mainland France this article proposes an interdisciplinary characterisation of long term adaptation pathways in coastal areas . Among the different variables and processes of change that characterise coastal zones and their future particular emphasis is placed on social and institutional dynamics . This work contributes to the debate about adaptive governance in a highly uncertain context as well as to recent work to explore pathways and tipping points in support of climate adaptation policies .,This article explores adaptation pathways to climate change in coastal areas. Six territorial archetypes are defined to be representative of the French coastal territories. The pathways identify different and common resources and levers for each archetype. A rapid rise in sea level reduces adaptation capacities for structural changes. An ambitious and early mitigation policy results in more robust adaptation pathways.
1400,As climate change erodes current levels of flood protection in the UK and government investment in hard flood risk management is rationed by cost benefit ratios the option for many communities at risk is to implement local soft FRM . The frequency of widespread flooding generates an added urgency to understand how to support sFRM . Using a case study and qualitative analysis we explore social processes such as acculturation that drive stakeholder adaptation to be more flood resilient . We conceptualise the status quo beleaguered by conflict and competition and propose practices of accommodation and cooperation that can support shared objectives and responsibility that strengthen sFRM . Our conceptual model is mapped on a stylised catchment to illustrate how SPs underpin sFRM interventions that join up the catchment in wholescape thinking . The transferable learning is that there are group behaviours and inclusive practices that can initiate and support local sFRM .,As soft FRM sFRM is more widely implemented this brings in social elements. Underlying social processes SPs can strengthen sFRM joining up catchments. The SPs of Accommodation Coordination and Acculturation foster shared objectives. Inclusive practices of visioning and partnering are key activities for local groups.
1401,In this paper we examine how cities are working with nature based solutions for biodiversity . Drawing on a sample of 199 nature based solutions across Europe we identify how cities work with nature based solutions to,European cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature based solutions using quantitative targets. The Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework should incorporate the goals of Conserve Restore and Thrive that cities pursue for biodiversity. Urban NBS need to further integrate biodiversity goals as well as restoration actions that emphasize species and genetic diversity.
1402,Effective designation of Protected Areas requires the careful consideration of their social impacts as these are perceived by people . These refer to a variety of issues such as the distribution of power social equity social relations and more importantly the impact of PAs on human wellbeing . A number of studies have emerged in the past decade aiming to capture social impacts of PAs across the world through non monetary assessments taking into consideration peoples perceptions . Although Europe is the region with the largest in proportion number of Protected Areas across the world it is also a region with very limited scientific evidence on this topic . As the European Union is preparing to implement its new Biodiversity Strategyto ipkmplement this paper aims to provide the first comprehensive review of the literature regarding social impacts of European PAs and highlight new directions for current policy frameworks in the region . The paper focuses on the perceived non economic social costs and benefits of PAs and identifies 7 key categories of social impacts . We propose that policy planning for biodiversity conservation in Europe should incorporate subjective assessments of social costs and benefits with the aim to achieve an increase of benefits for people and their equal distribution across social groups .,Seven categories of social impacts were identified in the literature review. Most important negative impacts are on human rights and social equity. Most important positive impacts are on wellbeing and livelihoods. There is need to increase subjective assessment of impacts in protected areas. Coordination of policies across sectors is needed to meet future biodiversity targets.
1403,Climate changes and associated impacts are placing pressure on institutions and the professionals working within them to become proactive and to plan for more extreme impacts in distant futures . Despite a growing recognition of the need for climate adaptation action there are limited assessment frameworks and strategic evaluation resources to support our understanding of regional adaptive capacity . We build on the literature and on information provided by climate adaptation experts to design a multi criterion framework called the Regional Fingerprint . This framework consists of five critical categories adopted actions institutional capacity research quality planning processes and regional collaboration and twenty one evaluation criteria . The framework is designed to uncover asymmetries between places identify opportunities for intervention and track progress in adaptive capacity . We further applied this framework to regions in California to test its viability and glean insights into the frameworks capacity to generate new and useful policy relevant information . Through this work we find that the Regional Fingerprint offers insights into adaptive capacity and can be used to highlight critical areas for strategic intervention by state and local planners .,The role of governance institutions and management in regional adaptive capacity is emphasized. A framework to assesses regional adaptive capacity of governance systems is proposed. Framework encompasses adopted actions institutional capacity research quality planning processes and collaboration. Insights from the assessment include asymmetries between places and opportunities for interventions. Provides a foundation and method for future assessments in other places and contexts.
1404,The state of the environment continues declining despite improved global responses towards environmental protection . This mismatch could be because government policymakers and bureaucrats tend to focus on the tangible and controllable aspects of interventions such as resources and actions rather than the consequences of these interventions . We test this assumption by classifying governance indicators in the environmental sector according to a logic model an evidence based causal chain articulating the causes effects and consequences of management interventions . In this paper we synthesized consensus on logic models and developed a decision tree to classify governance indicators depending on whether they measured,The state of the environment keeps declining despite increased government efforts. We ask if this is caused by governance indicators that measure effort and efficiency rather than effectiveness. We categorise governance indicators in the South African environmental sector according to a causal logic model. Most governance indicators are at the wrong level of the logic model and do not measure government effectiveness as intended. This may explain why the state of environment keeps declining even when government consistently meets performance targets.
1405,The missing link between cross sectoral resource management and full scale adoption of the water energy food nexus has been the lack of analytical tools that provide evidence for policy and decision making . This study defined WEF nexus sustainability indicators from where an analytical model was developed to manage WEF resources in an integrated manner using the Analytic Hierarchy Process . The model established quantitative relationships among WEF sectors simplifying the intricate interlinkages among resources using South Africa as a case study . A spider graph was used to illustrate sector performance as related to others whose management is viewed either as sustainable or unsustainable . The model was then applied to assess progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in South Africa . The estimated integrated indices of 0.155 and 0.203 for 2015 and 2018 respectively classify South Africas management of resources as marginally sustainable . The model is a decision support tool that highlights priority areas for intervention .,WEF nexus sustainability indicators are a means of assessing resource management in an integrated manner. The developed model eliminated a silo approach in resource development by assessing resource management as a single unit. The model has established numerical relationships among the WEF nexus indicating priority areas for intervention. The model assessed the progress towards achieving related SDGs to achieve sustainability by 2030.
1406,High water availability enhances agricultural performance and food security . However many countries where water is abundant according to hydrological indicators face difficulties in the utilization of water in agriculture being in a situation of economic water scarcity due to lack of institutional and material means for water management and governance . EWS faces a stronger challenge of measurability if compared to physical water scarcity . Since the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator on Integrated management of domestic and transboundary water resources is a unique attempt to quantify information on water management at a national level we explore whether it can represent a valid metric for EWS measurement . We first show that a high level of water management is neither necessarily associated to high economic power of the country nor to low physical water availability . Then we analyze whether the indicator can predict typical EWS situations such as low agricultural productivity and inefficient water use . Although the importance of water institutions for agriculture is well known through case studies at the local level we make the first attempt to quantify the strengths of this relation at a global scale for different crops in climatic diverse countries . We detect a positive and significant association between IWRM level and yield and consequently a negative and equally significant association between the IWRM level and the crop water footprint . Statistical significance holds also when potentially confounding variables are included in a multiple regression analysis . We infer from this analysis that good water management as detectable through the IWRM indicator improves land productivity and water saving in turn mitigating EWS . Our findings pave the way toward the use of the IWRM indicator as a valuable tool for measuring EWS in agriculture bridging the measurability gap of economic water scarcity with straightforward policy implications in favour of investments in water management as a lever for enhancing food security and development .,Economic water scarcity hinders food security but faces the challenge of measurability. The SDG indicator Integrated Water Resource Management IWRM could measure economic water scarcity. Good IWRM is not always associated to high countrys income or to physical water scarcity. Globally the impact of IWRM on agricultural yield is positive and statistical significant. Higher IWRM is significantly associated to lower water footprint and to water saving.
1407,Crop booms in forest frontiers are a major contributor to land conversion and deforestation . In this study we investigate the smallholder driven northern Laos rubber boom in two case study areas with different speed and intensity of rubber expansion . We assess the relative importance of market contextual and behavioral factors in fostering or hindering the conversion of forest to rubber plantations . We develop a Bayesian network model of land use change based on household surveys expert interviews market price data and land use maps covering the period 20002017 . We use regression analysis to inform the structure of the BN compare model results and analyze time varying effects . The BN and regression models incorporate perceived price signals as a combination of market price and local price knowledge and local self reinforcing imitation dynamics as a combination of aggregate rubber conversion and imitation behavior elicited in the survey . Results show that deforestation was lower in strictly protected areas but not in forests with lesser protection status . Imitation had a large effect on rubber uptake in both areas . In the CSA that experienced the most intensive spread of rubber price signals transmitted through social networks had a significant impact especially throughout the stage of rapid expansion . Rubber expansion continued in both areas during periods of descending prices mainly because of increased cash availability and access to inputs . Our research sheds light on the underlying dynamics of crop booms and contributes to the understanding of agricultural expansion processes .,We analyze drivers of rubber expansion in northern Laos in 20002017. We use a combination of Bayesian network BN modeling and regression analysis. The effect of rubber price on rubber uptake was large during the expansion stages. Local self reinforcing imitation was significant during the expansion and later stages. Designating protected forest areas reduced deforestation.
1408,In Mauritius island in the Indian Ocean as in most low lying coastal areas and Small Island Developing States in particular coastal risks affect community livelihood economic prosperity and the degradation of natural ecosystems . Risks of coastal erosion and marine flooding result both from climate related ocean changes and anthropogenic drivers such as inappropriate coastal development and structural protection measures . Poor development planning and lack of coordination between public and private actors have increased the exposure of human assets along the Mauritius coastline . To reduce these risks the government leads risk reduction activities in coastal zones functioning on a centralized top down governance approach . In recent years this governance framework has been evolving by opening up participatory channels and exploring a long term adaptation perspective . Progress is driven by international engagements and demonstration projects to embrace soft measures nature based options and integrated solutions . We review a selection of pilot projects undertaken by the government that illustrate flexibility in a learning by doing model . However we find that certain governance arrangements do not allow to draw the most from ad hoc projects because they do not feed into a long term comprehensive plan . We consider the role of evidence and risk assessments learning processes and coordination mechanisms as key governance mechanisms required for a robust and evolving national coastal risk reduction and adaptation policy framework .,Pilot projects for coastal risk reduction. Identifying governance arrangements to support long term adaptation. Learning by doing model for long term adaptation.
1409,Coastal flood risk reduction presents a significant public funding challenge due to its high upfront costs and long term benefits and this challenge will increase with future sea level rise . The funding challenge necessarily involves multiple levels of government due to the regional nature of CFRR public goods involved . Yet there has been little research comparing such multilevel arrangements across countries and in particular exploring the performance of public funding arrangements for providing coastal flood risk reduction . We address this gap applying fiscal federalism to develop a multilevel governance analysis of public decision making and fiscal authorities for CFRR in the Netherlands Germany the UK and Australia . For each country we locate key decision making and fiscal authorities in multilevel governance arrangements and analyse their alignment with the benefits of CFRR measures . We find diverse coastal flood risk governance arrangements ranging from highly centralised mixed arrangements involving regional centralisation or partial devolvement to full decentralisation . Further we find that in accordance with fiscal federalism multilevel coastal flood risk governance arrangements are generally reflective of the distribution of the benefits across different levels of government with some exceptions . Finally exploring the outlook of current arrangements under sea level rise we find that major fiscal redistributions may be put under pressure by rising costs likely under SLR and future coastal development . This is particularly the case for those systems which operate under hazard based as opposed to risk based coastal protection policies . Further we find that both fully and moderately decentralised arrangements may require greater central support for alternative measures such as retreat in light of growing financial burdens on local governments .,We compared multilevel coastal flood risk reduction governance and public finance in the UK Germany the Netherlands and Australia. We evaluated alignment of multilevel governance arrangements to spillovers from coastal risk reduction based on fiscal federalism. We find diverse coastal flood risk governance arrangements ranging from highly centralised to full decentralisation. We find that multilevel coastal flood risk governance arrangements are reflective of the distribution of the benefits across different levels of government. We find that major fiscal redistributions may be put under pressure by rising costs under SLR and coastal development.
1410,Effective management of invasive alien species requires comprehensive stakeholder engagement and a clear understanding of how people interact with these species . Such interactions are particularly complex in socio ecological production landscapes and seascapes where local communities and their environment are highly inter dependent . We reviewed the scientific literature to determine current views of the positive and negative effects of IAS on local communities in SEPLS with the goals of better understanding interactions between people and IAS and devising effective management strategies . Of the 105 IAS investigated in the 57 journal papers we found on the topic 31 species were reported as being purely undesirable for the local communities while 30 species were reported as purely desirable and 44 species were both undesirable and desirable . We found that the instrumental value of IAS often constitutes these desirable effects and that desirable IAS were likely to invite controversy among stakeholders over its management . A common compromise to address such conflicts was to work with stakeholders for the containment of the IAS while at the same time to retain or amplify its desirable effects on people to ensure their involvement . In the long run however IAS management in SEPLS can not be exempted from the need for long term goals and the strategy leading toward them . Such a strategy should devise practical tools such as stringent risk assessment and black and white listing as well as an option to eradicate or replace highly invasive species that fully takes into account different perspectives about IAS .,Many invasive alien species in production lands and seas are beneficial. Their instrumental values in people s livelihoods often constitute such benefits. Beneficial invasive alien species tend to invite conflicts over their management. A common short term solution of such conflicts was identified.
1411,Achieving land degradation neutrality was adopted by countries in 2015 as one of the targets of the global Sustainable Development Goals . As LDN is a relatively new concept there is an increasing need for evidence on the potential socio economic and environmental benefits of LDN as well as how an enabling environment for implementing LDN measures can be developed . This paper summarises the results from a global survey of LDN stakeholders and a review of national progress in target setting that was commissioned by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 2018 . The study presents the perceptions of relevant stakeholders on the key components of an enabling environment for achieving and maintaining LDN as well as expectations of multiple benefits from its implementation . We also highlight key challenges and gaps in progress to date that are emerging from ongoing national target setting programs to implement LDN . The study finds that progress in implementing LDN has been widespread across countries . However there remains a lack of awareness of LDN and its key concepts along with high level political buy in . This may be impeding the integration of LDN into national development planning and budgeting processes where progress was assessed as limited . National capacities for securing land tenure and governance arrangements and integrated land use planning were perceived as comparatively low further hampering the implementation of LDN . Despite these gaps most stakeholders who participated in the global survey expected LDN to deliver a broad range of multiple benefits for human wellbeing livelihoods and the natural environment . We argue that greater efforts are needed to raise awareness of LDN educate core stakeholders in its concepts enablers and benefits raise its political profile and provide evidence on national measures that will support implementation of LDN .,We identify 15 elements of an enabling environment for LDN. We survey LDN stakeholders to seek their views on progress and importance. High stakeholder expectations that achieving LDN could provide multiple benefits. National progress is widespread but gaps in awareness buy in and capacity remain. Greater efforts are needed to educate and raise awareness and profile of LDN.
1412,This paper introduces a novel triple bottom line sustainability assessment to evaluate the water energy food nexus of desalination for agriculture . Falling technology costs and rising water scarcity worldwide make desalination an increasingly attractive proposition and agriculture is one of the main sectors grappling with its potential impacts . To explore this issue we combine a wide range of primary and secondary environmental economic and social data with a triple bottom line WEF nexus analysis to demonstrate both the holistic sustainability impacts of desalination for agriculture and the multi sectoral policy environment within which desalination is adopted . We apply this approach to 54 privately owned desalination plants that treat brackish groundwater for agricultural use in the San Quintn Valley of Baja California Mexico . We find that subsidized energy for local agribusinesses plays an important role in making desalination economically viable in the region . This in turn fuels a large agricultural export industry that represents a significant virtual water transfer to the US market . Rapid population growth in the area driven by agricultural labor needs exacerbates the issues of social equity and sustainability that these subsidies and transfers raise . We conclude with a discussion of how to manage these identified trade offs across the water energy food nexus .,We use a novel triple bottom line water energy food nexus methodology. We evaluate sustainability of desalination for agriculture in San Quintn Mexico. Energy subsidies play a key role in making desalination economically viable. Desalination and other technologies have intensified labor migration and water use. Desalination is currently unsustainable but with potential for policy intervention.
1413,Participatory forestry needs to revisit the notion of what participation means rather than uncritically follow the technobureaucratic guidelines of baseline assessment and monitoring . In this study we are concerned about materialism and idealism in the policy and practice of participatory mangrove rehabilitation in the Philippines . The analysis is based on the review of mangrove policies and a case study of a successful project the Katunggan Ecopark . Empowerment does not necessarily follow a bottom up strategy but is given as an impetus by the traditional authority after capitalizing on the rhetoric of participation and limiting the decision making power of the members of the community during the incipient stages of the project . This has put the local communities to work despite having anxieties over the projects positive promises . Social cohesion a volunteer network and the communitys sense of ownership of the success of the project that was not previously felt before can be gained through evidence from the material success of rehabilitation . With the transformation of the denuded area to a mangrove forest power was decentralized from the local government authority to the peoples organization . Recognizing the difference between the materialist and idealist perspectives and learning to negotiate between the two can significantly inform pragmatic approaches to environmental policy and governance . More studies that reflect on the inconsistencies and biases of the materialist idealist divide in both policy and practice should be done to further our understanding of a dynamic flexible and transformative participatory process .,Participatory forestry should be reflective about the materialist idealist divide and its inconsistencies in both policy and practice. Policies should look beyond the conventional measures of success and consider the transforming network among interest groups. Decentralization of power is given as an impetus by the traditional authority after capitalizing on the rhetoric of participation. Long term sustainability would come to emerge when tangible benefits are perceived as instrumental to human wellbeing.
1414,The widespread historical and ongoing abandonment of agricultural lands worldwide presents important opportunities for promoting climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration . The default management outcome of abandonment is natural regeneration through ecological succession . However several different management strategies and new land uses for abandoned agricultural lands have been recommended by the scientific community in recent years . This paper reviews the foremost proposed strategies and compares their soil carbon sequestration potentials . Six major categories have been proposed globally . Each proposal has positive and negative outcomes depending on site specific factors and management objectives . Accordingly no single strategy is ideal in all scenarios and a combination of strategies addresses multiple rural development goals concurrently . A combination of passive and active management techniques is the most effective approach for maximizing soil carbon sequestration over large geographic scales while other strategies can be designed to also promote low carbon land use practices and fossil fuel substitution . The implications of each proposal highlighted here demonstrates the positive role that abandoned agricultural lands can serve in climate change mitigation efforts supporting policymakers tasked with planning the future of regions undergoing abandonment .,Six management strategies are proposed globally following farmland abandonment. A combination of strategies achieves multiple rural development goals. Combining passive and active management can maximize soil carbon sequestration. Abandoned agricultural lands are potential resources for climate change mitigation.
1415,This article analyses the denialist narratives of the negative environmental impact of oil palm plantations on tropical peat by the media of Indonesia Malaysia and Singapore . Specifically we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made . We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer reviewed science consensus view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires . Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by,The article analyses the media portrayal of peatland agricultural practices. We focus on the narratives surrounding the 2016 International Peat Congress. It finds four denialist narratives in defending existing unsustainable practices. These frames bear resemblance to climate change denialism.
1416,The polluting of marine ecosystems with plastics is both a global and a local problem with potentially severe consequences for wildlife economic activity and human health . It is a problem that originates in countries inability to adequately manage the growing flow of waste . We use an impact pathway framework to trace the flow of plastics through the socio ecological system and identify the role of specific policy instruments in achieving behavioral changes to reduce marine plastic waste . We produce a toolbox for finding a policy that is suitable for different countries . We use the impact pathway and toolbox to make country specific recommendations that reflect the reality in each of the selected countries .,An impact pathway framework traces the flow of plastics through the socioeconomic system. We identify key policy entry points and associated policy instruments. Policy instruments range from traditional market based to behavioral tools. We produce a toolbox for policy design that is responsive to measurable indicators. We apply the impact pathway and toolbox to make country specific recommendations.
1417,The Catchment Based Approach was established in 2013 to drive collaborative water management across England . Globally unique in its national coverage CaBA encompasses 106 river catchment partnerships that either incorporate or work with a range of cross sector partner organisations including environmental organisations Government agencies water companies local authorities businesses and civil society . The partnerships work through consensus to build social capital and deliver environmental improvements . Because of the variety of stakeholders and interests represented partnerships attract a range of funds multiplying the core monies they receive from Government . A National Support group several thematic working groups and a team of technical specialists help to build expertise within partnerships . Supported by data and evidence including that derived through citizen science the partnerships have developed catchment plans that capture priorities for action . Challenges of legitimacy funding integration with Englands wider water management framework and the monitoring of outcomes remain . Future opportunities exist including closer alignment with academia and the potential for CaBA to undertake a key role in delivering the UK Governments 25 Year Environment Plan . Several lessons learnt from the CaBA approach may be applicable internationally .,The Catchment Based Approach embeds a collaborative approach to water management. River catchment partnerships are established across the whole of England. Multi sector organisations work collaboratively to deliver environmental benefits. A national framework of support drives capacity and expertise in the partnerships. Challenges exist but the approach can play a key role in catchment management
1418,The sustainability of the environmental management programs such as watershed intervention program relies on the understanding of the nexus of the communitys perception participation and livelihoods . However there are little studies on the interactions of these very important parameters . This study examined the nexus of farmers perception participation livelihoods and their implication for sustaining watershed management program in Ethiopia case of upper Gibe basin . To this end household survey focus group discussion and key informant interview were employed to collect and analyze the data . Likert scale was used to rate the indicators or items of perception participation socio ecological indicators Coefficient of Crobach alpha to test the reliability of items Independent,The sustainability of the environmental management programs relies on the nexus of the communitys perception participation adoption and livelihood. Local communities were well aware of the problems of watershed deterioration and outcome of mitigation measures. The overall community participation index value showed moderate levels of participation indicating that only some decisions were taken in consultation with local people. Specific adoption rates for many of the practices and the intensity of adoption were low. There were gaps in the progress of the five dimensions of livelihood assets human natural financial social and physical.
1419,Sustainable development is a long term endeavour involving deep uncertainty and requiring transformative change at multiple scales . To navigate such a grand challenge new approaches have been developed in various academic fields such as Policy Analysis and Sustainability Transitions . Two prominent approaches to strategic planning within these two fields are Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty and Transition Management . While DMDU provides analytical concepts and tools to,DMDU and TM are two separate fields concerned with strategic planning. DMDU helps decision makers to prepare for change TM helps to condition change. Strategic planning for sustainable development could benefit from an integration. DMDU is an analytic approach TM is interventionist. TM could develop transition pathways DMDU could operationalise them.
1420,This paper explores the implications of the widespread success of the term circular economy in the institutional and public debate . The concept of circular economy in itself implies a logical contradiction on the one hand the concept acknowledges the dependence of the economy on biophysical flows on the other hand the proposed solutiona business model guaranteeing a full decoupling of the economy from natural resourcesseemingly ignores that biophysical processes are subject to thermodynamic constraints . A biophysical view of the sustainability predicamentthe flows exchanged between the technosphere and the biosphere is depicted to show that the idea of a full decoupling is simply due to ignorance of the knowledge generated in disciplinary scientific fields other than the dominant economic one . The success of economics as an elite folk science is explained by the need of the establishment to ignore uncomfortable knowledge that would destabilize existing institutions . The success of the term circular economy can be seen as an example of socially constructed ignorance in which folk tales are used to depoliticize the sustainability debate and to colonize the future through the endorsement of implausible socio technical imaginaries . A strategy that can lead to an irresponsible management of expectation implausible master narratives are impossible to govern . Rather than continuing to impose technocratic plans as if we knew the optimal thing to do Post Normal Science suggests that it is much more effective and responsible to adopt a flexible management approach exploring the ability of self organization of social ecological systems .,The term Circular Economy acknowledges the biophysical roots of the economic process. The entropic nature of the economy entails that decoupling is impossible. Economics needs to recognize the relevance of other inter disciplinary knowledge. Policy legends are used to protect the establishment from uncomfortable knowledge. Post Normal Science is needed to avoid the ancient regime syndrome attractor.
1421,This paper introduces an environment driven artificial intelligence model for sustainable policymaking in the European countries focusing on Ukraine . It develops regional clusters using artificial neural networking and then it dynamically optimises budgeting allocations . It is a hybrid environment driven model which i clusters regionalised data using Kohonens self organising map and ii optimises budget allocations using simplex modified distribution method .

Simplex algorithm verifies the economic optimality of the environmental clusters. Budget allocation planning according to the socio environmental indicators. The intelligent environmental plan ensures environmental funding flexibility.
1422,The empirical findings regarding the transfer validity of benefit transfer methods for environmental policy evaluation have been mixed . In this paper the value function from a contingent valuation exercise that estimates the value to the Irish general public of achieving good ecological status as specified in the Water Framework Directive are transferred to a spatial microsimulated population within individual water management units across Ireland . The welfare estimates from this novel value function based transfer approach are compared against the results from previous primary valuation studies in one of the WMUs and transfer errors are found to be low . The proposed spatial microsimulation value transfer approach controls for the heterogeneous distribution of populations across the WMUs and for the fact that the willingness to pay will vary according to an individuals geographic proximity to the water body within each catchment and with the current ecological status of the WMU .,Value transfer for estimation of water quality benefit values to society. Transferring contingent valuation function using spatial microsimution approach. More accurate as control for differences in site quality and commodity consistency
1423,This paper interrogates the parallel goals of global environmental assessments to be both authoritative and meaningful sources of environmental expertise . It explores authority and meaning as distinct organisational logics that guide the development of GEAs . Through the case of the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services the paper examines the organisation of expertise using an analytical framework of six organisational modes the modes of foundation incorporation representation convention exhibition and transformation . Drawing on interviews and document analysis the paper finds that the logic of authority and the logic of meaning often promote distinct organisational arrangements that are at times mutually reinforcing and at times in tension . The analysis suggests that balancing these two pursuits is not without its challenges . However it highlights the potential to recognise GEAs as experimental and evolutionary organisations for environmental governance .,Authority and meaning are logics that guide the organisation of expertise in GEAs. The organisation of expertise in IPBES is perceived through organisational modes. In IPBES authority and meaning are at times mutually reinforcing or in tension. Interactions between logics and modes can produce innovations in expertise. Deeper thinking about organisational arrangements for transformation is needed.
1424,Scholars from diverse fields of inquiry agree on the need to redesign institutions for governance of complex transboundary water systems to become more adaptive and they assume that this will lead to a desired end state . However the exact features of the desired end state are often not clearly delineated and the relationship between attributes of adaptive governance and the desired end state is difficult to empirically assess . We advocate for shifting the research focus instead to investigating the proximity of a complex water system to desired ends by assessing three aspects the nature and significance of contextual constraints operating on a policy regime the current status of policy outputs and the outcomes achieved by the system to date . Taken together these can provide us with a broader and deeper picture of what we want to achieve with adaptive governance and how close we are to achieving it . Methodologically it then becomes easier to assess the impact of changes to governance institutions in subsequent research . We demonstrate these arguments through an illustrative comparison of two complex water governance systems in North America Great Lakes Basin and Rio Grande Bravo River Basin .,This paper provides a fresh perspective on the desired end state DES for adaptive water governance proposing that the concept include three aspects the nature and significance of contextual constraints the current status of policy outputs and the outcomes achieved by the system to date. The paper provides means to clarify methodological challenges associated with studying the DES including its relationship to adaptive governance institutions and how normative conceptualizations of DES might be avoided. The possibilities for comparative analysis are demonstrated through illustrative investigation of DES in the Great Lakes and Rio Grande Bravo basins.
1425,The Land Degradation Neutrality Initiative of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification encourages each of the 123 signatory countries to stabilise or reduce their extent of degraded land . Land degradation is assessed using the methods described in the Good Practice Guidance document for Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 15.3.1 using three sub indicators land cover change land productivity and soil organic carbon stocks . The GPG identifies degraded areas by aggregating the sub indicator assessments using a one out all out approach in which an area is identified as degraded if any one or more of the sub indicators shows degradation i.e . a land cover transition defined as degradation a reduction in productivity and or a reduction in SOC stocks . Under some circumstances however the 1OAO method can result in a counterintuitive degradation assessment such as where the removal of invasive plant species reduces plant biomass which would normally suggest degradation of net primary production but which in this circumstance is considered a positive change in the context of land remediation activities . Each country has the opportunity to report areas within its sovereign bounds as an error of false positive or false negative degradation with sufficient justification however it is vital that this is done in a way that ensures consistency of reporting amongst countries at regional and global scales . This paper describes scenarios in which the 1OAO process can lead to a counterintuitive degradation assessment focusing on the potential impacts of invasive plants woody encroachment and land remediation activities on SOC stocks as examples . We present an interpretation matrix to assist with determining how to report degradation in these cases and help identify the drivers of degradation and potential remediation activities . Increased clarity around degradation labelling and interpretation could improve reporting consistency and transparency and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of land degradation remediation actions .,The degradation interpretation matrix guides decisions for UN SDG Indicator 15.3.1. Some remediation activities can cause land to be classified as degraded. Biophysical information alone is insufficient to determine land degradation state.
1426,Optimism about the contribution of city policies worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is widespread . It is based though on partial and anecdotal studies rather than comprehensive system wide estimates . Popular empirical indicators to support the importance of cities such as consumption based emissions within city borders lack a policy connection . Here I undertake an initial assessment of the effectiveness of emissions reduction through urban climate policies . It employs a novel decomposition of effectiveness into reach capability and stringency . This results in a qualitative estimation of current and maximum contributions of city climate policies divided into four types to global emissions reduction . I formalize the framework to numerically illustrate additional policy aspects . Based on the insights obtained I suggest policy and political strategies to make better use of cities competences to mitigate climate change .,Qualitative estimates of current and maximum emissions reduction by city policies. Employs novel decomposition of effectiveness into reach ability and stringency. Complements partial and anecdotal studies with comprehensive systemwide assessment. Formal conceptual approach to quantify estimates with numerical illustrations. Suggest policy and political strategies to make better use of cities competences.
1427,Strategic land use planning assumes a pivotal role in flood risk management . By using formal instruments spatial planning can legally secure areas for flood retention or other flood protection measures as well as regulate settlement development in hazard areas and ensure flood adapted land uses . The interrelations between upstream and downstream riparian areas in flood risk management however require regional or catchment oriented approaches in strategic land use planning to better coordinate land development options along rivers . This paper examines two strategic planning instruments in Austrian flood risk management . The two instruments Blauzone Rheintal in Vorarlberg and Schutzwasserwirtschaftlicher Raumentwicklungsplan in Carinthia were developed by water authorities and spatial planning departments to prevent settlement growth in flood prone areas and to secure land for flood protection schemes . Despite having similar problems in their backgrounds and objectives the implementation processes of these instruments differ significantly while the Blauzone Rheintal was formalized as a legally binding regional land use plan the SREP was not developed beyond the pilot stage . This paper identifies important contextual conditions and lessons learned to facilitate the scaling up and replication of catchment oriented spatial planning instruments in other flood prone regions .,There exist a wide pressure to build new and more buildings in floodplain. Spatial planning has seized a prominent role in reducing future losses. Governance arrangements influence the planning process. Planning is a result of the political process. Planning needs a vision oriented integrative framework
1428,Most indicators of airport performance found in the literature evaluate the quality of the services and the maintenance of operational safety levels but only a few studies take into account environmental issues . This study presents the experience of the Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Enterprise in the implementation and assessment of the Infraero Environmental Performance Index formed by 25 indicators distributed into 10 environmental dimensions . The index was applied to 54 Brazilian public airports administrated by Infraero between 2017 and 2019 . The index was also applied to groups of airports according to their category defined by the Brazilian Civil Aviation Regulation n 153 IEPI,Airport environmental performance index in Brazil had average annual evolution of 5 . Large airports presented better environmental performance values. Performance index considering biomes is a new approach relevant for decision making.
1429,The market of bottled water is projected to become the largest beverage category by volume worldwide . Consumption data are already impressive in many countries with Italy leading the path in the European Union . Such market expansion will come with environmental costs due to increasing plastics production and increasing bottle leakage in the environment . To tackle the problem consumer purchasing decision can make the difference . Using a hypothetical Discrete Choice Experiment this study explores consumer preferences and willingness to pay for plastic water bottles made of conventional plastic polymer and of more sustainable plastic alternatives . Additionally by comparing two experimental conditions the study investigates whether information on plastic related sustainability might affect consumer purchasing decisions . The results provide insights that could be relevant from a market and policy perspective . They indicate that Italian consumers prefer Bio bottles water bottles with respect to common PET being willing to pay more for these alternatives . Furthermore recycled materials are dispreferred compared to virgin plastics and information provision seems to help consumers discriminating across different plastic types although it is not effective in increasing willingness to pay .,Consumer purchasing decisions are essential for the bioplastics transition. A Discrete Choice Experiment is used to evaluate consumer preferences. Consumers positively evaluate bioplastics for food packaging. Consumers are willing to pay more for bioplastics. Recycled plastics are dispreferred with respect to virgin polymers.
1430,Soil degradation is one of the greatest threats to global civilization with claims that there may be as few as 60 years of harvests left globally . As such the concept of soil health has gained increasing interest in recent years . However despite years of research there is no universally agreed metric or metrics on which policy aimed at protecting or enhancing soil health can be based . Here we argue that the challenges associated with measuring and monitoring soil health from a policy perspective are an issue of current approach rather than concept of soil health,Soil degradation is one of the greatest threats to global civilization. The concept of soil health has gained increasing interest in recent years. Despite years of research there is no universally agreed metric on which soil health policy can be based. A Payment for Practice paradigm would circumvent the issues associated with a performance based policy paradigm
1431,Marine spatial planning a process aimed at negotiating the spatial allocation of human activities at sea has to integrate new challenges arising from growing human activities and their impacts on threatened marine ecosystems . Yet humanwildlife interactions that result in threat to humans are rarely explicitly addressed in planning and almost not at all in MSP . Rare events of unprovoked shark bites can significantly impact local economies while leading to polarized social debates that often hinder the development of evidence based shark risk public policy . Here we suggest an approach for integrating shark risk and its management into MSP . The method addresses simultaneously the spatial social and ecological components of shark risk and its inherent uncertainties . The approach is applied on Reunion Island case study where shark risk management is implemented as a response to a rapid increase in the frequency of shark bite events over the past decade . Similar to other countries where shark risk management is implemented sharks removal is in the heart of social debate in Reunion Islands and data gaps provide a fertile ground for alternative discourses and social conflicts about shark risk . Through a structured public consultation involving 200 stakeholders we demonstrate how MSP can be used to address shark risk while considering multiple sea uses and conservation objectives . The results suggest that the approach is ideal both for integrating shark risk as a driver to the MSP process and for developing a transparent sustainable and evidence based shark risk public policy as it places shark risk management within a broader social ecological spectrum of stakes .,MSP is an effective platform for addressing human shark related conflicts. MSP contributes to the development of shark risk management policies. Suggested planning approach highlights risk related data gaps.
1432,Evidence informed decision making aims to deliver effective actions informed by the best available evidence . Given the large quantity of primary literature and time constraints faced by policy makers and practitioners well conducted evidence reviews can provide a valuable resource to support decision making . However previous research suggests that some evidence reviews may not be sufficiently reliable to inform decisions in the environmental sector due to low standards of conduct and reporting . While some evidence reviews are of high reliability there is currently no way for policy makers and practitioners to quickly and easily find them among the many lower reliability ones . Alongside this lack of transparency there is little incentive or support for review authors editors and peer reviewers to improve reliability . To address these issues we introduce a new online freely available and first of its kind evidence service the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Database of Evidence Reviews CEEDER,The number of evidence reviews is increasing but their rigour and risks of bias vary. Easier access to rigorous evidence reviews may support evidence informed decision making. CEEDER collates published evidence reviews into a searchable open access database. CEEDER assesses evidence reviews for their reliability using the CEESAT appraisal tool. CEEDER will be further developed through co production with evidence user organisations.
1433,The idea of decoupling environmental bads from economic goods has been proposed as a path towards sustainability by organizations such as the OECD and UN . Scientific consensus reports on environmental impacts and resource use give an indication of the kind of decoupling needed for ecological sustainability global absolute fast enough and long enough . This goal gives grounds for a categorisation of the different kinds of decoupling with regard to their relevance . We conducted a survey of recent research on decoupling on Web of Science and reviewed the results in the research according to the categorisation . The reviewed 179 articles contain evidence of absolute impact decoupling especially between CO2 emissions and evidence on geographically limited cases of absolute decoupling of land and blue water use from GDP but not of economy wide resource decoupling neither on national nor international scales . Evidence of the needed absolute global fast enough decoupling is missing .,We reviewed 179 articles on decoupling published between 19902019. The papers present evidence of absolute impact decoupling mainly between CO2 and GDP. No evidence of economy wide national international absolute resource decoupling. No evidence of the kind of decoupling needed for ecological sustainability. In the absence of robust evidence the goal of decoupling rests partly on faith.
1434,Petrochemical industry often faces widespread public opposition in many developing countries . A growing research focuses on alleviating such opposition through improving the knowledge of the relationships between local context risk communication and petrochemical pollution risk perception . A novel methodology that integrated an expected based utility theory with risk perception mapping approach geographic information system based statistics and spatial regression technique was proposed . Using a survey of the residents surrounding two Naphtha Cracker Complexes in Taiwan at different development stages this study compares the components of residents risk perceptions surrounding these two NCCs and their connections with various risk communication practices . Results show that the distribution of risk perceptions among the residents is highly spatial autocorrelated although their determinants vary per NCC . Surrounding the NCC in operation proximity and pollution experience have a strong effect on residents risk perception while risk communication factors such as risk information understanding and social trust are more critical determinants for the one in development . The policy recommendations are that the risk communication can put great emphasis on encouraging dialogue between various stakeholders and decision makers and improve the timing of communicating risk social trust and the understanding of the concerns of residents . This helps residents enhance the knowledge of risk information and satisfaction with NCCs risk coping responses especially the NCC at development stage .,A novel methodology to test the components of risk perception is proposed. The approach links risk communication local context and risk perception. The distribution of risk perceptions is highly spatial autocorrelated. The determinants of perceived petrochemical risks vary with development stages. Risk communication can focus on encouraging the dialogue between stakeholders.
1435,Artisanal and small scale mining provides a source of livelihood for millions of mostly poor people across the globe . At the same time however the sector is predominantly informal and associated with a range of persistent social and environmental challenges including chronic poverty deforestation land degradation mercury pollution and river siltation . The ASM sector is connected to all the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in ways which both support and undermine their achievement . Attention therefore is growing on how the sector can shape and be shaped by the pursuit of the SDGs . This paper aims to articulate the linkages and interactions between ASM and the SDGs to inform ongoing debates about how to address the sectors social and environmental impacts . The review engages with three key and closely related issues that are central to determining the potential for synergies to emerge between ASM and the SDGs . These are 1 the large scale bias in mining policy 2 debates around formalisation and 3 knowledge . It is argued that the SDGs their 169 targets and 232 indicators and the state and corporate driven processes behind their development serve to exacerbate the large scale bias promote an approach to formalisation that risks marginalising the poorest and entrenching inequality and privilege techno scientific knowledge at the expense of studies which examine the governance systems that actually dictate who where how and why people engage with ASM knowledge that is essential for effective policy design . The review concludes that the prospects for the SDGs contributing positively to efforts to address environmental and social issues in ASM are poor . Worryingly similar arguments apply across a range of important sectors such as forestry and agriculture where informality and poverty are also widespread . Raising the prospects for the SDGs requires focussing less on measuring whether or not particular indicators are met but rather on understanding what such goal setting governance systems actually do with respect to the lives of their intended beneficiaries and the environments they inhabit . Such an understanding can inform strategies to resist the more pernicious effects of ostensibly unobjectionable global sustainability agendas .,Reviews linkages between the SDGs and ASM and examines prospects for synergies and antagonisms. Engages with 3 key debates the large scale policy bias formalisation knowledge politics. Corporate and state centric nature of SDGs risks entrenching large scale bias. SDGs risk promoting an approach to formalisation that entrenches poverty and inequality. A broader knowledge of ASM governance dynamics is essential to future work.
1436,This article analyzes the European regulation REACH as a co management policy tool for chemical risks . Whilst the existing literature on the topic either highlights the strong capacity of authorities to force the industry to produce the data needed for decision making or criticizes the formers subordination to economic interests this article takes a new approach showing how regulators and the industry use REACH to engage in systematic compromise and a pedagogical approach to chemical risks . Information and resource asymmetry make co management necessary for the implementation of the regulation but comes at the cost of the,Implementation of REACH does not respect the no data no market principle. Precautionary principle was replaced by co management of risks with the industry. Co management supposes systematic compromise and a pedagogic approach. Co management pragmatically responds to information and resources asymmetry. It is unclear to what extent REACH protects Europeans health.
1437,The last decade has witnessed rapid progress in energy cooperation between the countries of the BBIN sub region . Cooperation has been bilateral with each of the countries entering into separate energy development and trade agreement with India broadly similar to the water sector where national governments engage bilaterally on transboundary cooperation and dispute resolution . A more recent wave of electrical grid interconnections and hydro energy cooperation has emerged with governments increasingly shifting from bilateral to multilateral energy sharing agreements . This trend holds considerable potential for regional transboundary water governance . Based on documentary and media analysis along with interviews of key BBIN policy makers we identify and examine in this paper four factors for future progress 1 technical cooperation can be extended to information sharing for policies and institutions to regulate and manage water resources 2 India must seize the opportunities and benefits of enhanced regional leadership in the region 3 simultaneous informal discussion and diplomatic negotiation of water energy and their nexus can provide BBIN countries the opportunity to highlight potential gains of cooperation and interstate interdependencies and 4 regional cooperation can give a strong impetus to nations for advancing structural reforms building institutions and capacity developing a shared knowledge base bridging infrastructural gaps attracting private sector participation and addressing poverty alleviation goals including job creation .,There exists controversy and potential conflict over transboundary water sharing and management of rivers in South Asia. The article provides a comparative view on water and energy cooperation and discusses its implications. Water diplomacy in the region is impacted by each countrys domestic politics and diplomatic approach Indias hegemonic role and lack of functioning regional institutional frameworks. Water discourses are heavily securitized energy is perceived as a commodity of exchange. Energy diplomacy focussing on mutual benefits and shared interests offers a path for cooperation in other sectors such as water.
1438,In the face of global environmental change decision makers need effective environmental assessments to shape policies and plans aiming at sustainable human development . In this paper we propose a new approach to address the needs of Strategic Environmental Assessment . We develop a Limits Oriented Adaptive framework that is useful not only to recognize and address existing SEA problems but also to incorporate elements of social and institutional uncertainty . This framework conceptualizes the need to first identify existing SEA limitations through learning loops and then to address them with incremental or transformative change through adaptive cycles . The first part of this paper presents existing frameworks of adaptive policy making adaptive management and loops of learning that can contribute shaping better environmental assessments . In the second part we present our framework and we illustrate how the contributions from different disciplines relate to the procedural and technical sides of Strategic Environmental Assessment . Last we present the results of the experimental application of our method in an Australian and an Italian case study . We then discuss our findings outlining how SEA can learn from adaptive management to overcome its limitations and to embrace incremental and transformational change . We tie these lessons to the needs of different groups of SEA professionals developers legislators and the broad public .,SEA can learn from adaptive management to address its inherent limitations. Learning loops and adaptive cycles help detecting SEA problems and addressing them. A Limits Oriented framework suggests when to recognise and to deal with SEA issues. SEA in diversified contexts can improve adopting a Limits Oriented framework.
1439,There is rising international concern about the zoonotic origins of many global pandemics . Increasing human animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer emphasising the close relationships between human animal and environmental health . Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio ecological systems . This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans . It also undermines natural resource availability compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human to human disease transmission . Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases . Conversely measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity . We use the DPSIR framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid 19 and other zoonotic diseases and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both regulating human to human disease transfer and treatment of disease outbreaks . From this analysis we identify a set of appropriate response options recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management . Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity . The need to respond to the Covid 19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future . Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace and is also therefore transferrable to other existential global scale threats including climate change and the biodiversity crisis . This also highlights the need for concerted global action and is also consistent with the duties and ultimately the self interests of developed donor nations .,There is an increasing trend in incidence of and interest in zoonotic diseases. Pervasive ecosystem degradation reduces the ecosystem service of disease regulation. Decreasing barriers between humans and wildlife exacerbate zoonotic disease risks. Ecosystem degradation degrades natural resources vital for managing transmission. Policy responses addressing zoonotic threats should include ecosystem regeneration.
1440,This paper reviews the early history of IPBES and focuses on epistemic choices that occurred early on in its establishment and assessment work .,The paper conceptualises IPBES as a site where diverse conceptions of nature compete for relevance and authority. To establish authority and increase its immediate relevance for policy makers IPBES addressed uncertainty debates and used economic rhetoric. These epistemic choices anticipated struggle among and between IPBES member states and experts. To resolve them IPBES shifted from ecosystem services to Natures Contribution to People and thereby institutionalized its authority. Yet authority is liquid and IPBES authority may change as new uncertainties arrive as part of its assessment on transformative change.
1441,Science and knowledge are called to participate in the institutional political and behavioral changes that are necessary to address biodiversity loss . Knowledge however does not possess direct performative powers and the relationships between knowledge production and use are complex as has been documented for multiple issues and by different fields of research . This paper proposes to unpack three dimensions of decision making . By taking the field of ecosystem service assessment and valuation as its main example the paper discusses and illustrates how this unpacking can help researchers situate themselves in the diversity of decision making contexts that can exist and how this can influence the contributions they can make to try and solve biodiversity issues they are involved in . After describing some key characteristics of the rationalist vision of decision it suggests that looking at the temporal continuity of decision making processes e.g . a one time moment,The contribution of biodiversity researchers to policy making is linked to how they see decision making. The rationalist model of decision often prevails in researchers assumptions regarding the social uptake of their results. To supplement this rationalist model 3 dimensions of decision making are presented and their combination leads to 27 different contexts. Researchers contributions vary according to the type of decision making they may contribute to. Information is often used in an argumentative way which has important consequences on how researchers treat social values.
1442,The proliferation of multistakeholder initiatives is deemed to be a key vehicle for the implementation of international agreements for sustainable development . This is the case with the 4 per 1000 Soils for Food Security and Climate initiative launched in March 2015 by French Minister Stphane Le Foll whose aim is to increase soil organic carbon stocks worldwide in order to simultaneously address climate change mitigation adaptation and food security issues . This paper explores the knowledge dynamics at play and the role scientists played in the early development of the initiative . It shows that the strong involvement of soil scientists in the design of 4 PM as well as in the enrolment of other stakeholders has had a dual consequence . On the one hand it has reinforced the initiatives credibility by keeping most discussions at a mere technical level considering soil organic carbon sequestration as the main proxy for climate change mitigation adaptation and food security . On the other hand this technical approach has led the initiative to be hardly able to enrol representatives from peasant and familial agricultures who have criticized the absence of clear definitions of the type of agricultural models the 4 PM intends to promote . We show that this has had detrimental consequences on the results of the 4 PM initiative and we discuss the implications both for the framing of voluntary multistakeholder initiatives and for the engagement of scientists in such settings notably in terms of their accountability .,The role of scientists in the design of a multistakeholder partnership the 4 per 1000 initiative is analysed. The involvement of soil scientists leads to keep discussions at a technical level while the initial ambition was political. The technical focus reinforces the credibility of the initiative but leads some civil society organisations to stay outside. The case study leads to support the idea of accountability as an integral part of scientific engagement in the policy process.
1443,Water diplomacy is regarded as a means to prevent conflict and to enhance peace through the cooperative management of transboundary water resources . There have been calls for water diplomacy to be given further attention especially by foreign policy and security specialists and to be extended to non state actors through informal dialogue processes . The paper critically questions the qualitative changes water diplomacy delivers and argues for further analytical scrutiny on its efficacy . Using a critical hydropolitics perspective the paper advances understanding of the way power asymmetries presiding over contested waters are altered or maintained particularly through informal diplomacy . To exemplify the paper uses Track 2 diplomacy or an informal dialogue process between non state actors . Drawing on the case study of the Track 2 process by the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific the paper examines how foreign affairs experts deliberated water security in the Mekong river basin in the face of rapid dam development . The analysis demonstrates that information was forwarded to officials within the ministry of foreign affairs and created alternative knowledge channels differentiated from networks of water and environmental ministries . Informal diplomacy also enabled downstream states usually considered to have less influence on issues of water allocation to exercise power in agenda setting and influencing the debate . However flows of finance around dam development within the region made it difficult for informal diplomacy to provide alternatives to existing transboundary water arrangements such that it changes power relations manifested in formal diplomacy . The paper suggests attentive analysis on the links between state and non state actors through informal diplomacy and the nuanced way resources and networks are mobilised to control water resources .,Water diplomacy is multi track with informal tracks involving foreign affairs and security actors. Informal water diplomacy has a role to inform and share knowledge on shared rivers. Informal water diplomacy can extend beyond the geographical scope of the river. The efficacy of water diplomacy is related to the political economy of water
1444,What does a science of environmental conservation look like Though we often see it as a contemporary problem engineering the interface of science and decision making bodies has been a question since the founding of ecology . This study traces the creation of new conservation initiatives via the repeated splintering of the Ecological Society of America since the early 1900s and compares these against the results of a network analysis of contemporary scientists and their affiliations . Notwithstanding the new terminology of science policy interfaces brokers and gaps these questions often hinge on the same dilemmas as they did at the beginning of 20th century . The history of these groups shows how divisive distinctions between ecology and conservation pure and applied research science and politics and facts versus values can quickly become integrated into the structure of organizationseven those that are created specifically to bridge gaps in what today would be called the science policy interface . Meanwhile a social network analysis of present day scientists suggests that individual researchers are finding ways to informally jump across science policy gaps at a sub organizational level . Remarkably these science policy conflicts can pose major problems for organizations even when the actual activities of members traverse these boundaries on an individual basis . When designing science policy interfaces formal bridging mechanisms between organizations remain important but these should also support the ongoing if under the radar ways that individuals negotiate gaps between conservation research and policy advocacy .,Conservation sciences role in policy advocacy has been debated for over a century. Science organizations have splintered repeatedly over questions of policy engagement. Not knowing this history ensures organizations are doomed to repeat it. Network analysis suggests scientists collaborate with NGOs more than they realize. Science policy interfaces should facilitate existing collaboration when possible.
1445,Aquaculture including marine aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector globally and is expected to play a key role in delivering future food security . A potential factor limiting growth of the aquaculture industry however is the maintenance of good water quality on which all forms of aquaculture depend . This is particularly challenging in open coastal and estuarine systems and requires engagement with a wide range of stakeholders that can influence water quality . We applied a semi quantitative method to capture and evaluate perspectives across diverse stakeholders in order to address the overarching question How do stakeholders rank water quality issues and management options versus other issues and actions for ensuring the sustainability of shellfish mariculture in South West England Results from this regional case study were used to highlight key issues and knowledge gaps that have national and international relevance . Stakeholders were found to hold distinct perspectives but there was general consensus that good water quality is essential for sustainable aquaculture and that there is a need for better understanding of spatial and temporal variations in land use throughout catchments to ensure effective water quality management . Stakeholder engagement highlighted the importance of managing anthropogenic and environmental pressures on land and water through agri environment and urban planning policy in order to ensure sustainable food production including from mariculture .,Diverse stakeholders agree that water quality management is key to sustainable mariculture. Stakeholders were found to hold one of three distinct perspectives P1 P3 . P1 Downstream thinking focusing on managing sewer overflows affecting microbial quality. P2 Broad view of upstream and downstream pressures on microbial and chemical quality. P3 Upstream thinking for controlling diffuse and point source pollution from agricultural land.
1446,Agricultural intensification continues to threaten habitat and biological diversity in farmland . In Europe the Common Agricultural Policy has established several measures to support biodiversity fostering elements such as landscape features semi natural habitats and extensive land uses together referred to as Green and Blue Infrastructure . However CAP measures effectiveness to support GBI has not been accurately evaluated yet . We assess GBI occurrence across a variety of European agricultural systems covering a gradient of farming intensity and analyse to what extent the CAP is supporting their presence by enhancing farmer s awareness and the uptake of measures that foster GBI . We carried out habitat surveys in 115 Landscape Test Squares of 500m 500m in six case study areas including arable land pastures and mixed farming systems in Spain Germany and Bulgaria . We mapped GBI including small landscape elements in field elements and connectivity features . We used historical imagery to map changes on GBI occurrence in LTS from 2012 to 2018 . We also used questionnaires with farmers and stakeholders on their GBI awareness and compared their answers to elements mapped . Results showed that landscape and in field GBI occurrence was higher in extensive than in intensive farming systems regardless of the region whereas the opposite was found for connectivity features . The analysis of habitat changes showed a small increase of certain biodiversity fostering in field GBI but no substantial change in connectivity features or landscape elements . Moreover a significant reduction of valuable GBI like grasslands was observed . There were several mismatches between the patterns of GBI identified by farmers and stakeholders and their mapped abundances . Our results indicate that the CAP has not substantially increased the availability of biodiversity fostering GBI in these regions and that adopted features were mostly related to neutral or negative effects on biodiversity . Farmers perception of GBI features seems driven by production management decisions rather than by biodiversity concerns .,Green and Blue Infrastructure GBI occurrence and change over time is quantified. We cover different farming systems in Southwest Central and Southeast Europe. CAP is not actively encouraging the establishment of new biodiversity fostering GBI. GBI most valuable for biodiversity like grasslands have significantly decreased. Farmers perception of GBI seems driven by production management decisions.
1447,We compare how Finland and the Netherlands organize home care services both in legislation and in procurement practices from a service triad risk perspective . We find Finnish public bodies rely to a great extent on inhouse provision and hybrid outsourcing . Dutch public bodies rely completely on outsourcing using framework agreements with many care providers in parallel . Incentives used in contracts affect financial and service quality risks assumed by buyers suppliers and end customers in the triad . This research improves our understanding of risk allocation among the actors in the service triad based on buyer decisions on outsourcing and supply market conditions . The risk profiles for all three actors in the home care service triad are affected by the manner in which public bodies outsource home care services the purchasing practices . The delivery method and the number of providers impact the information position of the municipality versus the care provider in the triad .,Finnish and Dutch municipalities are responsible for the coordination of home care a service triad with a public buyer. Public buyers face different risks in service triads compared to private organizations. Outsourcing arrangements and purchasing practices affect the risk allocation among the three actors in the service triad. Hybrid inhouse outsourced service provision and parallel sourcing reduce quality and financial risks emerging in service triads. Contract incentives determine how financial and quality risks are allocated among the three actors in the service triad.
1448,Due to the current shift towards solution provision in many industrial markets buyers are under increasing pressure to develop sourcing strategies to procure custom solutions for their firm in order to achieve competitive advantage . The question arises as to how buyers can ensure they get the best solutions from their suppliers and whether social capital can be applied to improve solution provision processes and value creation . Existing empirical research however has paid only little attention to the antecedents of suppliers solution provision performance i.e . their capability to diagnose buyer needs and to design and implement solutions to meet them . We tested how social capital dimensions relate to solution provision . The study uses empirical data obtained from a survey of 475 suppliers representing both manufacturing and service industries . Partial least squares structural equation modeling and polynomial regression were used to analyze the data . The results demonstrate that the availability of social capital in a buyer supplier relationship is a relevant antecedent to successful solution provision activities . However the different dimensions of social capital are found to compensate for each other to some extent . Our study further demonstrates that solution provision is not a monolithic activity but can better be understood as a multi phase process . Different aspects of social capital may have a different impact depending on the phase of solution provision . The successful diagnosis of buyer needs mediates the effect of social capital on solution design and implementation . It is also found that production characteristics of a buyer and the type of a supplier solution affect the role of social capital in solution provision process .,This study tests how social capital supports solution provision by a supplier. PLS SEM and polynomial regression are applied in the analysis of survey data. Social capital improves solution provision in buyer supplier relationships. Social capital dimensions have varying effects on the activities in solution provision. Social capital is most beneficial for the diagnosis of customer needs.
1449,The capability to develop and sustain superior knowledge of markets and supply chains or supply market intelligence is an important element in increasing the strategic relevance of purchasing and supply management . This study draws on information processing theory to shed light on how firms acquire SMI . In particular the study aims to identify the drivers and mechanisms of information processing in SMI acquisition and to explore how the two constructs are related . Our findings emerged from an abductive multiple case study including 22 SMI tasks in eight case companies operating in various manufacturing industries . We find that the drivers of information processing needs in SMI acquisition are related either to uncertainty or equivocality . Uncertainty describes a situation in which decision makers may be ignorant of a variable s value while equivocality describes a situation in which they may be ignorant of the variable s existence . We identify four structural mechanisms and three information technology mechanisms for information processing in the SMI context . We also find that equivocality seems to trump uncertainty in determining the use of the identified SMI acquisition mechanisms . In addition to elaborating IPT in the,We explore how firms acquire supply market intelligence SMI . We find the drivers of information processing needs to be uncertainty or equivocality related. We identify four structural mechanisms and three information technology mechanisms. We also find equivocality to trump uncertainty in the use of SMI acquisition mechanisms.
1450,The relationship between an agent and a principal can be studied by using agency theory as a theoretical background . In this study perceptions of conflict information asymmetry and risk were examined in relation to perceptions of internal outcomes of supply managements involvement in services contracting in an intra organizational dyadic context . Structural equation modeling and regression analysis were used to analyze the nature of the relationships . The contribution is integrating a structured view of internal outcomes with three concepts from agency theory to help build a more comprehensive theory of intra organizational relationships in the context of services contracting .,Linkage between agency theory concepts and meaningful involvement.

1452,Heat stress of broilers in commercial broiler houses decreases their productivity and thus farm profitability . Climate control systems use sensors measuring the temperature around the broilers which can be different from the actual body temperature of the broilers . In this research a method estimating the body temperature of an individual broiler was designed and validated for commercial broiler houses . The method is based on a low cost IR camera calibrated in real time . The algorithm for the IR image processing uses lasso regression prediction model . A prototype using this method was built and tested in a research broiler house over 21 days for 15 broilers . The predicted body temperature was compared with the actual body temperature measured by temperature loggers implanted in the abdominal cavity . The accuracy was 0.27C measuring one broiler every 16min on average . In an experiment in a commercial broiler house a discrepancy between the climate control activation and broiler estimated body temperature was shown .,A fully automatic system for broiler body temperature measuring was developed. The body temperature is estimated with accuracy 0.27C. The low cost thermal camera based system has commercial potential. Broiler house climate control should be based on temperature of broilers.
1453,The sequence pattern mining method aims to identify frequent sequences that exceed a user specified support threshold . The present study uses the same approach based on sequential standards to estimate the heat stress of broilers from a resulting behavioural pattern . Experimental data were recorded in a climate chamber where the behaviour of broilers was recorded under thermoneutral conditions set as standard and when exposed to thermal stress . The Generalised Sequential Patterns algorithm was used to evaluate the heat stress of broilers in the third and fourth week of growth . The results indicated that the mining of pattern sequences is a useful and straightforward technique to estimate the welfare of broiler chickens allowing the identification of temporal relations between thermal stress and the consequent behaviour of the broiler . Temperature 8C below the standard thermoneutral conditions showed that the broiler remained lying down most of the time walking only to the drinker and feeder trough . Broilers exposed to temperatures 8C above the standard thermoneutral conditions tend to decrease locomotor activities showing lower welfare status .,GSP is a promising tool to detect a behavioural pattern in broiler rearing. A series of behaviours related to thermal stress in broiler rearing was detected. The GSP approach can be used to detect animal behaviour under stress. Heat stress might induce a different behavioural pattern in broiler production.
1454,Currently the temperature humidity index is a common method of evaluating the risk of heat stress in cows by employing climatic parameters . However the THI is a general and indirect indicator that fails to consider individual cows . Various studies have used animal related parameters to account for the heat load of individual cows . This review provides an overview of different heat stress indicators that have been used in the past 10 years with a focus on animal related and non invasive indicators . These indicators are reviewed with regard to their potential for quantifying individual heat loads in ongoing and future studies of dairy cows . The review is divided into sections covering physiological behavioural and performance indicators . Parameters that appear to be suitable for assessing the individual stress loads of dairy cows include respiration rate and body temperature whereas losses in milk yield are more a consequence of heat stress than an indicator . Using activity and feeding behaviour as an indicator of heat stress may depend on the cows physiological state . However no thresholds for animal related indicators employed as signs of heat load can be found in the literature . In contrast thresholds for THI levels are described above which changes in cows physiology and behaviour are detectable under heat stress . In conclusion the development and use of non invasive sensors should focus on physiological indicators and further studies are needed to determine the thresholds for these indicators .,Heat stress affects the welfare and performance of dairy cows. Animal related parameters should be used to detect individual heat load of cows. Individual heat load can be studied via respiration rate and body temperature. The development of non invasive methods to detect heat load in cattle is promising.

In this study computational fluid dynamics an artificial neural network and a multi objective genetic algorithm were used to investigate the hydraulic performance of an MPCE and conduct parameter optimisation . A CFD software package was used to analyse the influence of the working parameters structural parameters and material properties on the flow characteristics of MPCE . Subsequently an ANN and MOGA were used to optimise fabrication cost flow rate and flow index of the emitter . The results showed that a decrease in the bottom thickness or wall thickness of the MPCE increased the flow index of the emitter and the sensitivity of the flowrate to changes in pressure . Low working pressure was conducive to maintaining the active irrigation characteristic of the MPCE but the flowrate decreased . For crops with low water requirement these conditions are ideal . The flow in the MPCE microchannel was mainly affected by the viscous resistance whereas the inertial resistance only had an effect when the flow velocity was large .

However there are no recommendations or limitations on the storage time for the standard Triangle odour bag method used in China . In order to optimise the selection of sampling bags selected types of sampling bags were tested and compared by using selected key odorants .

1477,The interface behaviour between the steel surfaces of a silo and the grains wheat stored within plays a decisive role in the design of the structure of the silo . A series of strain controlled direct shear tests including monotonic loading cyclic loading and post cyclic loading were used to study the behaviour of the wheat steel interface behaviour . The influence of cycle numbers shear displacement amplitude normal stress and initial void ratio on the behaviour of the interface behaviour are examined in detail . It was observed that the cyclic loading results in an increasing peak strength internal friction angle and apparent cohesion whereas decreasing interface contraction deformation occurs . The results show that the values of peak stress increase with increasing displacement amplitude and cycles and they change slightly after 10 cycles . The interface exhibits overall contraction while the contraction is suppressed by an alternating small dilation during cyclic loading . The ultimate peak shear strength increases with increasing normal stress and decreasing initial void ratio . During the tests the interfaces displayed larger contraction at higher normal stresses and initial void ratios .

1481,A subsoiler is an important implement in no tillage agriculture that can keep the soil in a good condition and increase crop yields . The prediction and reduction of the draught force of subsoilers are vital for improving the efficiency of subsoilers and saving energy . In this paper a mathematical analytical model considering the subsoiler geometry soil properties and working conditions was developed for predicting the draught force of a curved subsoiler . In addition three curved subsoilers that were adapted for three different working depths were designed according to the model to reduce the draught force and energy consumption . Field experiments were conducted to validate the model and compare the draught force soil disturbance area and specific resistance of the designed subsoilers with conventional ones . The results showed that the correlations between the measured and predicted draught force soil disturbance area and specific resistance were significant which meant that the model could be used to predict the performance of a curved subsoiler . The three designed subsoilers had smaller draught forces and specific resistances than those of conventional subsoilers at their designed working depths so the designed subsoilers exhibited better performance at their designed working depths than conventional subsoilers . Therefore the model developed in this paper was useful for predicting the draught force of curved subsoilers and designing a subsoiler with low specific resistance .,It is efficient to design subsoilers according to required tillage depths. A model can be used to design curved subsoilers with low specific resistance. Subsoilers exhibit better performance at their designed working depths.
1482,Reasonable capacity planning is important to improve the efficiency of agricultural operations and reduce the operating cost for maintenance service providers during the harvesting season . Many studies involve staffing and scheduling approaches that account for nonstationary demand . However these methods are not applicable in the field of agricultural operations because of the explosive growth of the failure rate during the harvesting season . In addition few studies have involved allocation methods and related models between different planning levels especially for the uncertain demand in agricultural machinery maintenance service which has a strong reliance on results between the different management levels . Motivated by this observed gap this paper proposes a two stage analytical methodology that connects the data between different planning levels and aims to develop a dynamic capacity planning method of maintenance service for agricultural machinery fleets . At the first stage we develop a scheduling model for agricultural machinery fleets based on the time window of harvesting . At the second stage we propose a following service mode and a dynamic covering model based on the scheduling results in which queuing theory is used to solve the service parameters . This study satisfies the needs of service providers to find the optimum balance between high service quality and reasonable costs . A real life case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as well as the effectiveness of the designed approach .,Breaking down the data barriers at different management levels.

1483,The presence of illegal additives in wheat flour is an important and broadly recognised global issue of food quality and safety . Hyperspectral imaging combines the advantages of spectroscopy and imaging techniques and is widely used for food quality and safety evaluation . In this study near infrared hyperspectral imaging was used to discriminate low levels of talcum powder and benzoyl peroxide particles in wheat flour . After data pre processing spectra of wheat talcum powder mixture samples were analysed by first derivative band difference and the spectra of wheat BPO mixture samples were analysed by spectral correlation measurement method and band ratio method . Successful results were obtained for discriminating single adulterants from wheat talcum powder BPO mixtures as well as both adulterants synchronously from wheat talcum powder BPO mixtures . All these results show that NIR hyperspectral imaging technique combined with different spectral analysis methods can effectively discriminate the adulteration of talcum powder and BPO particles in wheat flour .,NIR hyperspectral imaging proved effective for adulterant discrimination. Talcum and BPO can be separately synchronously discriminated in wheat flour. Spatial location of adulterants in wheat flour can be visualised in binary images. Particle size of adulterants affects the discrimination results.
1484,Seven image based methods to determine mixing uniformity in inline mixers by image processing were compared using viscous pesticides mixtures with gradually increasing uniformity . After obtaining initial optimal methods and calculation parameters they were further evaluated by a jet mixer and a layered mixer . Results showed that quantitative descriptions for uniformity inside the tube by grey level co occurrence matrix and concentration difference within time sequence failed to reflect accurately the changing trends in uniformity . A histogram information entropy based method tended to underestimate changes while coefficient of variance based on each single frame which calculated differences in pixel values underestimated it when mixtures showed stratification indicating that both methods were not suitable . However the accuracy of methods using explicit features such as second order moments of grey scale histogram and optimised area weighted uniformity index as well as implicit methods such as principal components analysis were suitable and the normalised index 80 can be suitable because no non scattered pesticide remained . Single viewing images were adequate for evaluating the uniformity produced by mixers although small errors between horizontal and vertical viewing images existed . During evaluations by mixers OAU and PCA proved to be more advantageous than HSM because these methods do not only rely on pixel probability distributions of grey scale histograms but the positional information of the pesticide distribution even though the HSM is more time efficient than them .,Evaluation of methods to analyse pesticides uniformity in direct nozzle injection systems. Seven image based methods examined to evaluate mixing efficacy. Image based methods were justified by both CFD simulations and experiments. PCA HSM OAU methods reflected changing trends in uniformity in verification tests. PCA OAU perform better than HSM in determining uniformity for mixers.

Both soil inversion and pulverization increased with increase in velocity ratio. Optimum velocity ratio exists for an active passive combination tillage implement.
1488,A mechanistic model for ammonia removal in a countercurrent biological air scrubber was set up . This model was used to study the effect of the influent characteristics air temperature ventilation rate and ammonia load on ammonia removal efficiency . Besides mass balances of the components participating in the biological conversions the water mass balance and the heat balance were considered . The effects of the pH and the concentration of the nitrogen components on the driving force for mass transfer were examined . The model output was compared against experimental data from a pig housing facility . Simulations were performed to assess the usefulness of pH control and to investigate the effect of inflow air conditions on the ammonia removal efficiency . The study found out that although pH control affected the nitrogen component distribution in the washing water it hardly affected the ammonia removal efficiency . Thus pH control for biological air scrubbers is not recommended in practice however an on off pH control system adding only acid at critical moments could be considered . The variations in the ammonia removal efficiency are mainly caused by a changing ventilation rate rather than air temperature fluctuations or ammonia load .,A mechanistic model for a biotrickling filter for ammonia removal was developed. pH control affected the nitrogen component distribution in the washing water. Changing ventilation rate mainly caused variations in ammonia removal efficiency. Simulation results agreed with experimental data from a pig housing facility.

The most resistant blend was dosed with paper pulp wheat straw and gypsum. The frame was quite compact and showed a suitable punching and traction resistance. The barrier effect of the hydromulches reduced seedling emergence.

1492,Pressure gradients can not be avoided in jet fish pumps due to their contracting and expanding sections . Pressure gradients are an important source of fish injuries particularly for damage to fish scales . The distribution of pressure on the surface of a fish passing through a jet fish pump was studied experimentally and also by numerical simulation . A theoretical model of the forces on fish scales caused by pressure gradient was established . The results showed that the pressure on the surface a fish firstly decreases and then increases as fish passes through a jet pump . Surface pressures reach a minimum when the fish is in the throat . Pressure gradient is also a key factor for damaging fish scales . Axial pressure gradients were greater at the inlet and outlet of the throat than in other parts of the pump and radial pressure gradients increased with radial position . Also the greater the flow rate the higher both axial and radial pressure gradients produced . Radial position is therefore an important factor for both pressure gradients and determining the force on fish scales . The forces caused by pressure gradients on scales increase with radial distance and with flow rate ratio . Thus this study specifies the effects of pressure gradients on fish scales in a jet fish pump and discusses the relative influencing factors . These results could provide a basis for improved jet fish pump designs .,A theoretical model is established to describe the mechanical effects of pressure gradients on fish scales. The distribution characteristics of pressure gradients are obtained in a jet fish pump. The law of pressure variation on the surface of fish is discovered when fish cross a jet fish pump.

Four geometrically different obstructions were investigated . The flow field of water around each obstruction was visualised with the use of 2D particle image velocimetry to identify the different flow features . In parallel the acoustic emission signals were acquired by locating a piezoelectric sensor on the outer wall of the pipe at the tip of the obstruction . The acoustic emission signals were then pre processed and the frequency domain was extracted for 100 recordings in each case . Signals were processed further by using principle component analysis and a matrix is created for supervised machine learning algorithms . This methodology was applied over a range of four flow rates all in fully developed turbulent flow . Results showed that different obstructions generated different acoustic signals and flow fields which reflected the different flow fields observed with PIV . The average velocity and amplitude of the acoustic signals increased in magnitude with increasing flow rate . The machine learning algorithm with highest prediction values was quadratic support vector machine with predictions in the area of 95 accuracy or above .

Shelled corn was used in this study . This work encompasses the first part where the distribution of broken corn and foreign material was investigated in a small scale silo filled from a central filling point .

Chopping is a prerequisite for either use and reducing the shearing force has been considered as one of the most effective approaches to save energy . A smaller force can also permit more compact mechanical parts of the chopping device . In several cases power consumption may be large even when the shearing force is small if the corresponding cutting velocity is high . Consequently it is important to minimise both cutting force and power consumption simultaneously .

1506,Tractor overturning is a leading cause of fatalities for farmers . In Japan small tractors are used for farming on harsh terrain such as slippery fields and steep passage slopes . On such potentially dangerous terrain steering instability induced by bouncing and sliding can cause tractor overturning accidents . Steering instability can also deteriorate the precision of trajectory tracking in autonomous driving tractors . The present study numerically investigated tractor steering instability due to bouncing and sliding . A bouncing model and bicycle model were coupled based on Coulomb s classical theory of friction and numerical experiments were conducted using the developed model . In the simulations the tractor s travel velocity the static friction coefficient the bump length and the turning radius were considered as control parameters . A turning test was conducted to investigate the basic steering performance of the developed model . The numerical results revealed that the bouncing and sliding caused by the disturbance exciter reduced the cornering force to zero which led to a deviation of the turning trajectory from the desired trajectory . The tractor was then operated on a steep passage slope similar to those reported in accidents in Japan . In the simulation bouncing and sliding occurred because of the steep slope . The results obtained in this study strongly suggest that bouncing and sliding occurring on specific terrain result in steering instability and are a major cause of overturning accidents .,A dynamic tractor model coupling a bouncing model and bicycle model was developed. Steering instability induced by bouncing and sliding was investigated. Intensive numerical experiments were conducted for various parameter combinations. Bouncing and sliding reduced steering stability in numerical experiments.
1507,Sand media filtration is frequently used in drip irrigation systems . Commercial filter designs may use different underdrain models but wand type designs provide a large ratio of horizontal area covered by underdrains and are expected to provide a uniform flow of water through the medium . The complexity of these designs makes it difficult to analyse the effects of changing the position of wand and the slot open area . These underdrain effects were studied by means of a computational fluid dynamics model assuming clean water conditions . The backwashing process was not considered . The CFD results were validated using experimental data from a commercial sand media filter with 10 wands . Unbalanced flows between underdrains were observed in the original configuration . Two new designs were proposed a design that uses the same type of wands as the original filter but distributes them so as to have an equal horizontal area served by each wand a design that uses the same spatial distribution as the original filter but with longer wands in those regions of the original filter with lower volumetric flow . CFD simulations indicate that design can reduce the pressure drop through the filter at nominal volumetric flow rates by up to 5.8 with a more uniform flow inside the medium and design could improve the performance of the filter by achieving an up to a 4.9 reduction of pressure drop . Thus the spatial distribution of underdrains is a key parameter in the hydraulic performance of sand media filters .,Hydraulic performance of wand underdrain for sand media filter was assessed. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed and experimentally validated. Volumetric flow is higher in upper slots than in bottom ones. Volumetric flow was imbalanced between wands. With equal surface area per wand more uniform flow is achieved.

The main goal of this study was to detect blueberries internal bruising accurately after mechanical damage from hyperspectral transmittance images using the deep learning based method of fully convolutional networks for segmentation tasks . To improve detection accuracy a total of three classes were treated as segmentation targets . A near infrared hyperspectral imaging system was used to acquire transmittance images of 1200 blueberries and the images were divided randomly to form training validation and testing sets . Three categories of input HSTIs were used to evaluate the FCN models using pre trained weights and random initialisation . Random forests and linear discriminant analysis were applied to generate 9 channel and 3 channel input images along with full wavelength multi channel images . The results indicate that when using the deep learning approach blueberry bruises and calyx ends can be segmented from the blueberry fruit as early as 30min after mechanical damage has been inflicted on the blueberries . The new full wavelength model with random initialisation had the highest accuracy and can be used to research the resistance of blueberry fruit to mechanical damage . The new 3 channel and 9 channel models show potential for application to packing line detection and online inspection .,Fully convolutional networks were used for hyperspectral image segmentation. 3 channel and multi channel hyperspectral images were fed into the networks. Models trained without transfer learning outperformed those with transfer learning. The FCN models can predict early bruises accurately.
1510,The objective was to evaluate effects of structural design particle size and filter media height on pressure loss and surface velocity in the expanding filter layer during the backwashing process . The hydraulic behaviour of three commercial sand filter designs were compared . Experiments were conducted in an experimental closed circuit module . The treatments were based on the evaluation of three sand particle sizes combined with three filter bed heights for each filter design . The results showed that for the evaluated sand filters with their different drainage structures in terms of area and arrangements had different hydraulic behaviours during the backwashing . Coarser sand particles and greater filter layer heights produced larger slopes in the surface velocity curves as a function of percentage of filter bed expansion . No difference was observed in the minimum fluidisation velocity with changing the filter media heights but an increase in the minimum fluidisation velocity was observed with increasing sand particle size .

1511,The load carrying capacity of a typical greenhouse film used as covering for a Gothic type greenhouse was investigated under negative wind pressure . The film was simulated as a membrane through appropriate shell elements and analysed with the finite element method . The design wind pressures were calculated based on the provisions of Eurocode 1 and EN13031 . The FEM model boundary conditions corresponded to the real film supporting conditions of an industrial type greenhouse structure . The film was pre tensioned at its initial state in the longitudinal direction and then subjected to uniform negative wind pressure . The nonlinear elastic analysis with large deformations results showed that as the wind pressure increases the principal tensile stress in the film increases and gradually reaches the material stress at yield value . Plastic deformation is expected to take place and the film loses its capacity to return to its initial undeformed state . Consequently the plastically deformed film loses its prestress state and its proper elastic behaviour . Depending on the final wind pressure intensity and the degradation condition of the film premature failure may therefore occur . The analysis revealed that the film failure is due to insufficient supporting of the film on the steel structure . This behaviour was verified by examining a real greenhouse film failure case . Various supporting systems of the greenhouse covering films with additional intermediate supports were analysed and optimal design solutions are proposed . The proposed optimised supporting systems of greenhouse films covers a gap in the current European standard for greenhouse design .,Analysis of load carrying capacity of greenhouse covering films under wind action. Premature failure of greenhouse films is due to insufficient supporting systems. Numerical analysis results are verified by a real gothic type greenhouse case study. Methodology proposed for optimised design of supporting systems of greenhouse films. The proposed methodology covers a gap in European standard for greenhouse design.

1526,Greenhouses shelter the crop from unfavourable environmental conditions and the covering largely contributes to creating beneficial growing conditions inside . There is no perfect greenhouse cover for all combinations of crop and climatic regions . Usually a greenhouse cover has permanent optical properties determining the amount of solar radiation entering the greenhouse . Consequently during crop growth the amount and quality of the solar radiation is not ideal for the crop . Growers try to compensate for this by using different additional techniques such as temporary coatings screens and heating or cooling . New materials are currently being developed whose optical properties can be instantaneously changed . This will allow growers to gain real time control on the quantity and quality of the light entering the greenhouse to match crop requirement . The present study uses advanced simulation models to predict the potential of covers with switchable properties to improve tomato yield and use of resources in different climatic regions and with different greenhouse types . Results indicate that covers with switchable properties have advantages over permanent properties for most combinations of filter type location . Only in very extreme tropical climates will covering materials with permanent filter properties have advantages . Furthermore simulations models can play a major role in optimising the switchable filter design .,No single type of greenhouse cover has optimum performance in every climate location. Switching radiometric properties looks promising for high light demand crops. Switchable materials have no advantage over permanent filters in tropical climates. Simulation could be a powerful tool to determine optimum radiometric properties. Simulation should include specific combination of crop greenhouse location type.

Quantitative expression of foliage density and spatial distribution would contribute to improving pesticide spraying effect . Stratification porosity was proposed to describe density and spatial distribution of cotton foliage in this paper and an estimation model of stratification porosity for cotton canopy based on morphological characteristics was put forward .

1533,The current commercial technologies for mass harvesting fruit are based on the application of forced vibration to the tree which is transmitted to the fruits causing their detachment . The dynamic behaviour of the plant under forced vibration is of special interest to improve the design and use of the machinery . The objective of this work is to determine the effect of fruit and leaves on the dynamic response of the citrus branch . In this study 22 secondary branches of Valencia sweet orange trees were tested by applying forced vibration and measuring the response of the branches with triaxial accelerometers . The branches were tested in three stages in fruit branch out of fruit branch and out of leaf branch . Three natural frequency values were identified in the branches and were established as 2 7 and 11Hz . Acceleration transmissibility along the branch decreased as vibration frequency increased . The acceleration transmission values were highest for the first natural frequency and were up to 1.3 fold greater in the out of fruit branch and up to 4.6 fold greater in the out of leaf branch . The presence of fruits on the branch did not modify the branch natural frequency values but did slightly reduce the values of acceleration transmissibility . However the presence of leaves on the branches had a double effect reducing the first natural frequency and drastically damping acceleration transmissibility .,Tested citrus branches showed a similar frequency response to each other. Three natural frequencies at 2 7 and 11Hz were identified in branch response. Removal of fruit and leaves amplified vibration 1.3 and 4.6 fold respectively.

1535,Soil surface and furrow profiles in soil dynamics research and applications are usually measured using manual profile meters and laser based scanners . Manual profile meters are laborious to use and laser based scanners could be expensive and not portable . An approach was developed for measuring soil surface and furrow profiles using a portable and affordable 3D scanner . The developed approach was validated by using the 3D scanner to measure the width and depth of a V groove created in three types of soils at different soil water contents moulded in a soil box . Average error of 1.83 was found for all the three soil types and soil water contents .

In terms of percentage difference in readings the 3D scanner results showed 16 5 and 4 greater furrow width ridge height and cross sectional area respectively and 1 less furrow backfill . These differences were partly due to profile meter pins digging into loose soil and limitation with accurate width measurement . Data acquisition and processing with the 3D scanner unit were significantly faster than with the pinned profile meter . In general it could be concluded that the developed methodology has the level of accuracy required for soil surface and furrow profile measurements . Furthermore this approach is a cost effective alternative to using laser based scanners .,An approach using a 3D scanner unit to acquire soil surface profile was developed. Average error in width and depth measurements with the 3D scanner unit was 1.83 . The scanner s height above soil surface did not affect the accuracy of results.

The applied compaction pressures produced mass compaction percentages of the paddy rice ranging from 2 to 3 for 50kPa 7 to 8 for 130kPa and 10 to 12 for 210kPa . The three models applied to analyse the compacted grain mass showed good fit to the experimental data with high coefficients of determination,Higher pressure drop occurs in short long and long thin rice grains respectively. Pressure drop increases with higher compaction percentual. Projection accuracy of predictive models suffers interference during compaction. Ergun s is the best model for estimating rice pressure drop in compaction. Ergun s model shows pressure drop equal to or greater than experimental points.

1571,A novel technique for enabling robotic weed control in a commercial processing tomato field having densely populated weeds is described . It is necessary to accurately locate the stem emerging points of crop plants for the successful application of a mechanical weeding actuator to remove weeds during automated weeding . However it is a difficult and challenging task to locate the SEPs in complex natural scenarios such as when the main stem is occluded by weeds or crop foliage the crop plants are lying on the soil surface there are non uniform planting bed conditions or there is leaf damage due to insects etc . To overcome these challenges a novel crop signalling concept has been proposed to mark the crop plants at planting to make them machine readable . Plants lacking this crop signal were classified as weeds and removed by the robotic weed knife actuator . A machine vision algorithm was developed to analyse the seven views of the crop plants taken by camera with help of a specially designed imaging chamber and locate the SEPs of tomato plants which was passed to the robotic weed knife control algorithm to remove weeds .

1572,Accurate positioning of fruit is a key issue that has attracted much attention in the field of harvest robots . The complex environment and close proximity make the perception of dense crops in greenhouses a challenging problem . Different from various solutions proposed involving special equipment or other auxiliary information we propose a novel positioning approach based on instance segmentation using a monocular RGB camera . To achieve high position accuracy we first design a deep convolutional neural network in a multi task framework to export a binary segmentation map and an embedded feature map . To solve the problem of performance degradation in the intersection over union for the binary segmentation task caused by multi task optimisation the encoder part of our network is redesigned on the basis of a Visual Geometry Group network with 16 convolutional layers . Then mean shift clustering is used to achieve instance segmentation . Finally a contour finding algorithm is presented for outlining fruit without the help of any contextual information . Based on these contours the five fruits with the largest contour areas are selected as the targets for positioning . We verify our method on a public sweet pepper dataset and achieve competitive results . Divided by the radius of the fruit the average position error for the first target in the harvesting order is 0.18 which shows that our method outperforms the semantic segmentation method . For the first five targets in the harvesting order this index is less than 0.3 on average similar to that of the semantic segmentation method with only one target output .,An approach is presented to detect and locate sweet peppers in monocular RGB images. The segmentation approach for positioning does not require context information. Multiple harvesting targets are assessed simultaneously in an image.

1583,One of the options for increasing the versatility of tractors is to use them as a part of a modular traction device . The model MTD 100 consists of a power generator module and a technical module . The power generator module is a tractor with a nominal traction force of 1416kN . The technical module is an additional axle with wheels driven by the power generator module ground speed power take off . For agricultural implements whose traction resistance does not exceed 16kN only the tractor is used . When the technical module is attached to it the traction force of the entire MTD 100 increases . The MTD 100 makes it possible to tow implements with a traction resistance of up to 30kN . Since the rear wheels of the power generator module are connected by a locked drive to the wheels of the technical module there is a kinematic discrepancy,Kinematic discrepancy among the MTD 100 traction modular device driving wheels. Tyres inflation pressure influences the lead among traction device drive wheels. Tyres inflation pressure increase produces a lowering lead among the driving wheels. Ballast requires tyres inflation pressure increase to keep the same lead coefficient. Kinematic mismatch coefficient is less affected by the tyres width.

The pixels in each image of the dataset were divided into five groups of clod size based on the equivalent diameter of each clod . These image pixels were labeled for training the network and extracting the required features . Finally different soil clods were segmented and classified . A classical watershed segmentation was applied and the deep model was also trained in binary setting to evaluate the performance of the deep model and the results of the binary segmentations were compared .

1600,Automated vision based early warning systems have been developed to detect behavioural changes in groups of pigs to monitor their health and welfare status . In commercial settings automatic recording of feeding behaviour remains a challenge due to problems of variation in illumination occlusions and similar appearance of different pigs . Additionally such systems which rely on pig tracking often overestimate the actual time spent feeding due to the inability to identify and or exclude non nutritive visits to the feeding area . To tackle these problems we have developed a robust deep learning based feeding detection method that does not rely on pig tracking and is capable of distinguishing between feeding and NNV for a group of pigs . We first validated our method using video footage from a commercial pig farm under a variety of settings . We demonstrate the ability of this automated method to identify feeding and NNV behaviour with high accuracy . We then tested the method s ability to detect changes in feeding and NNV behaviours during a planned period of food restriction . We found that the method was able to automatically quantify the expected changes in both feeding and NNV behaviours . Our method is capable of monitoring robustly and accurately the feeding behaviour of groups of commercially housed pigs without the need for additional sensors or individual marking . This has great potential for application in the early detection of health and welfare challenges of commercial pigs .,An automated detection method of pig feeding and foraging behaviour was developed. The automated method is based on convolutional deep neural networks. The automated method does not rely on pig tracking to estimate behaviours. Detection of feeding behaviour is highly accurate 99.4 and fast 0.02 sec image . The robust method can be applied under different husbandry management conditions.
1601,Crop height and density estimation ahead of the combine harvester have been investigated over the last 30 years but they remain a challenge . LiDAR technology is increasingly being investigated for phenotyping and monitoring of cereals . However so far little has been published about the influence of laser mounting position and robust online measurement of height and density from a single LiDAR scan . Therefore the influence of the angle and height of the LiDAR mounting on crop height and density estimation in wheat and barley was investigated in this study . Tests were conducted in different crop heights densities moisture levels and varieties . The crop height was estimated with a root mean squared error of 0.082mat an angle of 90 between the LiDAR scanning plane and the horizontal . Two methods were compared for crop density estimation . The inter percentile and the transversal variance method both successfully predicted the crop density but the variance based method performed better with a coefficient of determination R,LiDAR allows to estimate crop height and density in small grain crop. Crop height cannot be estimated properly at angles to the horizontal below 70. Variance based crop density estimation is robust against small viewing angle variations. LiDAR data correlate better to ears dry mass than to number of tillers.
1602,As the presence of a human observer can influence the behaviour of animals a camera based system in which the cows can not leave the surveyed area and that automatically detects the animals and the areas of the barn used would be a beneficial tool to analyse dairy cattle herd activity . The aim of this study was to provide such a system and to demonstrate it in an example analysis . A group of thirty six Holstein Friesian dairy cows housed at the Chamber of Agriculture in Futterkamp in Northern Germany were recorded with eight cameras . The barn was partitioned into rectangular areas and automated motion detection was implemented and applied to detect the areas with cow activity . For the automated motion detection high evaluation metrics were reached . Area under receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve varied among the cameras from 0.85 to 0.94 respectively 0.68 to 0.95 while accuracies and precision ranged from 0.783 to 0.88 and 0.544 to 0.938 . As an example video recordings from five days in April and June 2019 were used each and compared afterwards . Areas visited more in April or June could be specified and herd preferences in the use of lying cubicles and feeding troughs were revealed . It was found that space usage was most stable in the middle of the period between morning and afternoon milking and it became more unstable towards afternoon milking . The presented tool has the potential to visualise and evaluate dairy cows space usage and was developed in Python code . It is available on GitHub .,An automated camera based system to visualise cows usage of the barn was presented. Understanding herd activity is a matter of good dairy cattle husbandry.

1605,Recent climate change and the increase in unpredictable meteorological disasters has continue to damage greenhouses . Although structural safety standards have been established they do not fully reflect the environment where greenhouses are installed . Existing standard greenhouse designs assume that the boundary conditions are fixed even though the real boundaries move due to the absence of foundations . In this study a structural analysis model was developed that reflects the ground conditions for pipe structures installed without a foundation and their structural safety was reviewed under various levels of snow load . The structural analysis model was developed by applying the prescribed displacement and rotation boundary using values derived from an experiment that was performed considering loading and ground conditions . The developed model was compared with the existing methods considering only fixed and hinged boundaries by examining the bending moments and the axial forces . As the boundary at the ground moved according to the applied load the maximum bending moment reflecting the ground conditions was larger than the result from the fixed boundary . Additionally as the load is gradually increased the stress calculated reflecting the ground conditions was larger than the result from the hinged boundary . Safety review indicated that the marginal snow depth that could be sustained by the structure decreased by up to 25 when the ground condition was reflected . These results suggest that the current structural analysis methods applied to pipe greenhouse structures with no foundations could lead to the structure being under designed .,This study focuses on structural analysis of greenhouse installed without foundation. New advanced structural experiment method is designed to reflect ground condition. Prescribed boundary condition from experiment is used for structural analysis model. Deformed ground makes the boundary more vulnerable than hinged boundary condition.
1606,Designing tillage tools to promote only the necessary amount of soil fragmentation with minimum power input have great potential to reduce production costs concomitantly with environmental impacts . Thus it was developed a model using discrete element method of a bulk soil that accounts for the mechanical behaviour of soil aggregates and implemented an aggregate size classifier algorithm to quantify aggregate size distribution and the location of particle bond breaks promoted by tillage in different positions of the soil bin . Using this numerical approach simulations of tillage activities were carried out for two furrow openers for sugar cane planting a conventional one and a new tool concept with distinct soil fragmentation principle . The calibrated DEM model was able to reproduce the empirical measurements of soil friability and power demand of tillage . Through the model it was possible to quantify the level of soil structural fragmentation caused by tillage revealing specific details of aggregate breakage promoted by the evaluated tools . The new tool concept showed potential to decrease the power demand by 28.5 at the same time it increases the fractal fragmentation by 10 in comparison to the conventional tool . From these simulations it was estimated that the implementation of the new tool in the Brazilian sugarcane production may reduce fuel consumption by up to 16 .,Numerical model accounts for soil structural fragmentation and power demand. Fractal fragmentation affords the quantification of tillage tools efficiency. Rotary hoe enhances the energy efficiency of furrow opening in sugarcane planting.

In the machine vision system of a harvesting robot in a single view the visible area of a target is often incomplete and therefore can not be directly used to accurately determine the target location . A 3D shape completion method is proposed that can be used on the partially visible images of strawberries obtained from a single view . This method proposed a given number of symmetric plane candidates based on the assumption that the targets are symmetrical which is normally true for fruits such as such apples citrus fruits and strawberries .

1624,In precision livestock farming individual identification and analysis of feeding behaviour have a great impact on optimising the productivity and improving health monitoring . The sensors usually used to measure several parameters from an individual dairy cow are invasive uncomfortable and stressful for animals . To overcome these limits we have developed a non invasive system based entirely on image analysis .

1625,Oil based emulsions are commonly formulations in agricultural spraying but their spray break up behaviour and droplet characteristics differ from those when water is sprayed . In this paper the effect of spray structure on the droplet characteristics droplet size distribution and droplet velocity were investigated using the high speed photomicrography and image processing . Formation of the typical spray structure and the effect of emulsion concentration and spray pressure on the spray structure and droplets characteristics were analysed . Results show that the use of oil based emulsion decreases the liquid sheet area and the flapping form of break up when compared to water sprays and it is this change that is responsible for the increase of droplet size . Thus oil based emulsion sprays have a narrower droplet size distribution due to the limited amount of liquid sheet flapping and the subsequent changes break up structure . The decrease of flapping increases the velocity of the droplets in oil based emulsion spray by 43 compared with the water spray . Emulsion sprays typically have both flapping and perforating break up mechanisms when the emulsion concentration is low and the spray pressure is high . The results in this paper indicate that the perforating break up mechanism can dominate the flapping mechanism when spray pressure is 0.3MPa and the emulsion concentration 0.1 .,Quantitative information of liquid sheet is obtained via image processing methods. The effects of break up structure on the droplet characteristics are investigated. A hypothesis on the formation of spray structure of emulsion and water is proposed. A competition arises between flapping and perforation mechanisms in emulsion spray. The competition is influenced by the spray pressure and the emulsion concentration.

It was found that for each Celsius degree that the water temperature decreased below the input wet bulb temperature the output dry bulb temperature decreased by 0.7C and the output relative humidity increased by 1 .,An evaporative pad cooling model is validated using wind tunnel and dairy barn tests. A new expression for computing heat and mass transfer coefficients was developed. Simulations show that water temperature can be used to control the output variables. The model proposed can be used to dimension evaporative pad cooling systems.

In this study a separator composed of subdivided air streams was developed to separate tender collected seedlings into individuals . The air streams for separation were generated by a jetting nozzle array of subdivided air streams at the base of the separator . By opening and closing different subdivided air stream nozzles in turn seedlings became suspended with some seedlings at the edge of the floating mass becoming separated . The separator was tested using aubergine and cucumber seedlings intended for grafting and for anthurium seedlings intended for cuttage transplanting . The results demonstrated that the separator could separate tender collected seedlings into individuals without causing damage . Moreover the maximum separation rates for the collected seedlings were 11 070 13 590 and 17 100 plants per hour for the aubergine cucumber and anthurium seedlings respectively .,Tender collected seedlings could be separated by subdivided air streams. Jet flow array was used to generate subdivided air streams. The effects of jet pressure operation time and seedling thickness were investigated. Separation rates of some grafting and cuttage seedlings were over 11 070 plants h
1630,The early non destructive detection of chilling injury in aubergine fruit was investigated using spectroscopy . CI is a physiological disorder that occurs when the fruit is subjected to temperatures lower than 12C . Reference measurements of CI were acquired by visual appearance analysis measuring electrolyte leakage mass loss and firmness evaluations which demonstrated that even before three days of storage at 2C the CI process was initiated . An ANOVA simultaneous component analysis was used to investigate the effect of temperature and storage time on the Fourier transform near infra red spectral fingerprints . The ASCA model demonstrated that temperature duration of storage and their interaction had a significant effect on the spectra . In addition it was possible to highlight the main variations in the experimental results with reference to the effects of the main factors and with respect to storage time to discover any major monotonic trends with time . Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used as a supervised classification method to discriminate between fruit based on chilling and safe temperatures . In this case only significant spectral wavebands which were significantly influenced by the effect of temperature based on ASCA were utilised . PLS DA prediction accuracy was 87.42.7 as estimated by a repeated double cross validation procedure and the significance of the observed discrimination was verified by means of permutation tests . The outcomes of this study indicate a promising potential for near infra red spectroscopy to provide non invasive rapid and reliable detection of CI in aubergine fruit .,ASCA method was applied to aubergine fruit stored at safe and chilling temperature. All main factors and their interaction had a significant effect on FT NIR spectra. The most affected spectra introduced by ASCA were assigned as PLS DA input. PLS DA successfully classified aubergine based on their storage temperature.

1633,In tea brick fermentation the temperature in the fermentation chamber has an important influence on the reproduction and growth of the golden flower bacteria inside tea bricks . In order to form a uniform and suitable fermentation temperature the study introduced an upward vertical wall attached ventilation based on the load distribution characteristics of the tea brick fermentation chamber and the practical placement of tea bricks on the shelf . The air distribution of upward vertical wall attached ventilation under different supply air temperature differences was numerically investigated by a mathematical model of flow and heat transfer . Furthermore the results were compared with two other traditional ventilation modes which are diffuser ventilation and displacement ventilation . The upward vertical wall attached ventilation demonstrated higher ventilation efficiency and least vertical temperature stratification due to its lower flow resistance . Thus the temperature unevenness coefficient in the product area could be reduced by between 54.3 and 77.5 compared with the diffuser dilute ventilation and displacement ventilation . Moreover the upward vertical wall attached ventilation could help to eliminate the indoor heat load during the fermentation of tea bricks which increases the energy utilisation rate of supply air by 1.7 18.5 . Therefore the vertical wall attached ventilation can effectively improve the temperature distribution of the tea brick fermentation chamber and improve the energy utilisation of the air supply .,Attached ventilation flow and heat and mass transfer were simulated numerically. Air distribution could reduce heat load effect giving more uniform fermentation environment. Better distribution avoided temperature stratification and improved energy use.

1635,Yield mapping for citrus fruit is a challenging task due to factors such as varying illumination conditions clustering and occlusions . Mapping the yield for immature citrus fruit presents an additional challenge that is the colours of fruit and leaves are almost identical . Commonly used machine vision techniques using colour cameras become less effective for immature citrus fruit detection . This study explores a novel active thermal imaging method to tackle the problem of colour similarity between immature citrus fruit and leaves . In this study a thermal camera was combined with a water spray system that applied water mist to citrus trees . The water mist caused temperatures of both the fruit and leaf surfaces to change but at different rates . Multiple parameters of the spray system were experimented with the goal to induce as much temperature differences as possible between fruit and leaf surfaces . The combined system was tested in a citrus grove for fruit detections . Deep learning models were built based on the active thermal imaging system and tracking and fruit counting algorithms were created to count fruit in thermal videos .

Novel water spray system induces temperature differences between objects. Various environmental and design parameters for outdoor thermal imaging assessed.
1636,Atomisation of agricultural spray solutions through nozzles is a mechanism for delivering pesticides to their target site . Previous research using mechanistic methods has shown that oil in water formulations produce more placid liquid sheets and succumb to a breakup mechanism that begins when holes nucleate within the liquid sheet caused by inhomogeneities of the spray system . The relationships between image analysis metrics obtained from spray images and the resulting atomisation droplet size were explored to estimate drop size statistics from image features . Breakup patterns for oil in water formulations obtained from high speed videos were used with deep learning techniques Monte Carlo dropout methodology and recurrent neural networks to predict droplet size . The videos used were part of a statistical design of experiment reported by Cryer etal . . A total of 353 694 train images and 174 208 test images of atomisation were used . Prediction time for the CNN model with standard dropout regularisation was rapid and achieved 99.4 accuracy whilst the CNN with MC dropout took longer depending on how many forward passes were used but achieved 99.8 and had the ability to estimate uncertainty . The 3D convolution model provided a simpler alternative than the CNN RNN model at reduced CPU intervals . Therefore any of these deep learning methods can be suitable to address the prediction atomisation spray performance based upon images of oil in water emulsion spray patterns at the nozzle .,Deep learning applied to video images of atomisation process. Droplet size estimated from image analysis metrics and image features. 3 different methods explored all with excellent results.
1637,In a plant factory improper design of the indoor ventilation system may cause tip burn on lettuce plants due to the existence of stagnant air in the leaf boundary layer and low transpiration rates .

1638,Tractors are widely used in agricultural production as the main agricultural power machinery . Hence in terms of understanding the airborne emissions produced by agriculture it is important to study the microscopic characteristics of soot particulate matter in tractor exhaust . The morphology and internal structure of soot particles emitted from an agricultural tractor under different operating conditions were examined using transmission electron microscope and were then analysed by digital image processing technology . The results revealed a close relationship between the working conditions of tractor and the morphology and structure of soot particles produced . Firstly the fringe length of soot particles was between 0.2 and 3nm and its mean fluctuated between 0.5 and 0.9nm secondly the fringe tortuosity was between 1 and 1.6 and its mean fluctuated between 1.11 and 1.15 . Finally the fringe separation was mainly distributed between 0.28 and 0.52nm and its mean fluctuated between 0.39 and 0.41nm . Changes in the tractor operating conditions showed that as the engine load increased the fringe length increased the tortuosity and separation of the fringes decreased the arrangement of fringes became more regular the degree of graphitisation increases oxidation activity decreased and the soot particles became more stable . This work contributes to research into the mechanism of the formation of particulate matter and is also beneficial for assessing environmental impacts from the detailed morphological characteristics of soot particles .,Exhaust sampling of a tractor engine in practical working conditions was collected. Morphology of particulate matters from agricultural tractor were measured in TEM. Fringe parameters of particle were analysed by digital image processing technology.

1639,Agricultural machinery is crucial to agriculture because it enables field activities and production in large scale . Through mechanisation agriculture requires inputs such as fuel and indirectly demands materials . Its impact can be assessed through energy water and carbon footprints . Some studies have updated indices for agricultural machinery showing different results from those of the 1970s and 1980s . This study presents environmental indices based on energy carbon and water footprints for the life cycle of six types of agricultural machinery . The machines studied were tractors sugarcane harvesters coffee harvesters sprayers planters and combiners . Inputs used directly and for the maintenance phase have been taken into account . The total energy carbon and water footprints were by multiplying the material flows by their respective energy embodiments consumed water and carbon footprints indices . Carbon steel accounted for the highest share of energy demand 4579 of carbon footprint and 1959 of water footprint . However the coffee harvester was an exception since it used nylon making it the machinery with the largest water footprint . Repair and maintenance accounted for a smaller share of all footprints except for the sugarcane harvester . The water footprint was from 21 to 55m for tractors and between 35 and 391m,Studies of energy carbon and water footprint of agricultural machinery are rare. Carbon and water footprint values provided for six types of agricultural machines. Data to subsidise further environmental impacts of machinery are presented. Carbon steel was material with highest energy emissions and water footprints.
1640,Effective ventilation reduces heat stress in sows . A numerical study was carried out to investigate the effects of airspeed and direction on the convective heat transfer around a sow having different postures and body mass . The convection characteristics of a sow were analysed in a virtual wind tunnel using computational fluid dynamics tools . The four postures of the standing sitting reclining and lateral lying were included . The investigated sow masses ranged from 130kg to 340kg . The results show that 1 The general convective heat transfer was higher when the sow was standing or sitting postures rather than in a reclining or lateral lying posture 2 Wind direction affects the sow convective heat transfer coefficient . The convective heat transfer coefficient of a sow was largest when it was standing or sitting with the body axis 60 to wind direction . When reclining or lateral lying sow axis at 45 to wind direction the convective heat transfer coefficient was the largest 3 The convective heat transfer coefficient of a single sow can be used to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient of a sow amidst rows of multiple sows 4 Sow body mass negatively affects the convective heat transfer coefficient 5 The convective heat transfer coefficient of the sow s trunk is relatively low compared with other parts such as the legs head etc . Based on these results when a sow needs to be cooled during hot conditions an oblique airflow is recommended and airflow speed around the sow s trunk should be increased as much as possible .,Lowest sow heat transfer coefficient in reclining posture compared to others. Airspeed and direction affected sow convective heat transfer coefficient. Local convective heat transfer coefficient on trunk lowest compared to others.

1641,In horticulture measuring sorting by shape and determining the size and volume of fruits are all essential processes for meeting market quality standards and increasing market value . Fruit sorting and grading processes are very laborious and time consuming task but machine vision based fruit grading systems have the potential to replace human labour . However a great challenge in vision based fruit grading system is the recognition of different features such as shape size skin flaw and sometimes even three dimensional shape . In this study a simple and efficient image processing algorithm is proposed for estimating volume and 3D shape of mango fruit . The width and length of mango fruit are obtained from two dimensional colour image . Then fruit thickness is estimated based on light intensity distribution in 2D of mango fruit and maximum widththickness correlation . The 3D shape of the mango fruit is then reconstructed .

1642,With the application of hyperspectral imaging systems on high throughput plant phenotyping multivariable spectral data modelling methods have been proposed to predict plant physiological features such as biomass . However most presented modelling methods are linear models such as the regression model between projected leaf area and plant biomass which can not accurately reflect some non linear relationships between hyperspectral imaging information and the phenomes to be predicted . Therefore it is important to develop a prediction model for plant physiological features that fully utilises the information in plant hyperspectral images . In this paper a non linear modelling method known as kernel partial least squares was investigated to improve the prediction performance of maize biomass . The main idea of KPLS is mapping the original input features into higher dimensional feature spaces before obtaining the principle components for a standard PLS model . In the new mapping spaces the original nonlinear inputs may exhibit linear patterns with different kernel functions . This method was tested in a greenhouse assay containing 102 maize plants which were subjected to a combination of three water treatments and two nitrogen treatments at three different growth stages . KPLS methods were successfully applied on the collected hyperspectral images . The results showed that compared with conventional linear models statistics including R,Proposed KPLS model with RBF kernel more accurately predicts maize fresh weight. Kernel functions map original features into higher dimensional feature spaces. Hyperspectral image provides image derived features for biomass prediction. Performances of projected leaf area linear PLS and KPLS models are investigated. We conduct a greenhouse phenotyping assay to explore maize biomass prediction models.
1643,The relationship between seed physical characteristics and seed quality is widely investigated by using X ray based imaging techniques . Recently the use of X ray micro tomography is increasingly used for more accurate characterisation of the internal seed morphology . In this work a germination test was carried out along with the morphometric characterisation of tomato seed internal structure by means of X ray micro CT and 3D image analysis . The aim was to accurately evaluate the predictive potential of internal seed 3D morphology for germination outcomes . The visual assessment allowed the relationship between specific internal seed abnormalities and the different germination outcomes to be demonstrated experimentally . Univariate analysis of morphometric seed traits allowed 3D free space and Sauter diameter among the most discriminant parameters to be identified as the most effective for the prediction of germination outcomes . Discriminant Analysis of 3D morphometric dataset correctly classified 96.3 of normal seedlings 83.3 of ungerminated seeds and 63.6 of abnormal seedlings providing a high overall prediction potential of 91.9 . The above analyses have also been performed referring to the germination at 5 days after sowing . As a side effect of the applied technique an increase of abnormal seedlings was observed at increasing X ray exposure level .,X ray microCT allows accurate investigation of tomato seed internal 3D morphology. 3D free space is singularly the most effective parameter to predict germination outcomes. Defects in whole embryo endosperm and cotyledons in order resulted the most critical. LDA of 3D morphometric dataset correctly classifies germination outcomes of 91.9 seeds. X ray exposure increases abnormal seedlings but not dead and ungerminated seeds.
1644,The prediction of soil sinkage under wheels and tracks is of significant importance for determining the off road vehicle performance and level of compaction of agricultural soils . Bekker s theory for pressure and sinkage relationship has been widely applied to estimate the vehicle mobility performance for designing off road vehicles for deformable terrains . However the Bekker s constants which reflect the soil sinkage and behaviour of soil under load vary significantly among soils . There is a paucity of studies on paddy soils in the plastic state . Furthermore the determination of soil stiffness constants via pressuresinkage tests is usually time consuming . In this study the impact of three soil physical properties including soil water content clay content and density on the soil stiffness constants for sinkage behaviour in paddy soils was assessed based on experimental results . Subsequently numerical models were established to quantify the Bekker s stiffness constants measured from soil bin tests using soil physical properties . Three quadratic polynomial regression models were established and evaluated to quantify the three constants using soil water content clay content and density . The P values from goodness of fit tests suggested significant fit and insignificant unfit between the simulated and experimental results . The established models were further validated using the soil samples with different physical properties . The comparisons between soil stiffness constants predicted using the model with laboratory measured values indicated satisfactory model performances R,Soil stiffness constants of paddy soil in plastic state were firstly studied. Impacts of soil physical properties on Bekker s parameters were assessed. Models were established to estimate soil stiffness constants using soil properties.
1645,Advanced slurry processing is being promoted to generate renewable energy reduce ammonia emissions and optimise storage and transport respectively . However these processes could affect slurry phosphorus forms and bioavailability and hence P dynamics in soil after application . This study investigated the effect of slurry processing viz . separation acidification and anaerobic digestion on P forms and distribution of cattle slurry as well as P dynamics in soil following application of mechanically separated solid and liquid cattle slurry . The results showed that acidification and anaerobic digestion had little impact on TP distribution among particle fractions of slurry but had substantial influence on P speciation and distribution . Acidification increased the dissolved inorganic P IPH,Acidification increased labile inorganic P in cattle manure by dissolution. Anaerobic digestion increased labile inorganic P in cattle manure by degradation. Particles 63m accounted for the majority of P present in cattle manure. Anaerobic digestion increased mass proportion of the 63m particles. Slurry processing controls soluble P in soil but not the moderately labile P.
1646,The differences between temperatures in the animal occupied zone and temperatures measured by control system sensors are rarely explored . This experimental study quantifies the dry bulb air temperature distribution inside a finisher pig building that combines natural ventilation through automatically controlled openings with a mechanical ventilation system . Year long temperature data from 28 sensors located at 3 different heights in the building was analysed to help understand the temperature distributions and indicate the temperatures below or above an assumed optimal temperature range defined as between 14C and 24C . Relatively large variations in the spatial temperature distribution were found and they were higher in the vertical direction than in the longitudinal direction . The temperatures measured in the AOZ at 0.25m height were on average 7C warmer than that at 1.5m height . The AOZ temperature correlated better with temperatures measured at 0.7m or 1.5m height in the same pen than with temperatures measured in the AOZ at other pens . The analyses show that a proportionalintegral based control system effectively counteracts the effects of outdoor wind conditions and the control system is capable of maintaining the defined optimal temperature at the measurement height . However the optimum temperatures at the measurement heights above AOZ do not correspond to the measured temperatures in the AOZ .,Temperature gradients exist in both vertical and horizontal direction. Average temperatures at 0.25m were 7C warmer than at 1.5m for 50 of time. Temperature gradients were worst during the winter and periods with no wind. Maintaining optimal temperature at control sensors alone is not sufficient for pigs. Temperatures experienced by pigs are not reflected by control temperatures.
1647,Core objectives of precision agriculture are to improve the economic and environmental performance of agricultural systems . This study used a long term experiment in citrus to assess whether site specific nutrient management was successful from these two perspectives . Variable and uniform rate fertilisation treatments were implemented in intercalated strips across two 25ha citrus groves in So Paulo state Brazil . To generate variable rate recommendations information from soil fertility and yield maps were fed into a traditional recommendation formula used by growers . The experiment was carried out for five growing seasons . An economic energy and nutrient balance analysis was conducted . Variable rate application increased average yield in grove 1 but sometimes reduced yield in grove 2 . As a consequence profit was increased by 34.7 US,A five year study was used to evaluate variable rate fertilisation in orange groves. Economic and environmental performance were spatially variable within orange groves. Environmental indicators were usually superior with variable rate application. Mixed economic results were found for variable rate application. Variable rate application must not rely on global recommendation rules.

1650,Global warming has caused an increase in frequency and degree of heat stress over the last decades . In conventional livestock husbandry systems with insulated buildings mechanical ventilation systems and high stocking density pigs and poultry can be more affected by climate change than in free range husbandry systems . To reduce heat stress in livestock buildings adaptation measures are used . This article assesses a wide variety of adaptation measures including energy saving air treatment systems which cool the inlet air the use of certain building elements optimising building characteristics modification of the indoor climate at the animal level and adaptation of livestock management . The efficacy of some of these measures was quantified using simulation models and then used as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of other measures . The efficacy of the various adaptation measures varies widely air treatment devices which are cooling the inlet air showed the highest performance while measures aimed at reducing the heat release of the animals performed poorest . In confined livestock systems the reduction of heat stress by implementing adaptation measures will reduce economical losses . The selection of appropriate adaptation measures in addition to improving animal welfare can also be seen as a contribution to strengthen the economic resilience of farmers .,Global warming has a strong impact on livestock kept inside buildings. Effective adaptation measures are available to reduce heat stress for animals. The achievable heat reduction depends on the selected system. The best result can be achieved by air treatment systems. Model calculations are appropriate to evaluate the efficacy.

The system consisted of 7 base stations and multiple tracker tags and the determination of tags positions was based on time of arrival . For locating stationary tags the system achieved 0.37m accuracy at 1m height and 0.50m accuracy at 0.3m height . While tracking moving tags at 1m height 0.38m accuracy was achieved . Three filters were tested to further improve the positioning performance . The median filter had the highest improvement on locating stationary and moving tags . The bilateral filter had a balanced capability of uncovering complex moving trajectories . The double exponential moving average filter was more suited when real time updates were required . The overall results showed that tracking group housed sows inside a pig barn was feasible using the UWB positioning system .,A UWB positioning system achieved 0.5m positioning accuracy using in a sow barn. The positioning accuracy was dependent on the location and height of tracker tags. Filters were more effective for improving tracking precision than accuracy. The choice of filters depends on the motion characteristics and the application.

1653,This research studied microclimate and evapotranspiration of pepper in high tunnel screenhouses and greenhouses . A study was carried out during three consecutive seasons 20152016 20162017 and 20172018 in two high tunnels . One was covered by a plastic sheet and the other by a porous screen . Other than the covers the structures were identical . In both houses microclimate variables were measured simultaneously above the canopy .

Measured transpiration was compared with model estimates of ET to identify the model in best agreement with measurements . Linear regressions between internal and external climatic conditions resulted in R,Pepper transpiration and microclimate were measured in high tunnels. Various models estimated ET in a greenhouse and a screenhouse. Screenhouse microclimate interacted with the outside more than the greenhouse did. Models using internal conditions were better than those using external climate.
1654,In the calculation of wind effects on civil constructions the pressure coefficients which are usually obtained from specific standards or by tests of reduced models in wind tunnels are essential and these coefficients are commonly established from solid and undeformable models . For greenhouses covered with plastic film due to the flexibility of this material there are instantaneous modifications to the shape of the construction by the action of the wind . The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of pressure coefficients on arched roof greenhouses displaced by the wind action transverse to the ridge . To achieve this goal computational fluid dynamics models were used to obtain the pressure coefficients in greenhouses with ratios between height and span of 0.3 and 0.6 . The change in the shape of the greenhouse due to the displacements imposed by the wind showed that there were no relevant variations in the pressure coefficients of the wall zones . However the effects of shape displacement were very significant along the extension of the arch of the roof with a large reduction in the pressure coefficients mainly in the vicinity of the ridge .,The shape of the greenhouse is modified instantaneously by the action of the wind. Wind effects are extremely important in the conception of greenhouse designs. Pressure coefficients are affected by the modification of the greenhouse shape. The inversion of the pressure coefficient on arched roof occurs close to the gutter. The greatest pressure amplitudes occur in a zone that includes the ridge.
1655,Slightly sprouted wheat kernels are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye and the mixing of sprouted kernels into sound wheat kernels will seriously reduce the quality of wheat products . This study explored the use of near infrared hyperspectral imaging technology to identify sound wheat kernels and slightly sprouted wheat kernels and obtained hyperspectral images on both sides of each wheat kernel . A variety of common spectral preprocessing methods and two characteristic extraction algorithms and successive projections algorithm were used to combine two traditional machine learning models and support vector machine and a special deep learning model to establish classification models . After analysis it was found that the modelling effect of using the reverse side spectral data was slightly better than the ventral side spectral data and the SavitzkyGolay smoothing CARS DF model was the optimal model combination . Finally combined with actual needs the modelling effect of the characteristic wavelengths extracted from the reverse side spectral data in the mixed spectral data sets containing different ratios of reverse side spectral data was analysed and the results were also satisfactory . The results showed that it was better to calibrate the model with the hyperspectral data on the reverse side of wheat kernels as this would be more helpful for identifying sound and slightly sprouted wheat kernels .,NIR hyperspectral imaging technology was used to identify sprouted wheat kernels. The hyperspectral data on both sides of wheat kernels were analysed. Model calibrated using the reverse side spectral data of wheat kernels performed better. This study provides a basis for development of multi spectral online detection system.

The calorimetric radiation detector was built using micro nano fabrication techniques and consists of an SU 8 photoresist absorber and high sensitivity vanadium oxide VO,For the first time the feasibility of a chip calorimeter as a radiation detector was demonstrated. Microscale radiation absorber of SU 8 was constructed on top of high sensitivity VO. thermistors. The calorimetric detector enabled precise measurements of X ray dose rate.
1692,We numerically and experimentally investigate single band and dual band isotropic metamaterial absorbers based on metallic disks . By optimizing the diameter of the metallic disks and the thickness of the dielectric substrate the single band IMA is observed at 16.2GHz with absorptivity of 97 . When adding one disk pair to the structure the dual band IMA is obtained at 12.8 and 15.5GHz due to the symmetry breaking . The physical mechanics is explained by near field coupling effect and equivalent LC circuit model . The measurement results performed in the range 1218GHz show a good agreement with simulation and theoretical analysis . Our findings demonstrate a new approach to achieve dual band and multi band IMAs .,Single band and dual band isotropic metamaterial absorbers IMAs based on disk resonators. Single band and dual band IMAs are obtained by asymmetric structure and near field coupling effect. Dual band and multi band can be adjusted by the thickness of dielectric layer and the diameter of metallic disks. A new simple and effective approach to achieve dual band and multi band IMAs.
1693,Square dancing is a popular public activity performed in squares and parks in Chinese cities . Although dancers benefit from such activity physically and mentally nearby residents may suffer from noise pollution and other negative externalities . However only a few existing studies have explored the effects of square dancing on the value of residential properties and open spaces . To fill this knowledge gap this study utilizes the hedonic price model and spatial econometric model to investigate the external effects of square dancing in the housing market of Hangzhou China . Results show that nearby housing price drops by 5.8 and 13.0 when people dance in the nearest park and square . In addition square dancing decreases the value of parks and squares and this mediating effect shows spatial heterogeneity . The results of this study indicate that square dancing has a significant negative external effect on housing price and the value of open space . This study offers implications for policy makers to achieve a harmonious society and humanized urban planning . The findings and implications of this study ensure the benefits of residents and improve the value of residential properties and open spaces . In addition the findings can be generalized across cities or countries where square dancing and other human activities are popular .,Square dancing is proved to decrease nearby housing price significantly. Dance in square shows a stronger external effect on housing price than dance in park. Square dancing mediates the premium of open space in the housing market. Spatial heterogeneity is observed in this mediating effect of square dancing.
1694,In urban environments long term tree survival and performance requires physiological tolerance or phenotypic plasticity in plant functional traits . Knowledge of these traits can inform the likely persistence of urban forests under future more severe climates . We assessed the plasticity of morphological and physiological traits of tree species planted along an urban climatic gradient in the Greater Sydney region during a severe multi year drought in eastern Australia . We selected four sites along a 55 km east west transect ranging from the cool wet coast to the warm dry inland . We assessed five tree species with different predicted climatic vulnerability based on climate origins estimating functional traits indicative of drought tolerance carbon isotope composition,Urban trees presented functional adaptations in response to local climate. Urban trees had different levels of trait plasticity along a climatic gradient. Turgor loss point was the best surrogate for changes in precipitation and maximum temperature. Leaf level traits showed a greater plasticity across species and sites.
1695,Extensive gaps in invasive plant species research in terms of ecosystem distribution and impact are major barriers faced by global decision making bodies for scientific management of plant species invasions of native flora . Effective strategies need to be worked out which would enable simultaneous management and the use of invasive plant species for ecosystem restoration . For evaluating the photosynthetic potential of invasive plant species in restoration of degraded areas exhaustive in situ leaf gas exchange and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence were undertaken on four plants found naturally colonizing on the fly ash deposits . The four invasive species screened for their physiological tolerances towards microclimatic and edaphic stresses in harsh fly ash deposits were,Study reveals the success of fly ash dumpsite restoration by invasive plant species. is highly efficient in sequestering of CO. emissions in fly ash dump. C4 species should be given more weightage in fly ash dumpsite revegetation programs. suitable for fly ash ponds due to moisture loving nature.
1696,Green infrastructure practices consisting of using vegetation and soil to manage stormwater runoff has been adopted by cities across the world to help address aging water infrastructure water quality excess water quantity and urban planning needs . Although GIs contribution to stormwater control and management has been extensively studied the economic value of its benefits is less known . In Omaha NE GI projects have been completed in several public parks . Using a repeat sales model based on 20002018 housing data we examined the effect of GI on the value of single family homes within various buffer distances of parks where GI was installed . After controlling for changes associated with home deterioration and renovation non stationary location effects and time invariant characteristics we did not find any statistically significant relationships between housing values and GI . This finding is consistent with the notion that homeowners place little value on modifications to existing greenspace but may also stem from homeowners lack of familiarity with GI practices or data limitations .,A repeat sales model assessed how installing GI in parks affects nearby home values. The data consisted of 25 472 sales pairs 20002018 from Omaha NE USA. We found no significant effects of GI on home values. Homeowners likely place little to no value on the assessed greenspace modifications.
1697,With the increasing demand for forest tourism and forest leisure space in recent years providing a high quality forest landscape space to participants has become an increasingly important topic for designers and managers of forest parks . To clarify differences in the visual behavior characteristics and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants when viewing different types of forest landscape spaces and to explore the relationship between them in order to identify the psychological evaluation factors that affect visual behavior . This analysis will provide a theoretical basis and a basis for the construction and reconstruction of forest park landscape spaces even for new forests in the future . This study used eye tracking technology and cognitive questionnaires for participants . ANOVA and Spearman s rho correlation analysis in SPSS 23.0 were used to statistically analyze the data . 1 . There are differences in participants visual behavior especially in visual spans when participants appreciate different types of forest landscape spaces . The visual span of forest waterscape space is small while the visual span of in forest landscape space is large . 2 . There are differences in participants psychological cognitive evaluations of different types of forest landscape spaces . The forest waterscape space is evaluated highly on multiple indicators especially for dynamic water space whereas for in forest landscape space participants also pay attention to unique or interesting landscape elements with the exception of color and plants . 3 . There are correlations between the mean visual span mean pupil diameter and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants in different types of forest landscape spaces . When people admire scenes with diverse plant species rich landscape content good landscape depth and permeability rich and bright color open and tidy spaces and good landscape permeability and layering their mean pupil diameter and lateral and portrait visual span are small . Based on the above analysis we recommend that when planning and designing forest landscape space we should consider not only the characteristics of different types of landscape spaces and their visual and cognitive effects for participants but also the combination of some iconic elements or interesting landscape elements .,Use eye tracking technology to analyze the visual behavior characteristics and differences of different types of forest landscape spaces. Analyze the psychological cognitive evaluation and differences of different types of forest landscape spaces. Explore the relationship between visual behavior and psychological cognitive evaluation of different types of forest landscape spaces.
1698,Urban parks and tree lined streets are major components of urban greenspaces as well as the most frequently used public spaces for senior citizens . Studies have shown significant associations between urban greenspaces and various health outcomes of older adults . However most of them focused on urban parks or overall vegetation coverage and few have considered the impact of street greenery . The lack of research attention on the latter is partly because of no method objectively measuring greenery exposure on streets especially from a pedestrian centered perspective . In the current study we recruited 1161 adults aged 60 or above who lived in 12 housing estates in Wuhan China and collected their socio demographic data and 7 day physical activity data . Streetscape photos were taken by trained researchers on sidewalks of all streets in the 800 m buffers from these housing estates . The pedestrian centered street greenery exposure was extracted from these photos with the machine learning technique of convolutional neural networks along with the pyramid pooling module . Multilevel logistic regression models were conducted to examine the association of the frequency and total duration of physical activity with street greenery . Park area population density street connectivity and land use mix within the buffer zone as well as individual factors were included as covariates in the models . Results showed that street greenery was positively associated with the odds of achieving 300 mins or more of physical activity per week but the park area was not . Furthermore street connectivity and land use mix were positively associated with both the frequency and total time of physical activity . Unexpectedly population density was negatively associated with the frequency and total time of physical activity . Therefore adding street greenery or improving existing street greenery can be a vital environment intervention strategy to create an aging friendly urban environment .,Streetscape photos taken by trained researchers was used to measured street greenery. Street greenery has a positive association with the time of physical activity in older adults. Park area is not significantly associated with the physical level of older adults. The effect of street connectivity and land use mix on physical activity of older adults are positive.
1699,It is important to quantify the value of green space amenities in order to justify the cost of their creation and maintenance furthermore advances in available data and methods have produced exciting ways to measure the economic values of green infrastructure . In this study we use publicly available data from Zillow Inc. to implement the hedonic pricing method at a novel scope and scale . We analyze over 5000 Zillow neighborhoods located in metropolitan areas across 44 states to identify the marginal value of urban green spaces with respect to median neighborhood home prices . By incorporating a vast heterogeneous study area we are able to gain a national scale perspective on the effects of green spaces on home values . Furthermore Zillow neighborhoods permit reproducible extensible and policy relevant insight into the effects of green spaces on neighborhoods holistically . Our results suggest that for Zillow neighborhoods on average the normalized difference vegetation index and open space are dis amenities however parks and tree cover add premiums to Zillow neighborhood value . By interacting tree cover with land surface temperature we find the amenity value of trees is realized in part through shading furthermore we find that tree shading has a greater amenity value in higher income areas .,Zillow Inc. open access data offers potential for large scale hedonic pricing analyses that inform urban greening initiatives. Trees and parks add premiums to home values in metropolitan areas on average whereas un curated vegetation is a dis amenity. We find indications of a positive feedback loop between wealth and tree shade in urban and suburban areas.
1700,Urban green areas are an important part of the cities that provide novel ecosystem for the preservation of many plants and animals . Pollinators are the one animal group that are well adapted to live in the urban environment . However not all green areas in the city affect pollinators equally which is associated with management practices vegetation composition and distance to the city center . Our study was aimed to assess how environmental features and vegetation composition shape the pollinator communities in different habitats in the city . Forty seven squares in the three different urban green areas were established in the Pozna city where the bees butterflies and hoverflies were surveyed . On each square the vegetation and environmental features were estimated . Plant communities composition was different between three habitats which affected pollinators compositions in the city . The NMDS analyses showed that in the case of bees and butterflies plant height and share of built up area explain a high percentage of the variance . Additionally the Plantaginaceae Boraginaceae Asteraceae Lamiaceae Ranunculaceae and Caryophyllaceae families had a significant impact on pollinators . Plants form these families are characterized by the flowers from opened to closed corollas which provide access to nectar and pollen for different pollinator groups . This study demonstrated that both environmental and vegetation features had a significant effect on pollinators species communities composition which is indirectly relate to management practices of these greenery areas . The management policy of greenery landscapes in the city especially in more transformed areas like urban parks and housing estates must consider restricted implement actions leading to a reduction of the number of mowing or and leaving un mowed foraging patches for pollinators .,Urban green areas provide a novel ecosystem for pollinators. Not all greenery in the city affects pollinators equally. Plant compositions different between three habitat type. Vegetation and environmental variables affect pollinators compositions.
1701,In this article we discuss the pros and cons of transdisciplinary research using the results of a research project on lawns carried out in Sweden from 2013 to 2016 . We viewed lawns as a complex ecological and cultural phenomenon and searched for different sustainable lawn solutions in urban areas of Sweden .,Analysis of pros and cons of transdisciplinary research on lawns. Ability to involve stakeholders in different project activities and to disseminate the research results. Ability to incorporate results of natural and social studies into landscape design. Initial concept the management was the central factor. Management routines shape urban green areas and people aesthetical perceptions.
1702,Nocturnal sap flow is an important part of plant sap flow while it is usually regarded as negligible . Consequently the aim of this study was to measure nocturnal stem sap flow of,In urban environment the nocturnal sap flow of Acer truncatum is regulated by nocturnal transpiration and stem refilling and stem refilling should be the fundamental cause of nocturnal sap flow while nocturnal transpiration could promote nocturnal sap flow. The phenomenon of high speed sap flow in low VPD conditions is analyzed and discussed and we suggest nocturnal transpiration only occurs when VPD exceeds 0.10 kPa while stem refilling occurs almost all the time and the main driving force is water demand to support trunk tissue hydration and VPD respectively. Because of the differences between urban environment and natural environment in soil physical properties soil water supply model active root distribution depth humidity and wind speed etc. it is necessary to conduct the research of plant sap flow in an urban green space rather than in the nursery or woodland as in previous studies especially for the important tree species in the nursery industry and urban greening.
1703,Valuing the ecosystem services of urban trees is important for gaining public and political support for urban tree conservation and maintenance . The i Tree Eco software application can be used to estimate regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests . However existing municipal tree inventories may not contain data necessary for running i Tree Eco and manual field surveys are costly and time consuming . Using a tree inventory of Oslo Norway as an example we demonstrate the potential of geospatial and machine learning methods to supplement missing and incomplete i Tree Eco attributes in existing municipal inventories for the purpose of rapid low cost urban ecosystem accounting . We correlate manually surveyed stem diameter and crown dimensions derived from airborne laser scanning imagery to complete most structural attributes . We then use auxiliary spatial datasets to derive missing attributes of trees spatial context and include differentiation of air pollution levels . The integration of Oslos tree inventory with available spatial data increases the proportion of records suitable for i Tree Eco analysis from 19 to 54 . Furthermore we illustrate how machine learning with Bayesian networks can be used to extrapolate i Tree Eco outputs and infer the value of the entire municipal inventory . We find the expected total asset value of municipal trees in Oslo to be 38.543.4 million USD depending on different modelling assumptions . We argue that there is a potential for greater use of geospatial methods in compiling information for valuation of urban tree inventories especially when assessing location specific tree characteristics and for more spatially sensitive scaling methods for determining asset values of urban forests for the purpose of awareness raising . However given the available data in our case we question the accuracy of values inferred by Bayesian networks in relation to the purposes of ecosystem accounting and tree compensation valuation .,Geospatial analysis to supplement i Tree Eco attributes in municipal tree inventory. Bayesian networks to scale i Tree Eco results for entire urban inventory. Spatial differentiation of air pollution levels in i Tree Eco. Policy relevance for Oslo including awareness raising.
1704,Urban ecosystems can host a considerable amount of biodiversity because of the varying habitats created during urban development processes . Spontaneous vegetation is a neglected element of urban biodiversity and the roles of a citys natural floristic resources geomorphic features and topographic characteristics in shaping spontaneous plant diversity patterns have not been fully clarified . We explored the impact of urban growth and elevation and slope on the diversity patterns of urban spontaneous plant communities in a mountainous city in southwest China . We recorded 279 species belonging to 210 genera and 70 families with native species accounting for about 85 of the urban spontaneous plants . The magnitude of urban growth and elevation were the most important drivers and they were positively correlated with the diversity patterns in Chongqing . Thus both urban forms and the citys natural conditions are important in affecting the urban biodiversity patterns . Furthermore urban spontaneous plant communities in Chongqing metropolis were mainly dominated by a few widespread cosmopolitan species with nearly 50 of the 279 species we recorded being narrowly distributed and rarely occurring species . The distribution of the rare spontaneous species may be highly dependent on chance dispersal the legacies of earlier land use and the availability of specific habitats . We propose that urban construction and landscape design should maintain appropriate configurations for the habitat type to preserve rarely occurring plant species to increase biodiversity in urban landscapes .,Spontaneous plant communities in Chongqing Metropolis included 279 species. Native species accounted for about 85 of the urban spontaneous plants. Regional species pool decreased with increasing levels of urbanization intensification. Habitat types and qualities affected the composition of spontaneous plant communities.
1705,Cities around the world are pursuing tree planting as a way to increase tree cover . Despite the growing interest in planting trees as a way to offset climate change counter the negative impacts of urbanization and provide benefits to city dwellers there has not been a recent effort to quantify the number of trees being planted nor the species composition of these plantings . Because ecosystem services and ecosystem threats can transcend municipal boundaries understanding trends in tree planting at multiple spatial scales is critical . To overcome this knowledge gap we used a survey to collate recent tree planting data from 52 cities with populations greater than 50 000 people in the Northeastern USA . The four largest cities in our study planted over 87 of all the trees that were planted in the region . Smaller cities which are numerous in region planted proportionally fewer trees and in over 40 of the small cities surveyed planting palettes included invasive tree species highlighting both a resource and a knowledge gap in smaller cities as compared with larger ones . Regardless of city size records also illuminated an overreliance on certain genera for specific ecosystem services nearly 20 of all shade trees were,We collected recent tree planting data from 52 Northeastern USA cities. Collectively these cities planted over half a million trees from 2012 to 2017. Over half of the trees planted were in the cherry legume maple or oak families. Trees planted include three confirmed and six potentially invasive species.
1706,Research on public open spaces and well being benefits has been extensively studied in developed countries such as in Australia Europe and America however in developing countries such as Bangladesh there is very limited research . This study carried out in six popular POS in Chittagong Bangladesh explored visitors activities in POS and their perception on well being outcomes . It also assessed visitors characteristics their perceived health status features of POS and collective activities such as informal POS associations . Data were collected using structured interviews of 181 randomly approached POS visitors key informant interviews with presidents members of four associations related to POS and personal observations . About 80 of the respondents were 3160 years old and the mean body mass index of the respondents was 26.7 . Up to 18 of respondents particularly women and younger people were concerned about obesity hypertension and elevated sugar level . Most of the respondents lived nearby and visited their local POS 57 days per week primarily for walking or light jogging . Around 80 of respondents perceived that physical activities in POS helped reduce or maintain their body weight and prevent hypertension and 45 perceived that physical activities in POS reduced cholesterol blood sugar and liver fat . Another 70 respondents perceived that activities in POS could contribute to an active lifestyle increase energy levels and enhance their thinking ability and level of confidence . Our findings suggest that the expansion and management of POS such as urban green spaces and encouraging the public to undertake green exercise could be an important public health intervention in Bangladesh and elsewhere .,Limited research on public open space POS and well being relationship in developing countries. Up to 18 of respondents were concerned about obesity hypertension and elevated sugar level. Physical activities in POS had positive influence on well being. Visiting POS encouraged to form informal associations. Expansion of POS and green exercise could be an important public health intervention.
1707,Integrating tree species diversity into urban forest management can help create resilient tree populations . In this study the abundance of trees within families genera and species levels was determined through a system developed to evaluate the diversity of urban street trees at different scales . Municipal foresters were asked to report the six street tree species most commonly used in urban forests as an assessment of tree diversity . Through the use of this question in a series of urban forest management surveys we were able to describe the diversity of urban street tree species in the 48 continental United States across time and space . Throughout the United States the top six street tree species were distributed in 115 species 71 genera and 32 families . At the national scale no one tree species or family dominated but the,Tree diversity changes as the scale changes. Little change in street tree species has occurred over 40 years. The majority of street trees in a community can be explained for by 4 to 6 species.
1708,Urban forests play an important role for urban dwellers providing environmental social and economic services . One of these benefits is the capacity of trees to provide food an aspect which as the potential to increase food security that has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years . However there is currently limited information about urban food forests in Brazil . The present study aims to provide an overview of urban food forestry in the country evaluating different aspects . Thirty different initiatives were analysed and the stakeholders and activities involved in the initiatives were evaluated . Moreover 58 Urban Forestry Master Plans were analysed in order to evaluate whether the municipalities considered food production from urban trees . Most of the analysed initiatives include activities related to fruit tree planting in the city being the municipalities the main responsible for such initiatives . Regarding the UFMPs only 12 municipalities considered human food consumption from urban fruit trees . In order to quantify the food production potential from urban trees in a municipality with high vulnerability to food insecurity a detailed study with 3 different scenarios was carried out in Uchoa So Paulo . Trees located on Uchoas streets would have the capacity to provide up to 63.7 of the caloric deficit of the municipality in the best scenario . These findings demonstrate the potential of UFF to tackle food insecurity and highlight the need of a better reflection of this approach in public policies such as UFMPs .,Urban food forestry initiatives in Brazil are quite recent and focus on tree planting. Brazilian Urban Forestry Master Plans generally do not consider food production. Science based participatory debates led to more robust policies on urban forestry. A case study showed the great potential of urban forests to improve food security. There are still many challenges to advance urban food forestry in Brazil.
1709,Urban forests are important hotspots of biodiversity in the environment of cities and their surroundings but may also stand out from neighbouring forests by greater tree species diversity higher tree age and greater share of deciduous species . However they are usually not connected with nesting of rare birds of prey especially dietary specialists . Unexpectedly I have found Honey Buzzard,Successful nesting of rare dietary specialist raptor was noted in an urban forest in Poland. Nesting and foraging of Honey Buzzard male were affected by tree cover density. In this terms urban forest provided best conditions in a 10 km radius.
1710,While cemeteries represent a part of any societys cultural heritage their continued existence in urban areas has raised concerns mainly due to the scarcity of urban land . Referring specifically to the Chinese cemeteries of Kuala Lumpur this paper explored the perceptions among the local Chinese residents of the possible multi dimensional uses of cemeteries for recreational purposes . This issue involves questions of city planning and future land use urban green purposing and the potential contribution of such land to urban fabric enhancement . Specifically the authors intended to identify the influence of demographic profile on perceptions in consideration of future planning of cemeteries for recreational purposes . A total of 403 questionnaire samples were collected for analysis . The analysis findings indicated that the possible use of cemeteries for educational purposes was favoured among the respondents in general with a higher acceptance rate of multiple uses of cemeteries for recreational purposes among younger respondents . Physical design enhancing landscaping avoiding conflicts overuse appropriate safety measures and awareness campaigns are all vital if cemeteries are to be promoted for recreational purposes .,The uses of cemeteries for educational purposes were favoured by the respondents. Higher acceptance by young respondents to use cemeteries for recreational purpose. Physical designs are vital to promote the uses of cemeteries for recreation. Chinese respondents perception of cemeteries uses was influenced by culture.
1711,Green Stormwater Infrastructure is being implemented in cities around the globe . Although we know that GSI improves urban ecosystems in a variety of ways we know little about the extent to which the characteristics of GSI impact human perception and preference . This gap in knowledge necessitates a greater understanding of the relationship between GSI perceptions and preference . Without this knowledge designers and planners risk creating landscapes that people dislike and from which they reap few health benefits .,Images from the groups which include more vegetation are significantly more preferred and perceived as safer and more natural. Images with from the groups which include more bioretention are significantly associated with higher perceived messiness. Perceived safety and naturalness predict preference but perceived messiness does not. Perceived safety naturalness and messiness closely predicted preference.
1712,Encouraging physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviours are key issues in contemporary society . The Active Forest Programme was set up through a partnership between Sport England and Forestry England . A pilot programme ran for three years on five public forest sites in England . A mixed methodology explored what types of sport and physical activities were undertaken what if any were the benefits of undertaking physical activity in a forest environment and was there any evidence of changes in sporting activity . We provide insights into key elements of how the forest based programme aimed to sustain and change physical activity .,The Active Forest programme was set up to encourage sport and physical activity in a forest environment at five sites in England. The research highlights the importance of providing a range of opportunities for people to become physically active. The most popular sport and physical activities were cycling running orienteering bat and racket sports and fitness. There was evidence of physical and mental wellbeing benefits from the quantitative and qualitative research. Insights are provided into how forest interventions can enable people to sustain or become more physically active.
1713,This study aims to determine the physiological and psychosocial effects of forest therapy on the stress levels of middle aged working women . Nineteen middle aged working women participated in a half day forest therapy program conducted at Bukit Ekspo A tree dominated urban park located at the centre of Universiti Putra Malaysia . For the physiological indices the systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate of the participants were evaluated three times a day Before breakfast lunch and dinner . The readings were obtained two days before during and three days after the forest therapy program . The physiological readings obtained two days before the study served as the baseline reading as it represented the normal everyday physiological condition of the participants . The baseline SBP and the baseline DBP of the participants were beyond healthy levels falling into Stage 1 hypertension . The mean SBP of the participants significantly reduced during the forest therapy day and three days after the forest therapy day . This reduction was also observed for the DBP readings whereby the mean DBP readings for the forest therapy day and three days after were lower than the baseline values . There were no significant changes in the pulse rate . For the psychosocial perspective the participants self evaluated themselves to determine the effects of forest therapy on their mental wellbeing . Only 16 of the participants believed that they successfully performed self regulation when faced with stressful situations although 74 of the participants admitted to experiencing stress on a daily basis . After participating in forest therapy the majority of the participants felt rejuvenated and more at ease at work . In conclusion forest therapy is an effective stress management tool for middle aged female employees .,This study aims to determine the potential of forest therapy in managing workplace stress of middle aged working women from physiological and psychosocial perspectives. The forest therapy program was conducted at an urban park making it easily accessible for urban residents. After participating in forest therapy the participants showed a sustained reduction in blood pressure for 3 days. The majority of the participants also felt rejuvenated and more at ease at work.
1714,Urban trees are appreciated for their intrinsic value and their contributions to human well being . Here we analysed a database of 115686 non forest trees to quantify the present contributions of native and non native trees to biodiversity in the metropolitan area of Geneva Switzerland . Non native trees made up 90 of species and 40 of individuals . A subset of these individuals with more detailed phenotypic information was used to quantify five regulating ecosystem services three cultural ecosystem services and two disservices . Non native and native trees generated roughly identical regulating services on a per tree basis as these are linked primarily to tree morphology rather than to tree origin . Non native trees generated cultural ecosystem services that were greater than native trees on a per tree basis with the exception of the notion of natural heritage . For example 79 of trees independently identified as remarkable by the canton of Geneva were non native . Our results illustrate that non native trees represent a significant source of biodiversity and ecosystem services both in absolute terms and on a per tree basis . Given the empirical importance of non native trees in many cities and the likelihood that their importance will increase with future climate change we suggest that non native trees be considered in conservation assessments and strategic planning both for intrinsic reasons and for their contributions to human well being .,90 of tree species and 40 of non forest trees in Geneva are non native. Native and non native trees provide similar regulating services on a per tree basis. Key cultural ecosystem services are dominated by non native trees. Non native trees contribute significantly to regional biodiversity and ecosystem services. Biodiversity indicators should also capture contributions of non native species.
1715,Tree stability evaluation is an important issue with great practical implications . In the recent years tree potential to cause harm has been increasing in consequence of climate change effects mainly related to windstorms and tree diseases that represent the main tree failure causes . A tree owner has a duty of safety imposed by civil and penal laws consequently he must operate an appropriate tree management to avoid foreseeable injuries or harms . A relevant problem arises when tree monitoring concern wide areas like natural park or urban forest in these situations a variety of management factors have to be taken into account the spatial size of the monitored areas the great heterogeneity of trees vegetative conditions the relevant number of trees the balance between environmental protection and safe use of the area the conspicuous cost of controls and technical interventions . With these premises an efficient planning tool is mandatory to manage this complex resource . Geomatics can support these requirements by integrating different techniques like survey spatialization and modelling of territorial environmental variables . In this work authors propose a new approach hereinafter called Precision Arboriculture for tree management fitting extensive contexts requirements . The proposed workflow is mainly based on RPAS photogrammetry technique and is specifically aimed at accurately estimating single tree parameters developing a robust algorithm to assess tree stability with the aim of reducing costs by better addressing ground controls through a spatially based management tool . This technology proved to generate estimates of the main dendrometric parameters with accuracies consistent than the one ordinary required in the arboricultural context . Nevertheless some ground data are however needed to calibrate models and testing accuracy of estimates . The proposed methodology proved to be able to generate an easy to use tool for better address ground controls aimed at testing tree stability and reducing the correlated hazard . Safety Factor map enhances critical trees addressing mitigation actions like tree removal pruning static bracing limitations of people transit under potential tree fall area . The adoption of a quantitative index permits to better balance costs and benefits in a more objective way improving economic efficiency of urban forestry and natural park policies . The method is configuring a new approach in arboricultural field involving new technologies like RPAS photogrammetric survey and skills moving towards a Precision Arboriculture concept .,The RPAS based photogrammetry is used for single tree parameters extraction. Tree stability assessment is performed with reference to biomechanical model. A quantitative index permits to balance costs and improving economic efficiency. A new Precision Arboriculture approach fits extensive contexts requirements is proposed.
1716,It is increasingly evident that the general publics recognition of local flora and fauna is typically inaccurate because the majority of species are not recognized by ordinary people . These incorrect perceptions are a concern because they could lead to decreased public motivation for conservation and reduced health and well being benefits that people gain when interacting with nature . However there remains limited knowledge of how well ordinary people recognize wild plants and animals in their local areas and how the levels of recognition vary among the general public . We conducted a questionnaire survey among urban park users in Zenpukuji Park in Tokyo to assess their levels of recognition of birds and flowering plants and determined the factors that affect their recognition of these taxa . We asked participants to report their own personal characteristics and whether or not they had observed each of 24 common bird and 24 flowering plants species found in the park . Numbers of bird and plant species recognized by participants varied greatly with those who visited the park frequently and who had greater taxonomic knowledge reporting higher numbers . Moreover the traits of each of the study bird and plant species were associated with the numbers of participants who recognized them . Our results suggest that both the individuals personal characteristics and species ecological traits determine park users recognition of local biodiversity . Increasing individuals use of urban greenspace and strengthening their orientation toward and familiarity with wildlife especially species that may be less noticeable would contribute to enhancing their perceptions of the local wildlife .,We performed a questionnaire survey among urban park users in Tokyo. Park users recognition of local bird and plant species was assessed. Peoples levels of recognition of species varied greatly. Recognition of species was linked to peoples personal characteristics. Species traits of wildlife were also associated with recognition of species.
1717,Invasive species are drivers of urban ecosystem transformation . However their management requires cost demanding distributional data . Here we proposed an approach using floristic surveys land use maps and field observations to reveal the patterns responsible for the spread of invasive trees using open source software . We used the tree of heaven,Invasive tree species are relevant elements of urban landscape transformation. We studied patterns of. natural regeneration in Pozna city. Its spread was limited by distance from propagule source and microhabitats. Revealing patterns of spread allows prediction of which areas require monitoring. Knowledge of. natural regeneration will increase management efficiency.
1718,Understanding the spatial patterns of plant diversity in urban areas is essential for urban planners and managers to effectively manage urban forests . However thus far in many cities plant diversity spatial patterns have been limited at an urban scale by sparse and scattered survey data . This study uses these scattered data in the builtup area of Beijing as a case study to provide a new perspective for exploring the distribution patterns of urban plant diversity . The urban diversity pattern of forest woody plants in this area is mapped via Kriging interpolation in ArcGIS which allows the estimation of woody plant diversity in areas that have not previously been investigated based on a large amount of field survey data . The results clearly indicate the high and lowvalue areas of species diversity within the city This help in deciding priorities for future protection and management at an urban scale . The geographical detector model is then applied to provide a better understanding of the correlation between urbanization characteristics and woody plant diversity spatial patterns . The results will aid in the development and implementation of suitable policies to change uneven distribution patterns in urban areas . Our applied methodology and results can also be employed to improve basic information on urban woody plant diversity and to offer insights on urban green space planning and management .,Geostatistical techniques Kriging interpolation provides a new perspective for studying the plant diversity spatial patterns in urban areas.

The interviews explored challenges around the role of CCS in regional just transitions or how to make the transformation of regions relying on carbon intensive industries to a low carbon society fair . While significant differences in responses between the Aberdeen area the Rijnmond area and Norway were found a common understanding showed that for CCS to contribute to a just transition it has to make a contribution to climate change imperatives help to mitigate the economic and employment effects arising from declining or maturing industries and be undertaken in a manner that helps to redress uneven vulnerabilities and inequalities in society . Five key themes that characterise the opportunities and challenges for CCS from a just transition perspective were drawn from the interviews Skills for a just transition transition as an opportunity responsibility scale of action and viability . We recommend that these are added to earlier work on barriers and enablers of CCS in areas relying on fossil industry .,Just transition is increasingly seen as a frame for the energy transition in regions that rely on carbon intensive industry.

1743,Oxy combustion typically consists of burning coal with a combination of oxygen and a large amount of recycled flue gas to obtain a similar heat flux profile to that of air fired systems . As the cost of electricity from first generation oxy combustion is relatively high several new oxy combustion process concepts have been proposed in recent years and within these the proposed amount of flue gas recycle has varied from near zero to 80 . To better understand the fundamental impact of FGR on the efficiency of oxy combustion systems a thermodynamic approach is used herein . Second law losses associated with flue gas recycle are found to be significant and highly non linear with recycle ratio . A difference in efficiency of up to 10 points can be realized with a maximum efficiency occurring at zero FGR . Furthermore due to the non linear relation of plant efficiency with recycle ratio processes with low recycle experience only a small efficiency penalty compared to no recycle . Additionally fan power requirements also scale non linearly with recycle ratio resulting in significantly lower FGR fan power requirements for low recycle processes as well . These results suggest that for systems employing cold recycle FGR should be kept below 33 .,Effect of flue gas recycle on the efficiency of an oxy combustion plant is explained. Exergy losses are a significantly greater contributor than fan power consumption. Net plant efficiency non linearly dependent on recycle ratio. Knee in the efficiency vs. recycle ratio exists at approx. 33 recycle. Low recycle is almost as efficient as zero recycle may work better in practice.

The capture plant at Niederaussem shows lower solvent consumption and emissions in comparison to other testing facilities which are also part of the ALIGN CCUS project pilot rig at Tiller PACT facilities at Sheffield .

The estimate is from a bottom up perspective including computing carbon emission factors for 22 coal fired power technologies based on the operation data of 47.8 of all units measuring provincial technology structures based on the information data of 99.7 of all ones and weighted calculating the above two terms . We also analyzed the carbon reduction potential of the coal fired power industry according to relevant measures by province . The estimate shows great differences in carbon emission factors of various technologies . The coupling of these factors with different technology structures causes significant variations of 0.9331.019kg CO,The information data of 99.7 and operation data of 47.8 of all coal fired power units in China are investigated. Carbon emission factors of 22 coal fired power technologies and technology structures of 30 provinces is considered. High resolution carbon emissions from the coal fired power industry at the province level are estimated. The carbon reduction potential caused by technology structure optimization and energy conservation is analyzed.
1767,The FluidBed model in Aspen Plus v10 is applied to simulate Calcium looping for production of hydrogen rich product gas from a bubbling fluidized bed carbonator of a dual fluidized bed reactor . The predictions are compared with experimental results from a steady state 20 kW,Enhancement of tar free biomass syngas was studied in a calcium looping operation. Aspen plus built in fluidized bed Fluidbed kinetic model was used. Ca looping enhanced syngas H2 composition from 51.4 to 80vol dry. The effects of carbonator temperature space time and Ca looping ratio were studied. Simulations compare well with experimental data from a 20 kWth pilot plant.
1768,The removal of nitrogen oxides under a high pressure has been widely accepted as an effective method for the treatment of oxy fuel combustion flue gas . The high pressure promotes the oxidation of NO to NO,Multiparameter optimization was proposed in modeling nitrogen oxides absorption. Nitrogen mass balance based on measurements was achieved with a relative error8 . Five pressure dependent critical parameters of the modeling were investigated.
1769,Monitoring and Verification was reviewed in this journal in 2015 as part of the Special Issue to mark the tenth anniversary of the IPCC report on CCS . This article provides an update focusing on identifying areas where there has been technical progress . Activity in CCS has continued since 2015 but the shift towards commercial utilization has altered the context for M V. Published field experimentation and verification with monitoring methods has not progressed as much as was hoped . While much high quality theoretical work has continued especially in the area of the design of monitoring systems an imbalance is apparent . One area where field tests have continued and progress has been marked is the rapid development of distributed acoustic sensing and its pairing with permanent seismic sources . Progress here has the potential to make seismic monitoring cheaper and less intrusive . Interesting proposals have been made for monitoring with pressure data but most have not been tested . Methods of monitoring in the marine ecosystem are rapidly being adapted to the requirements of M V. These methods are well adapted to the quantification of leakage that is mandated in some jurisdictions . Overall the need for testing the numerous good ideas in field experiments is very apparent .,Progress in M V since 2015 is reviewed. High quality theoretical work has continued. Rapid development of distributed acoustic sensing. Monitoring in the marine ecosystem being adapted to the requirements of M V. Need for more testing in field experiments.
1770,Carbon Capture and Storage is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels without releasing the CO,This paper distils the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CO. storage. Technologies for detection location and quantification of potential leakage from offshore CCS projects. Each project used controlled releases in representative marine environments to verify technology performance and environmental impact. Impacts of small to medium CO. leakages from large scale storage have been assessed to be limited and localised. Integrated marine monitoring systems can detect even small leakages of 1050 L min at unknown locations in a large area of interest.
1771,CCS is expected to play a sizeable role over the next several decades to drastically abate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy system by 2050 . With the integrated assessment model TIAM ECN we project how large its contribution could be in Europe in the power sector and industry and analyze how this contribution may be affected by cost decline and ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets . If Europe stays on track of achieving zero net emissions by mid century we find that CO,Under 2 C policy we find that CO. capture in Europe may grow to some 1700 MtCO. yr in 2050. CCS applied to natural gas and biomass could then account for 25 of electricity generation. Natural gas with CCS could contribute over 35 of energy use in industry. Strict climate policy is a bigger driver of broad CCS diffusion than technology cost reductions. A 30 CCS capital cost reduction could yield about 17 billion US yr energy system cost savings.
1772,The accumulation of heat stable salts in the gas sweetening amine units causes several problems including foaming corrosion and fouling . Herein a simple and efficient electromagnetic salt removal process was proposed for the separation of HSS from industrial lean amine solution . In this process HSS were separated through an electro polarization mechanism instead of electrosorption . For this purpose a lab scale concentric flow setup was fabricated using aluminum conduit and rod as an anode and cathode respectively . The effects of the process operational parameters including flow rate applied voltage residence time and pH were investigated . At the best operating conditions a maximum of 15 HSS removal percentage was achieved in one pass having the power consumption of 0.003 Wh L. This study demonstrated the potential usage of EMSR for industrial applications .,A unique electromagnetic process was designed and tested for the removal of HSS from industrial lean amine. HSS removal depends on the applied voltage feed flowrate and electromagnetic forces. Electromagnetic salt removal EMSR process exhibited higher separation efficiency. EMSR is a cost effective and energy efficient compared to electrodialysis.
1773,Carbon Capture and Sequestration technology to slow global warming is a challenge to be solved worldwide . In this study a dual circulating fluidized bed process using a solid sorbent was developed for the post combustion CO,Dual circulating fluidized bed process using an amine solid sorbent for CO2 capture. 20 Nm3 hr bench scale facility equipped with indirect solid solid heat exchanger. 80 CO2 capture efficiency and 4.5 wt sorption working capacity. Validation of process long term stability and sensitivity on operating condition. Heat transfer efficiency of 10.5 W m. K in indirect solid heat exchanger.
1774,Carbon capture and storage is indispensable in achieving the well below 2 C warming target especially for China with coal dominated energy structures . However high investment makes the development of CCS far from the global warming target . Concerns about the high cost have led to a spread of pessimistic attitude towards the future of CCS to some extent . Therefore this study provides the first instance to determine the unit CO,The study quantifies component based learning curves of four CCS pathways. A nonlinear programming approach of CCS technology selection was developed. An empirical analysis of Chinas power sector was carried out. Advanced CCS technology roadmaps in line with 2 C target were put forward.
1775,Regulatory oversight of a geologic carbon sequestration project relies on iterative estimations throughout the project lifetime of the area where increased risks to underground sources of drinking water may occur due to injection of CO,Uncertainty in reservoir and aquifer characteristics yields a probabilistic risk based Area of Review. AoR is determined based on the probability of aquifer impacts rather than just on leakage from an open conduit. The workflow is demonstrated using characterization and modeling data from a permitted carbon storage project.
1776,How would high angle normal faults be reactivated under a present day strike slip tectonic regime if reservoir pore pressure increased during injection operations What parameters would control shear slip localization To answer these questions 3D one way coupled reservoir geomechanical modeling of potential fault reactivation in the St. Lawrence Platform Quebec is performed . We evaluate the risk of shear failure along the pre existing subsurface Yamaska high angle normal fault under the present day strike slip tectonic regime . Slip may be generated by pressure perturbations in deep saline aquifers of the Early Paleozoic sedimentary basin this has implications for the assessment of risks associated with CO,Strike slip slip reactivation of a high angle normal fault caused by fluid injection. Reservoir pore pressure buildup 8 MPa results in dextral slip along a normal fault. The non planar fault geometry and the rock properties determine stress localization. Plastic shear strain is localized on optimally oriented fault segments. 3D reservoir geomechanical modeling helps quantify the risk of fault reactivation.
1777,If carbon capture and storage needs to be deployed at basin or larger scale it is likely that multiple sites will be injecting carbon dioxide CO,A strategy to overcome pressure limitations by simply deploying more CO. injection wells could be very costly and exhibit diminishing returns. Brine production could be necessary to sequester 20 or more of the annual CO. emissions of major stationary sources in the region at lowest cost. If onsite disposal of brine without repressurizing the storage reservoir is feasible brine production could possibly reduce net storage cost. Data on the geologic heterogeneity within the storage reservoir allowed identification of a high injectivity zone CO. storage sweet spot . With or without brine production the lowest cost option found in this study was to sequester CO. exclusively in the storage sweet spot.
1778,Recent studies have shown that underground natural gas storage leaks can be indirectly detected through the spectral changes of surface vegetation . However due to the phenomenon of different samples demonstrating the same spectrum using a spectral based approach may result in misdetection . Vegetation stressed by natural gas leakage has unique spatial patterns . Therefore a field experiment of natural gas leakage vegetation stress was carried out . Hyperspectral images of bean corn crops and grasslands were obtained which led to a proposed new spectral spatial based methodology to detect natural gas leaks and areas of vegetation stress . First the vegetation indices and the color index were extracted then respectively segmented using the Otsu and the proposed threshold segmentation methods . Next the shape parameters of the posture ratio and rectangularity of the segmented objects were used to construct a circular detection model . The accuracies of the detection results based on the vegetation indices and color index were 53 and 56 respectively . Finally based on the concentric ring spatial distribution pattern of the stress zones the two types of detection results were fused using the linearly weighted fusion method after which all the leakage points were accurately detected and localized without any false alarms .,A spectral spatial based methodology for natural gas leakage detection is proposed. Natural gas stressed vegetation showed unique spatial patterns as concentric circular ring. Combing spectral and spatial features can get better detection accuracy than using only spectral feature.
1779,The capture and subsurface storage of carbon dioxide is a sustainable option that is currently pursued worldwide to mitigate greenhouse gas effect . However predicting the long term mechanical integrity of CO,The main fluid rock reactions for Mt. Simon rock are feldspar and quartz dissolution. Incubation in CO. saturated brine leads to an increase in nano and microporosity. Due to CO. induced reactions the macroscopic creep modulus decreases. Computer vision provides a means to monitor CO. related mineralogical changes. Grid nano indentation yields a deeper understanding of CO. induced geochemical reactions.
1780,Cross bedding is a prominent sedimentary structure commonly found in fluvial and coastal to shallow marine sedimentary sequences which are often considered for the geological CO,Cross bedded sedimentary structures are prominent features of CO. storage reservoirs. Turning point saturation is important to determine the amount of capillary trapping. Range of turning point saturation for rock properties in cross bedding is determined.
1781,In addition to the sharp growth of unconventional natural gas wells in the past decade there are few hundred thousands of abandoned and orphaned wells across the world potentially contributing to gas emissions . Failure in the barrier and sealing capabilities of the cement and casing are of factors playing role in these leakages . Squeeze job as a remedial treatment is performed to place cement slurry from the surface to the target points to seal narrow spaces behind the casing and or perforations placed in the casing . In this study a novel additive for the squeeze cement is proposed by introducing surface modified graphite nanoplatelets to carefully adjust rheology and mechanical properties of the prepared cement slurry to remediate some flaws in pre existing cement sheaths . We seek for better penetration into narrow spaces behind the casing with appropriate thickening time low fluid loss and high final strengths . The process of surface modification is very important to generate a homogeneous cement composite with superior mechanical properties . We develop a chemical method for the surface treatment of GNPs to alter their intrinsically hydrophobic properties to hydrophilic making them compatible with the aqueous medium of cement . Details of surface modification approach and the concentration of surface modified nanoparticles are tailored to achieve a desirable slurry for squeeze treatments following API RP 10B 2 procedures . We believe that these nanoparticles due to their 2D nanostructure not only improve cement movability but also provide appropriate sealing in the target zones . To assess the performance of the prepared cement slurry to effectively seal narrow targets narrow slot tests with 120 microns thickness are conducted to show the supremacy of the proposed solution in sealing narrow spots . We also investigate the effect of adding a commercial superplasticizer on the properties of nanoengineered cement slurry to better resemble field practices . Results show that the presence of surface modified GNPs provide cement slurry with low rheological properties zero free fluid low fluid loss and deep penetration which are promising for future field trials .,Wellbore integrity is considered is one of the major sources of methane emission into atmosphere. There are few millions of abandoned wells around the world with leakage problems. We proposed a novel nanoengineered cement slurry to address the well leakage problem. The proposed cement solution is sealing the wells with superior pumpability mechanical strength and penetration properties.
1782,There is a growing emphasis on the speed of diagnosis as an aspect of cancer prognosis . While epidemiological data in the last decade have quantified diagnostic timeliness and its variation whether and how often prolonged diagnostic intervals can be considered avoidable is unknown . We used data from the English National Cancer Diagnosis Audit on 17 042 patients diagnosed with cancer in 2014 . Participating primary care physicians were asked to identify delays in diagnosis that they deemed avoidable together with the setting of the avoidable delay and key attributable factors . We used descriptive analysis and regression frameworks to assess validity and examine variation in the frequency and nature of avoidable delays . Among 14 259 patients 24 were deemed to have had an avoidable delay to their diagnosis . Patients with a reported avoidable delay had a longer median diagnostic interval than those without . Of all avoidable delays 13 were deemed to have occurred pre consultation 49 within primary care and 38 within secondary care . Avoidable delays were mostly attributed to the test request performance phase . Multimorbidity was associated with greater odds of avoidable delay with heterogeneous associations with cancer site . We have shown that GP identified instances of avoidable delay have construct validity . Whilst the causes of avoidable diagnostic delays are multi factorial and occur in different settings and phases of the diagnostic process their analysis can guide improvement initiatives and enable the examination of any prognostic implications .,A quarter of patients had a GP assessed avoidable delay to their diagnosis. The diagnostic interval was 2 months longer for patients with an avoidable delay. Avoidable delay was more likely in patients with multimorbidity and certain cancers.
1783,This study compares the side effects of active surveillance prostatectomy radiation with or without adjuvant endocrine therapy watchful waiting and palliative therapy on patient reported outcomes in a nationwide population based cohort of Danish men with prostate cancer . A total of 15 465 participants completed questionnaires over a 5year period . Condition specific quality of life focusing on urinary function bowel incontinence sexual function and hormonal symptoms were investigated using the validated EPIC 26 questionnaire at diagnosis 1 year and 3 year follow up . Patients were identified from the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry with data linked to several national healthcare registries . Longitudinal analysis with linear mixed effects models were fitted to compare changes over time on quality of life symptom scores for five treatment modalities adjusting for age clinical TNM stage PSA value Gleason score Charlson Comorbidity score education disposable income and urbanization measured at time of prostate cancer diagnosis . There was a more than10 point decrease in mean scores across all symptom domains at 1 year follow up . Thereafter mean scores for all symptom domains improved marginally and remained relatively unchanged at 3 year follow up . Prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary incontinence . Overall quality of life was most adversely affected by sexual function regardless of treatment modality . Clinical interventions for improving symptoms should focus particularly on the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis . Greater emphasis on improving sexual function should be practiced in clinical and rehabilitative care since this area has the single greatest impact on symptom specific QoL after primary treatment for prostate cancer .,We investigated treatment side effects on patient reported outcomes in a cohort of Danish men diagnosed with prostate cancer over a 5 year period. Overall quality of life was most adversely affected by sexual function regardless of treatment modality. Prostatectomy resulted in the greatest decline in sexual function scores in the short term follow up. Our findings suggest that clinical interventions for improving symptoms should focus on the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis.
1784,Preventable risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia remain largely unknown . The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between adherence to nutrition based guidelines for cancer prevention and CLL in the MCC Spain casecontrol study . A total of 318 CLL cases and 1293 population based controls were included in the present study . The World Cancer Research Fund American Institute for Cancer Research score based on the 2018 recommendations for cancer prevention was constructed . We used logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders . Individuals in the highest tertile of the WCRF AICR score had an odds ratio for CLL of 1.25 compared with individuals with low adherence . Each point increment in the score was associated with an OR for CLL of 1.06 . Analyses by severity of disease did not show significant heterogeneity of effects . Overall our results do not support an association between the WCRF AICR score and CLL yet we might have been limited by statistical power and study design to detect modest associations . Further research ideally with a prospective design long follow up and including additional lymphoma subtypes is warranted to confirm the impact of composite healthy lifestyle behaviors on lymphoma risk .,The 2018 WCRF AICR guidelines were examined in relation to chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . 318 CLL cases and 1293 controls from the MCC Spain study were included. Adherence to the 2018 WCRF AICR recommendations was not associated with CLL.
1785,To evaluate the risk factors associated with pre neoplastic lesions and gastric cancer in countries with different cancer risk in Latin America . 1222 questionnaires of risk factors related to pre neoplastic lesions and gastric cancer were obtained from patients from Mexico Colombia and Paraguay who were treated at the gastroenterology or oncology service of participant hospitals . In addition biopsies specimens to establish histological diagnosis and blood to detect IgG antibodies against Seropositivity to The present study in Latin American countries confirmed that similar environmental factors such as smoking and grain cereal consumption were associated with,Gastric cancer remains the leading cause of infection related cancer in 2018. 1222 patients with various gastric pathology were recruited in Latin American. Seropositivity to. was associated with risk of pre neoplastic lesions. Grain cereal intake and egg intake were related to gastric cancer. Cigarette smoking was associated with risk of being infected by
1786,There are conflicting reports on the association of vasectomy and the risk of prostate cancer . Our objective was to evaluate the association between vasectomy and PCa from a nationwide cohort in Finland . Sterilization registry of Finland and the Finnish Cancer Registry data were utilized to identify all men who underwent vasectomy between years 19872014 in Finland . Standard incidence ratio for PCa as well as all cause standardized mortality ratios were calculated . We identified 38 124 men with vasectomy with a total of 429 937 person years follow up data . The median age at vasectomy was 39.7 years 35.944.0 after vasectomy PCa was diagnosed in 413 men . SIR for PCa for the vasectomy cohort was 1.15 . By the end of follow up 19 men had died from PCa while the expected number was 20.5 . The overall mortality was decreased among men with vasectomy . We found a small statistically significant increase in PCa incidence after vasectomy but in contrast the mortality of vasectomized men was significantly reduced . This may be due to higher likelihood of vasectomized men to undergo prostate specific antigen testing having healthier general lifestyle and other biological factors e.g . high reproductive fitness .,Incidence of prostate cancer is increased after vasectomy. Incidence of prostate cancer increases during the first ten years after vasectomy. Men with history of vasectomy had nearly 50 decreased risk for overall mortality.
1787,Central nervous system malignancy is the commonest cause of cancer death in children and adolescents in high income settings . There is limited data on survival inequalities by race ethnicity and socioeconomic position for young patients we aim to analyse their influence on survival from childhood CNS tumour . 9577 children and adolescents diagnosed with primary malignant CNS tumours during 20002015 followed up until Dec 31st 2015 and reported to cancer registries were included in the analysis . Cox regression models estimated the hazard ratios for race ethnicity SEP and individual insurance status adjusting for sex age diagnostic period and tumour type . Individual level insurance status data were available from 2007 . 62.5 children and adolescents were non Hispanic White 10.6 were non Hispanic Black and 26.9 were Hispanic . Race ethnicity was strongly associated with survival even after adjusting for SEP with Black and Hispanic children having higher hazards of death than White children . This association remained after adjusting for insurance status . There was an apparent positive association between SEP and survival that was largely attenuated after adjustment for insurance status . Survival was comparable between those privately and Medicaid insured . Non Hispanic Black and Hispanic children had lower survival than their White counterparts . This association not fully explained by differences in SEP tumour subtype or health insurance could be related to racially ethnically driven barriers to optimal healthcare warranting further investigation .,Central nervous system malignancy is the commonest cause of childhood cancer death in a high income setting. Hispanic and non Hispanic Black children had significantly lower survival than White children even after accounting for socioeconomic position. Children living in lower socio economic areas tended to have lower survival than those in higher socio economic areas. However after accounting for race ethnicity and insurance status SEP was not significantly associated with death hazard. Individual insurance status was not associated with survival.
1788,Delivering health care timely and geographically accessible are determining factors for the prognosis of children with cancer . This study analyzed geographic access and timeliness to diagnostic services in Colombia . In this Colombian national childhood cancer database based study patients and their diagnostic facilities were individually and separately space positioned . Distances between the household to the diagnostic facility and between the clinical date of suspicion and diagnosis were determined . 27 of the sample of 731 patients had access to diagnostic centres in less than 30min . The travel distance to diagnostic centres was lowest in the Caribe and Andina Regions . However in Amazona and Orinoqua Regions 87 and 81 had to travel more than 90 km representing very long travel times . For more than 23 of patients time to diagnosis was more than 90 days in Orinoqua this was above 90 days for 1 3 of patients . Despite relatively short travel distances in the Caribe Region for 61 time to diagnosis exceeded 30 days . This study identified clear shortcomings in the Colombian Health System related to the quality of childhood cancer related health care in terms of timeliness cancer networks and geographic access . These inequities not only depend on sociodemographic characteristics and should be intervened upon .,Less than 50 of Colombian childhood cancer cases were diagnosed within 30 days. Travel distances are long many childhood cancer cases travel from other departments. Despite universal health insurance diagnostic and treatment opportunities show disparities. Cancer care networks are as vital as communication between providers and insurers.
1789,We aimed to examine the association between acute pancreatitis a potential early symptom of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic cancer stage treatment and prognosis . We conducted a cohort study of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during 20042017 using population based registry data from Denmark and Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data linked with Medicare claims from the United States which include individuals aged 65 . We ascertained information on acute pancreatitis diagnoses up to 90 days before pancreatic cancer and followed them for a maximum of five years . We assessed overall survival difference at 30 days six months and one three and five years comparing patients with and without coexistence of acute pancreatitis . Secondary outcomes were cancer stage and treatment . We identified 12 522 Danish and 37 552 US patients with pancreatic cancer . In the Danish cohort 1.4 had acute pancreatitis before pancreatic cancer vs. 5.9 in the US cohort . After five years of follow up the survival difference was 6.1 in Danish and 1.7 in US patients comparing patients with and without acute pancreatitis . Patients with acute pancreatitis had lower prevalence of metastatic tumors at diagnosis and higher resection frequencies than patients without acute pancreatitis . Pancreatic cancer patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed up to 90 days before cancer diagnosis had earlier stage at diagnosis and better survival than patients without acute pancreatitis .,Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and timely diagnosis is impeded by the lack of early symptoms. Acute pancreatitis may be an early symptom of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer patients presenting with acute pancreatitis have an improve prognosis. The findings are likely attributed to lower tumor stage and higher resection frequencies. This study highlights the importance of early detection of pancreatic cancer in patients with acute pancreatitis.
1790,Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast is considered to be a non obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer . This suggests that risk factors for DCIS should be a subset of those for IBC . To this end we investigated whether demographic lifestyle and reproductive factors that have been linked to IBC risk are also associated with DCIS risk . This study was conducted in 263 788 women aged 4069 years at enrolment into the UK Biobank population based cohort . Information on demographic reproductive and health factors was collected at baseline using computerized questionnaires while incident DCIS was ascertained through linkage to UK cancer registries . Age adjusted and multivariable hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models in the total sample and by menopausal status . During an average of 7 years of follow up 1 016 women developed DCIS . Multivariable analysis indicated that age physical activity height family history of breast cancer menopausal status parity and years between menarche and first live birth had associations with DCIS risk . Among post menopausal women not using hormone replacement therapy body mass index 30kg m,Anthropometric and reproductive risk factors for invasive breast cancer have been associated with risk of ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS of the breast. No prospective study has evaluated the association of these factors with risk of DCIS in both pre and post menopausal women. Using the UK Biobank data we confirmed some of the DCIS risk factors previously reported by other studies. We report for the first time that height and body mass index BMI among post menopausal women are associated with increased DCIS risk. These findings suggest that BMI is potentially involved in breast tumorigenic development at an earlier stage than previously proposed.
1791,Since the number of cancer survivors is increasing it is imperative that we better understand the long term consequences of these survivors . We assessed the risk of developing a second primary malignant neoplasm after an index potentially HPV associated cancers . We constructed a population based cohort of patients with P HPV AC using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry data . We limited patients to those with invasive P HPV AC based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3rd edition . Excess SPMN risks were calculated based on standardized incidence ratios and excess absolute risks per 10 000 person years at risk . A total of 105 644 patients with an index P HPV AC were identified and 7.8 developed a SPMN . In all P HPV AC patients the overall SIR was 1.73 and EAR of 70.72 per 10 000 PYR . All index P HPV AC sites showed statistically significant increases in the risk of SPMN except for anal cancer among men compared with the general population . The greatest increase in risk of SPMN was observed among patients diagnosed with an index P HPV oropharyngeal cancer . Men developed SPMN mostly in aero digestive tract whiles women developed SPMN both in aero digestive tract and other HPV associated cancer sites . P HPV AC survivors experienced excess risk of SPMN . These findings have the potential to affect future surveillance practices and improve preventive healthcare for survivors of P HPV ACs .,Quantified the risks and burden of SPMN among survivors of potential HPV associated cancers. The risk and burden of SPMN was high overall. 1 in 12 survivors of potentially HPV associated cancers developed SPMN. SPMNs were predominantly in the aero digestive tract and other HPV associated sites. Finding calls for strategies that prevent or detect SPMN early in cancer survivors.
1792,Population based cancer registries collect information on first course of treatment that may be utilized in research on cancer care quality yet few studies have investigated the validity of this information . We examined the accuracy and completeness of registry based treatment information in a cohort of adolescent and young adult women . Women diagnosed with breast cancer lymphoma thyroid cancer cervical uterine cancer or ovarian cancer at ages 1539 during 20032014 were identified using data from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry . CCR data were linked to Medicaid and private insurance claims data and claims were reviewed for the 12 months following diagnosis to identify cancer treatments received . Using claims data as the gold standard we calculated the sensitivity and positive predictive value of CCR data for receipt of chemotherapy radiation and hormone therapy . We also compared dates of treatment initiation between the two data sources . For all cancer types combined the sensitivity of the CCR data was high for chemotherapy and moderate for radiation . PPVs were 82 and 83 for chemotherapy and radiation respectively . Both the sensitivity and PPV were lower for hormone therapy for breast cancer . For all three treatment types dates of initiation in the registry and the claims differed by 30 days for most women . In this cohort of young women population based cancer registry data on chemotherapy receipt was reasonably accurate and complete in comparison with insurance claims . Radiation and hormone therapy appeared to be less complete .,Cancer registry data on chemotherapy was fairly complete compared to claims data. Radiation and hormone therapy information in the registry appeared less complete. Our findings support using registry based chemotherapy information in research.
1793,Cancer recurrence is a meaningful patient outcome that is not captured in population based cancer surveillance . This project supported National Program of Cancer Registries central cancer registries in five U.S. states to determine the disease course of all breast and colorectal cancer cases . The aims were to assess the feasibility of capturing disease free status and subsequent cancer outcomes and to explore analytic approaches for future studies . Data were obtained on 11 769 breast and 6033 colorectal cancer cancers diagnosed in 2011 . Registry trained abstractors reviewed medical records from multiple sources for up to 60 months to determine documented DF status recurrence progression and residual disease . We described the occurrence of these patient centered outcomes along with analytic considerations when determining time to event outcomes and recurrence free survival . Disease free status was determined on all but 3.8 of cancer cases . Among 14 458 cases that became DF 6.1 of breast and 13.0 of colorectal cancer cases had a documented recurrence . Recurrence free survival varied by stage for stage II III cancers at 48 months 83.2 of female breast and 69.2 of colorectal cancer patients were alive without recurrence . The ability to distinguish between progression and residual disease among never disease free patients limited our ability to examine progression as an outcome . This study demonstrated that population based registries given intense support and resources can capture recurrence and offer a generalizable picture of cancer outcomes . Further work on refining definitions sampling strategies and novel approaches to capture recurrence could advance the ability of a national cancer surveillance system to contribute to patient centered outcomes research .,Standards for defining cancer recurrence do not exist and data are limited. Disease free recurrence data collection feasible but costly and in need of data standards. We show an approach to estimate population based cancer recurrence and recurrence free survival. If never disease free capture of progression was elusive but less critical due to poor survival.
1794,Important social disparities in colorectal screening exist in Canada . Few studies have assessed disparities further along the cancer control continuum . Here we assess the associations between social and material deprivation physician density rural residence and the absence of provincial mail based screening programs and colorectal cancer stage at diagnosis . Colorectal cancer cases and stage data were obtained through the Canadian Cancer Registry . Cases were linked to 2006 Canadian Census Dissemination Area level data on rural urban status exposure to a provincial mail based screening program and social and material deprivation and to Scotts Medical Database 2011 physician density data . Age sex and predictor adjusted Generalized estimating equation Poisson models were used to determine independent associations between predictors and late stage at diagnosis . Half of CRC cases are diagnosed at stage III or IV with younger age groups experiencing higher late stage prevalence . The covariate adjusted late stage prevalence was 2 percentage points higher in most materially and socially deprived areas and in provinces with no mail based screening programs . No significant differences were observed according to rural residence or physician density . Social disparities in late stage CRC diagnosis are modest . Continued surveillance of these disparities may be warranted as provinces continue to promote early cancer detection through screening and stage distributions may change overtime .,Half of colorectal cancer cases in Canada are diagnosed at stage III or IV. Younger age is associated with later stage at diagnosis. Late stage prevalence is slightly higher in more socially deprived areas. Late stage prevalence is slightly higher in more materially deprived areas. Opportunistic settings vs mail based programs are associated with later diagnosis.
1795,There has been a rapid increase in colorectal cancer cases in Asian countries including Malaysia . CRC is usually diagnosed at a late stage and early detection of CRC is vital in improving survival . This study was conducted to determine the uptake rate of the immunochemical faecal occult blood test the response rate to colonoscopy and the CRC detection rate . We also wanted to identify the association between colorectal neoplasia and the Asia Pacific Colorectal Cancer Screening scoring system . We recruited 2264 individuals from The Malaysian Cohort participants aged 3565 years who consented to colorectal screening using the iFOBT kit from July 2017 until January 2019 . The response rate and positive iFOBT test rate of this study were 79.6 and 13.1 respectively . Among those with positive results 125 individuals underwent colonoscopy CRC was detected in six of them while 45 others had polyps . The overall CRC detection rate was 0.3 while the colorectal neoplasia detection rate was 2.3 . The APCS scoring indicated a significant association with colorectal neoplasia risk with increasing trend by severity from moderate to high risk compared to low risk . Most of the participants who were positive for iFOBT were those at high risk . The awareness of CRC risk and iFOBT screening are important strategies for early detection of CRC . We showed a CRC detection rate of 0.3 among those who volunteered to have the iFOBT screening .,IFOBT is a suitable screening tool with detection rate higher than in previous studies. People who were aware of their risk were more inclined to be screened. High neoplasia detection served in early prevention of CRC.
1796,Androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay treatment for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer . However potential effects of ADT treatment on neurocognitive dysfunction remain unclear . The present study was conducted to assess the relation between ADT treatment and risk of cognitive decline in Asian men with PC . A population based cohort of 24 464 men with PC each newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 was selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database . Subjects were further grouped by treatment as non ADT or ADT members of the latter subjected to bilateral orchiectomy or medical treatment . A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with ADT as time dependent covariate was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios of subsequent cognitive decline including dementia Alzheimer s disease and Parkinsons disease . ADT showed a significant association with overall risk of cognitive decline especially for PD dementia and non Alzheimer dementia . When stratified by various ADT regimens antiandrogen only recipients displayed significantly heightened risks of subsequent AD non AZD and PD . However combined androgen blockade also imposed an increased risk of PD . There was no apparent correlation between duration of ADT exposure and cognitive dysfunction . Various ADT therapies may have disparate impacts on cognitive function . Prospective studies exploring pertinent clinical characteristics more fully are needed to confirm these findings .,There was a significant association between ADT and the risks of cognitive decline. ADT users receiving anti androgen alone significantly increased with subsequent risks of AD non AZD and PD. An increased risk of PD was also observed in combined androgen blockade group.
1797,To evaluate whether anti diabetic medications are related to colorectal cancer risk in type 2 diabetes patients . The study was performed from a population based prospective cohort provided by the National Health Insurance Corporation . Among the 2 084 602 patients newly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes in this period the cases had incident CRC identified at least 3 years after the diagnosis and the controls were matched to each case by age sex body mass index fasting plasma glucose level and year of the diagnosis . Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio and its 95 confidence intervals for CRC by anti diabetic medications . A total of 4 228 cases were identified and 4 228 controls were matched to the cases . Sulfonylurea use increased the risk for CRC 1.14 showing an increasing trend with increasing cumulative doses Our results suggest that sulfonylureas except for gliclazide increase the CRC risk in type 2 diabetic patients . Long term follow up studies are necessary to clarify the association of newer anti diabetic medications with the CRC incidence .,Most of the anti diabetic medications may have neutral effect on the colorectal cancer incidence among the patients with type 2 diabetes. However sulfonylurea drugs except for gliclazide increase the risk for colorectal cancer in these patients. It is inconclusive whether thiazolidinedione and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can modify the risk for colorectal cancer. Long term follow up studies are necessary to clarify the effect of newer anti diabetic drugs on colorectal cancer risk.
1798,The principal target age for Australian BreastScreen services was 5069 years in 19912013 and 5074 years from 2014 . History of BreastScreen NSW screening participation of NSW women diagnosed with breast cancer in 20052014 was examined using linked BreastScreen and Cancer Registry data . Differences in BreastScreen participation were investigated by sociodemographic and tumour characteristics and diagnostic period using the Pearson Chi square test or Fishers Exact test when numbers were small and by multivariate logistic regression . At breast cancer diagnosis a history of BreastScreen participation varied by age from 23 for 4049years to 68 for 5059 years 72 for 7074 years and 78 for 6069 years . Among women experiencing breast cancer at age 5069 years 60 had participated in BreastScreen 24 months of diagnosis . Higher odds of BreastScreen participation applied to residents of inner regional and remote compared with major city areas and for women with localized compared with more distant cancer spread . BreastScreen participation was lower in Indigenous than non Indigenous women . Differences in participation existed by country of birth and residential location but they were not pronounced . The history of BreastScreen NSW participation of 60 24 months for women aged 5069 years at breast cancer diagnosis is less than the 70 target for biennial screening coverage at a population level but this target has never been reached by an Australian jurisdiction . Qualitative research of screening barriers and opportunities may provide a useful guide for reducing barriers across the population .,Breast screening is directed at finding breast cancers earlier. For women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 5069 years. 73 had a history of screening. 60 have been screened in the 24 months before diagnosis. Screening coverage in the 24 months before diagnosis did not vary by socioeconomic status of residential area. A history of breast screening is less frequent in Indigenous than non Indigenous women with breast cancer.
1799,Analyze cervical and breast cancer mortality in Brazil and its relationship with socioeconomic population indicators and availability of health services in the period 20112015 . An ecological study is presented herein . Mortality data were extracted from the Mortality Information System based on ICD 10 per area of residence and age group for the period 20112015 . Socioeconomic variables were extracted from the Brazilian Human Development Atlas and the National Register of Health Facilities provided data on the density of physicians and health services . Statistical analysis was carried out using the Chi squared test and Poisson regression with robust variance and 95 confidence level . The median age standardized mortality rates for cervical and breast cancers were respectively 5.95 and 10.65 per 100 000 women . High cervical cancer mortality rates presented a statistically significant association with GINI Index The importance of organization and equity in the access to health services is highlighted herein enabling the reorientation of public policies aimed at the minimization of health disparities .,Cervical cancer mortality is higher in regions with higher rates of social inequality. Cervical cancer death is higher in regions with lower levels of human development. Breast cancer mortality is higher in areas with higher density of general doctors.
1800,Using data from the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine we analyzed recent trends in incidence rates and used these to predict the future cancer incidence burden up to 2022 . All cancer cases for the years 20032012 were retrieved from the NCRUs database and laryngeal and lung cancers . Assuming these trends will continue lung cancer will remain the most common male cancer in 2022 followed by prostate cancer colorectal cancer and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx . In females the order of the four most common cancers will not change in 2022 compared with 2012 with cervical cancer remaining the fourth most common cancer . We predict an overall increase of 18 in the number of cancer cases in Ukraine to 179 493 cases in 2022 . The anticipated increase in the number of cancer patients in Ukraine clearly has knock on effects on a healthcare system undergoing reforms . Tobacco control appears to be the only functioning aspect of cancer prevention in the country and there is a need for a broader national cancer control plan . The continued monitoring and evaluation of implemented cancer control measures by the NCRU will help prioritize targets and allocate future resources to cancer services .,The incidence rates of the common cancers in Ukraine were increasing during 20032012. We predict an overall 18 increase in the number of cancer cases from 2012 to 2022. While tobacco control has been implemented there is a need for a broader cancer control plan.
1801,While radiotherapy is a major risk factor for thyroid cancer after childhood cancer factors contributing to increased thyroid cancer risk after adulthood cancer remain unclear . We evaluated second primary papillary thyroid cancer risk among 3 175 2161 year adult survivors of non thyroid malignancies from US population based cancer registries using standardized incidence ratios . Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer . SIRs for second primary PTC were statistically significantly 1.23.5 fold elevated overall and after 23 27 first cancer types evaluated with generally similar risks for localized and regional distant PTC . SIRs for regional distant PTC were highest after pancreatic 1.96.5 and soft tissue cancers followed by melanoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma and larynx kidney and brain central nervous system cancers . SIRs typically decreased with increasing latency but remained statistically significantly elevated for regional distant PTC 5 years after diagnosis of cancers of the rectum pancreas lung bronchus soft tissue female breast uterine corpus prostate and kidney and after melanoma Hodgkin lymphoma CLL SLL and follicular lymphoma . Neither total nor regional distant PTC were clearly associated with initial course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy . PTC risk was elevated after a range of first primary adult cancers but was not clearly related to treatment . Although surveillance may contribute to elevated short term risks of PTC longer term elevations in regional distant PTC may be attributable to shared risk factors .,Risks for second primary papillary thyroid cancer PTC were elevated after a broad range of first primary cancer types. Second primary PTC risk generally decreased with latency but remained statistically significantly elevated following a number of first primary types. Risks were generally similar for localized and regional distant second primary PTC.
1802,Progression free survival and tumour response have been investigated as surrogate endpoints for overall survival in advanced colorectal cancer however their validity has been shown to be suboptimal . In recent years meta analytic methods allowing for use of multiple surrogate endpoints jointly have been proposed . Our aim was to assess if PFS and TR used jointly as surrogate endpoints to OS improve their predictive value . Data were obtained from a systematic review of randomised controlled trials investigating effectiveness of pharmacological therapies in aCRC including systemic chemotherapies anti epidermal growth factor receptor therapies and anti angiogenic agents . Multivariate meta analysis was used to model the association patterns between treatment effects on the surrogate endpoints and the final outcome . Analysis of 33 trials reporting treatment effects on all three outcomes showed reasonably strong association between treatment effects on PFS and OS however the association parameters were obtained with a large uncertainty . A weak surrogate relationship was noted between the treatment effects on TR and OS . Modelling the two surrogate endpoints TR and PFS jointly as predictors of treatment effect on OS gave no marked improvement to surrogate association patterns . Modest improvement in the precision of the predicted treatment effects on the final outcome was noted in studies investigating anti angiogenic therapy however it was likely due to chance . The joint use of two surrogate endpoints did not lead to marked improvement in the association between treatment effects on surrogate and final endpoints in advanced colorectal cancer .,Progression free survival is a moderate surrogate for OS in colorectal cancer. Tumour response and PFS are modelled as joint predictors of OS. There was no marked improvement when using two surrogate endpoints jointly.
1803,Recent years have seen increased interest in the role of neighborhood factors in chronic diseases such as cancers . Less is known about the role of neighborhood factors beyond individual demographics such as age or education . It is particularly important to examine neighborhood effects on health among African American men and women considering the disproportionate impact of cancer on this group . This study evaluated the unique contribution of neighborhood characteristics beyond individual demographics to cancer control behaviors in African American men and women . Individual level data were drawn from a national survey . Participants home addresses were geocoded and merged with neighborhood data from the American Community Survey . Multi level regressions examined the unique contribution of neighborhood characteristics beyond individual demographics to a variety of cancer risk prevention and screening behaviors . Neighborhood racial ethnic diversity median income and percentage of home ownership made modest significant contributions beyond individual factors in particular to smoking status where these factors were associated with lower likelihood of smoking . Men living in neighborhoods with older residents and greater income and home ownership were significantly more likely to report prostate specific antigen testing . Regional analyses suggested different neighborhood factors were associated with smoking status depending on the region . Findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the interplay of social determinants of health and neighborhood social environment among African American men and women with implications for cancer control interventions to eliminate cancer disparities .,Neighborhood social environment plays a role in some cancer control behaviors beyond individual demographics. Neighborhoods greater in racial diversity were associated with less smoking. Greater neighborhood income and home ownership were associated with less smoking. Greater resident age and income were associated with mens prostate cancer screening. Findings have implications for interventions to combat the impact of historical racism on cancer.
1804,Parental occupational exposures are suggested as contributing causes of childhood cancer . Children age 19 born in Denmark and diagnosed with leukemia central nervous system cancers and likely prenatally initiated cancers neuroblastoma retinoblastoma and acute lymphoid leukemia n 4268 were identified using Danish registries . We randomly selected twenty five controls per case matched on birth year and sex . Parents and their employment histories were extracted from nationwide registries . We examined occupational dust exposures perinatally and postnatally in both parents . Odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression . Maternal wood dust exposure from birth to diagnosis was associated with increased risks of leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia exposure to paper dust was associated with CNS cancer .. Paternal exposure to wood dust was associated with astrocytoma in both periods and CNS cancer in the perinatal period . The increased risk observed for potentially prenatally initiated cancers in relation to wood was driven by ORs for neuroblastoma and hepatoblastoma . An OR of 2.58 for CNS cancer was associated with both parents working in textile industries postnatally . The study suggests that parental exposure to wood dust may increase risk of specific childhood cancers .,Maternal wood exposure around birth was associated with leukemia and AML. Maternal paper exposure around birth was associated with CNS cancer. Paternal wood exposure around birth was association with CNS cancer. Paternal wood exposure around birth and until diagnosis was associated with astrocytoma. Paternal wood exposure was associated with prenatal cancers driven by hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma.
1805,The objective of this study was to analyze the survival of patients with lung cancer by TNM stage in the 4 year periods 20032006 20072010 and 20112014 treated in the Basque Health Service and to compare this with survival in an equivalent sample of the general population . A retrospective observational design was applied to cases from the Hospital Cancer Registry of Euskadi . A cohort of 11 635 patients had complete data for the following variables TNM stage age sex histology date of diagnosis vital status and date of death . Relative survival and Cox and parametric regression models were used to assess changes in survival . The lung cancer 5 year survival probability decreased with increasing stage from 5065 in patients with stage I disease to 23 in those with stage IV disease . Comparing patients diagnosed from 20112014 and 20032006 we found that survival improved the risk of death in 20032006 was 1.66 for stage I 1.51 for stage II 1.21 for stage III and 1.10 for stage IV the 5 year relative survival increased from 11.0 to 17.8 in the period 20112014 and the years of life lost decreased significantly from 20032006 to 20112014 varying between 6.16 and 16.21 . Survival from lung cancer by stage in the Basque Country has lengthened significantly across all disease stages . Nonetheless since we estimated that lung cancer patients still have significantly lower mean survival times than the general population there is a need for more research to improve these outcomes .,Lung cancer survival increased over the period 20032011 in the Basque Country. The 5 year probability of death from lung cancer remained slightly above 80 . The years of life lost varied from 6.16 Stage I to 16.21 Stage IV . Lung cancer patients survival time is a fifth that of the general population.
1806,Even though the survival of childhood cancer has improved over the last decades there are still children dying shortly after diagnosis . The aim of the study is to add to understanding of the reasons for deaths shortly after date of diagnosis . Using data of the population based German Childhood Cancer Registry we compared characteristics of 671 children with cancer who died within 30 days of diagnosis to 53 649 patients with childhood cancer who survived longer . In addition to a descriptive analysis we used logistic regression with multivariable fractional polynomials to describe the relationship between early death with age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis . The number of early death cases and the risk of early death have decreased considerably since 1980 . Children under one year of age were at highest early death risk . These results are similar to results from other studies . Moreover children with acute myeloid leukemia and hepatic tumors had a higher early death risk children with acute lymphoid leukemia a lower risk compared to patients with central nervous system tumors used as a reference group . Even though the risk for early death has declined overall with advances in diagnosis and therapy special attention needs to be paid to infants and children with AML and hepatic tumors who are especially at risk .,There are still children dying shortly after cancer diagnosis. The risk for early death in Germany has decreased from 2.6 in the 1980s to 0.6 in the 2010s. Infants were at higher risk than older children 3.1 of infants with cancer died early . Children with AML are especially vulnerable 5.5 of children with AML died early .
1807,Military women are faced with unique circumstances including frequent relocation and occupational factors that may influence their participation in routine cervical cancer screening . No data on programmatic participation in cervical cancer screening in Canadian Armed Forces women has been synthesized to date . To estimate cervical cancer screening rates in Canadian military women using clinical and administrative data sources . Actively serving Regular Force females who were 25 years of age between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017 were included in the study . Scanned documents containing Papanicolaou test results were extracted from electronic health records and further linked to demographic data sources . Screening coverage rates were calculated over the three year study period and results were stratified by both military command and rank . The study period yielded over 23 000 person years of data . The average screening rate over this period was 77.7 and was highest in the 4560 year age group . Variations in rates were observed by rank and command with higher screening rates observed in Officers and Royal Canadian Navy staff . Overall screening rates showed a declining trend for all groups across the study period . Cervical cancer screening rates amongst CAF members are currently below recommended guidelines and appear to be declining . These trends mirror those observed more widely in the general Canadian population and may be a consequence of recent changes to guidelines for both cervical cancer and human papillomavirus screening .,Canadian military women face a unique set of occupational circumstances. Cervical cancer screening rates have not yet been studied in Canadian military women. Using administrative data this study estimates screening coverage in Canadian military women at 77.7 . This coverage rate is below the 80 recommended target and appears to be declining over time.
1808,Microsatellite instability is a prognostic and predictive factor in colorectal cancer . Previous trials have acknowledged that MSI prevalence varies according to ethnicity . The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSI among CRC patients from Costa Rica and to analyze its influence on overall survival and response to fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy . We conducted a retrospective cohort study with all diagnosed CRC cases from 2010 to 2015 in a referral center in San Jos Costa Rica . MSI was determined by immunohistochemical analysis . Clinical and epidemiological variables were retrieved from medical records . An univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between MSI and mortality in the overall population and in those patients treated or not with fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy . 553 CRC patients were identified during the study timeframe and 165 of them were diagnosed with MSI . MSI was associated with M1 disease and right sided tumor location . After adjusting for potential confounders MSI was an independent prognostic factor for OS 0.56 95 CI 0.43 0.67 Log rank MSI was detected in a higher proportion of CRC patients than previously reported for other non Hispanic populations . MSI was an independent prognostic factor for OS but did not predict the efficacy of cytotoxic treatment with Fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy .,Microsatellite instability affects one third of colorectal cancer patients from Costa Rica. MSI was a prognostic variable for overall survival. MSI was not a predictive marker for chemotherapy efficacy.
1809,Lack of participation in cervical cancer screening in underserved populations has been attributed to access to care particularly among women in rural areas . Federally Qualified Health Centers were created to address this need in medically underserved populations . This study observed proximity to three health centers in relation to cervical cancer screening rates in South Carolina . Data were obtained from FQHC patient visits between 20072010 and were limited to women eligible for cervical cancer screening . ArcGIS was used to geocode patients addresses and FQHC locations and distance was calculated . Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risk of obtaining cervical cancer screening within one yearor ever stratified by residential area . Findings differed markedly by center and urban rural status . Increased travel distance significantly increased the likelihood of cervical cancer screening at two FQHC sites while significantly decreasing the likelihood of screening at the 3rd site .,Low cervical cancer screening may be attributed to lack of access among women in rural areas in South Carolina. Distance had a mixed impact on cervical cancer screening for patients in the three health centers. Center specific environmental and contextual factors may have had an impact on the association between travel distance and screening rates.
1810,It has been reported that the number of children a mother has may impact on her concept of health and behavior and there is a need to understand the role of children in the acceptability of human papillomavirus testing and vaccination among Chinese mothers . A cross sectional survey was conducted between January and June 2015 in Shenzhen China in which representative females were recruited from healthcare institutions through the Cervical Cancer Prevention Network . A total of 9058 females were included . Women with one child had a greater awareness of HPV and its vaccine and were more likely to receive HPV testing and vaccination than those with two or more children . Mothers having one child who was a daughter were more likely to receive HPV testing and HPV vaccination than those having two or more children but without a daughter . Our findings provide a novel insight into cervical cancer prevention a smaller number of children helps to improve a mothers awareness of HPV and its vaccine to promote their practice for HPV testing and to promote the acceptability of HPV vaccination . Having one or more daughters synergistically interacts with having fewer children in facilitating a mothers positive involvement in action against HPV infection .,Compared to women with multiple children women having one child were more likely to receive HPV testing and vaccination. The number and gender of children synergistically impact a mothers involvement in action against HPV infection. HPV related health education campaigns should be placed on mothers who have multiple children but no daughter.
1811,Although a number of previous studies have noted the association between body mass index and upper gastrointestinal cancer risk little evidence exists in the Chinese esophageal squamous dysplasia population . This prospective study investigated the association between BMI and UGI cancer risk in the Linxian Dysplasia Nutrition Intervention Trial cohort . A total of 3298 participants were included in the final analysis . Asian specific BMI cut offs were used to define BMI subgroups underweight 18.5 kg m During over 30 years of follow up we identified 654 incident esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases and 434 gastric cancer cases which included 88 gastric non cardia carcinoma and 346 gastric cardia carcinoma cases . Relative to normal weight overweight or obesity were associated with a significantly reduced risk of ESCC after multivariate adjustment including age at baseline gender smoking drinking family history of cancer education and consumption of fresh fruit . Subgroup analyses found that clear effects were evident in women and subjects with a family history of cancer . No association with gastric cancer was observed in any subjects or subgroups . Overweight obesity was associated with decreased risk of ESCC in this dysplasia population particularly in women and persons who had a family history of cancer . Future studies are needed to confirm these findings .,This study was the first study to examine the association between BMI and risk of UGI cancer in dysplasia population. Overweight or obese could decrease the risk of ESCC particularly in women and persons with family history of cancer. No associations between BMI and GC risk were observed in any subjects or subgroups.
1812,There is a need to understand structural issues such as differential access to or utilization of technologies or capabilities to better understand racial disparities in cancer outcomes . The objective of this work was to evaluate time to treatment and survival in relation to cancer related diagnostic and treatment technologies of the diagnosing hospital . Colorectal tumor level data from George Cancer Registry was merged with hospital level cancer technology data from the American Hospital Association . Cox proportional hazard models were used to model time to treatment and time to death following cancer diagnosis with cancer related technologies for colon and rectosigmoid rectal tumors stratified by race and controlling for personal and tumor characteristics . Black individuals experienced lower likelihood of treatment for colon tumors but not significantly different survival . Larger capacity or size indicators were associated with higher likelihood of treatment in whites but not blacks . Higher counts of treatment related technologies were associated with better survival in whites but not blacks . Virtual colonoscopy emerged as a technology related to survival favorably in whites and blacks . Overall results were similar for rectosigmoid rectal tumors as observed for colon tumors . The role of cancer related technologies presence or utilization for colorectal cancer outcomes and potential racial disparities warrants further research .,Factors related to size or capacity of the hospital were associated with colorectal tumor time to treatment and survival. Racial disparities observed for time to treatment and survival associated with presence of treatment related technologies. Presence of virtual colonoscopy was associated with lower likelihood of death.
1813,This study investigated the association of breast lobular involution status and three inflammatory markers as predictors of survival among breast cancer patients in the Multiethnic Cohort . Lobular involution was evaluated in tissue sections of normal breast tissue and COX 2 TNF and TGF proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tumor microarrays . A summary score added the expression levels of the three markers . Cox regression was applied to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals with age as the time metric and adjustment for factors known to affect mortality . Among 254 women with pathologic blocks and follow up information 54 all cause and 10 breast cancer specific deaths were identified after a mean follow up time of 16.0 3.1 years . For 214 participants an inflammatory score was available and 157 women had information on lobular involution . Lobular involution was not significantly associated with survival . Expression of both COX 2 and TNF were significant predictors of lower survival while the association for TGF was weaker . When combined into one overall inflammation score both intermediate and high scores were associated with higher mortality but only the latter was statistically significant . No significant association with breast cancer specific mortality was detected . These results suggest that strong expression of inflammatory markers in breast tissue predicts a poorer prognosis possibly due to a system wide state of chronic inflammation .,Little is known about the influence of the tissue specific characteristics with survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer. This study examined breast lobular involution and three inflammatory markers as predictors of breast cancer survival in the Multiethnic Cohort. Strong expression of inflammatory markers but not involution in breast tissue predicted a poorer prognosis among women with breast cancer. Addressing underlying causes of chronic inflammation in breast cancer patients may help to improve overall health and life expectancy.
1814,Loss of life expectancy provides valuable insights into the impact of cancer . We evaluated the temporal trends in LOLE for Australian cancer patients and the gain in life years for recently diagnosed patients due to survival improvements . Analysis was conducted using an Australian population based cohort aged 5089 years who were primarily diagnosed with one of 19 leading cancers between 19822015 . Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE and the proportion of life lost by year age group sex and for New South Wales only spread of disease . The total years of LOLE and gain in life years due to survival improvements were estimated for those diagnosed in 2014 . For 19 cancers combined LOLE and POLL were significantly lower for more recent diagnoses . Cancer specific temporal trends were consistent by age sex and spread of disease although the magnitude varied . Prostate kidney or non Hodgkin lymphoma experienced the largest decreases in POLL over time . For the 2014 diagnoses an estimation of 403 094 life years lost will be caused by the 19 cancers . With the increase in cancer survival over time the 2014 cohort will gain an extra 432 588 life years compared to that experienced by the 1982 cohort . While reduced impact of a cancer diagnosis on LOLE over time is encouraging the growing number of cancer survivors in Australia is likely to pose complex challenges for cancer patients their care givers and health care systems .,Loss of life expectancy and proportion of life lost significantly reduced over time among Australian cancer patients. Prostate non Hodgkin lymphoma and kidney cancers had the largest decrease in proportion of life lost. The 19 cancers included in this study were estimated to cause 403 094 life years lost among Australians diagnosed in 2014. An estimated 432 588 life years were gained for the 2014 diagnoses due to improved cancer survival since 1982.
1815,We aimed to present the time trends and geographical distribution of lung cancer in Golestan province a high risk area for pulmonary tuberculosis in Northern Iran . Data on incident primary lung cancers were obtained from the Golestan population based cancer registry . The data were analyzed by CanReg 5 software to calculate the age standardized incidence rates . We used Joinpoint software for time trend analysis . Average annual percent changes were calculated . The contribution of population aging population growth and risk to the overall changes in incidence of lung cancer were determined using partitioning analysis . Overall 1829 cases of lung cancer were registered by the GPCR during 2004 2016 of which 1274 were men and 555 were women . The results of Joinpoint regression suggested a significant increasing trend in incidence of lung cancer in Golestan province during 2004 and 2016 with more prominent increasing in rural population . The number of new cases of lung cancer increased by 131.6 of which 34.1 22.3 and 75.3 were due to population size population aging and risk respectively . Hot points of lung cancer were found in western parts of the Golestan . With high incidence rates and increasing trends of lung cancer further studies are warranted to clarify the role of TB and other risk factors on its burden in this population .,Golestan province Iran is a high risk area for esophageal cancer and tuberculosis TB . We presented trends and distribution of lung cancer LC in Golestan during 2004 2016. We found high rates and significant increasing trends in incidence of LC in Golestan. The trends were more prominent in rural area and hot points were found in western part. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of TB and other risk factors on LC burden.
1816,The routes to diagnosis and the time intervals along the diagnostic pathway affect cancer outcomes . Some data on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates can be extracted from registries or databases . When this data is incomplete inaccurate or non existing other data sources are needed . This study investigates the agreement between multiple data sources on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates of cancer pathway . Information on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates were compared across four data sources for breast colorectal lung and ovarian cancers across the UK Scandinavia Canada and Australia . Agreement on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates was assessed by Kappa and AC1 coefficients and Lins concordance correlation coefficient . 4502 patients were included in the analysis of routes to diagnosis . The agreement was almost perfect for breast cancer substantial to almost perfect for colorectal and ovarian cancers and substantial for lung cancer . 2287 patients were included in the analysis of milestone dates . The agreement was adequate for all cancer types highest agreement was seen for date of diagnosis . We found a reasonable agreement between patient physician questionnaires and registry data for routes to diagnosis and milestone dates . The agreement on routes to diagnosis was generally higher for breast cancer than for colorectal ovarian and lung cancers . Lower agreement was seen on date of first presentation to primary care and date of treatment initiation compared to date of diagnosis .,We found reasonable agreement on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates in the cancer pathway between patient physicians and cancer registry. Agreement on routes to diagnosis was higher for breast cancer than for colorectal ovarian and lung cancers. Agreement on date of diagnosis date was higher than for date of first presentation to primary care and date of treatment. Combining multiple data sources can provide more complete and reliable information on the cancer diagnostic pathway.
1817,A growing body of evidence has suggested an association between Hepatitis C virus infection and risk of pancreatic cancer . Herein we conducted a meta analysis of available evidence to explore this association . We systematically retrieved studies that investigated the association between HCV infection and risk of PAC . Pooled odds ratio with corresponding 95 confidence interval of PAC for patients with HCV infection was calculated using the fixed or random effects model . A total of 16 studies were included in this meta analysis . Combined patients with HCV infection were more likely to develop PAC than people without it pooled OR 1.51 95 CI 1.31 1.74 HCV infection was associated with increased risk of PAC but this association was attenuated among studies that adjusted their results for potential risk factors for PAC . Future prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm this association .,This meta analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Adjusting for diabetes alcohol intake and smoking attenuated the association. Future population based prospective cohort studies are highly recommended.
1818,Cancers comprise a significant proportion of urologic workload . The epidemiology of prostate and renal cancers is well described . We report the incidence survival and predictors of survival for non prostate non renal urologic cancers between 1977 and 2013 . All patients in the South Australian Cancer Registry diagnosed with bladder testis penis renal pelvis ureteric and other male genital organ cancers between 1977 and 2013 were included . Demographic data included age sex year of diagnosis grade and metropolitan rural status . Changes in incidence survival and predictors of survival are reported for each cancer type . Between 1977 and 2013 bladder cancer was the most common of the studied urologic cancers . Age standardized incidence rate for bladder cancer decreased from 15.69.0 per 100 000 in 2013 0.97 p 0.05 . Between 1977 and 2013 mortality has increased in patients with bladder cancer . Testicular cancer diagnoses increased from 1.7 to 4.7 per 100 000 through 19772012 . Survival has increased . Incidence of penile cancers has increased from 0.23 to 0.46 per 100 000 Penile cancer survival has remained static .Five and ten year survival estimates were highest for testicular cancer 93.4 and 91.1 respectively and lowest for renal pelvis 36.3 and 24.6 . The incidence of non prostate non renal urologic cancers remains low and stable . The age standardized incidence of testicular cancer has increased whilst there has been a decline in the age standardized incidence of bladder cancer . Bladder cancer survival has decreased since the 1970s .,This study examines non prostate non renal urologic cancers from 1977 to 2013 in South Australia. Incidence of testis cancer is rising. Testis cancer had the best survival. Renal pelvis and ureter cancers have the worst survival. Age and grade at diagnosis are consistent predictors of all cause mortality. Bladder cancer survival has decreased since the 1970s.
1819,Advances in early detection and treatment of breast cancer have led to better survival . Consequently more women with BrCA now die from non BrCA causes . We investigated all cause and other cause survival among women with BrCA . From the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian cohort we selected women diagnosed with BrCA from 1994 2014 . To compare survival of cases to non cases we used exposure density sampling . We computed standard mortality ratios and performed Cox proportional hazards models with matched case control sets controlling for demographics and additional covariates . We also examined survival by stage within BrCA cases . Among 78 215 women enrolled in PLCO there were 1211 in situ and 4790 invasive BrCA cases . 15 year survival rates were 97.1 and 77.2 among in situ and 86.4 and 73.4 among invasive cases . For other cause mortality in situ cases had lower risk in models I and II versus controls . All cause mortality HRs for in situ cases were 0.83 and 0.85 in Models I and II respectively . Other cause mortality was similar among invasive cases and controls . Within BrCA cases higher stage was associated with increased other cause mortality HRs were 1.2 and 1.7 for stage II and III IV versus stage I . Mortality from other causes exceeded that of BrCA in both in situ and invasive cases highlighting the importance of managing patients chronic conditions during and following cancer treatment .,More women with breast cancer die of other causes than of their cancer. Women with in situ breast cancer have better survival than age matched controls. Other cause survival decreases with increasing breast cancer stage.
1820,Social inequalities in survival after cancer diagnosis have been described in several high income countries all cancer sites combined and for several specific cancer sites . The objective of this study was to analyze 5 year net survival after cancer diagnosis in a middle income country according to the characteristics at the district level . Costa Rican Cancer Registry is a national population based registry . All cases diagnosed between January 1 2011 and December 31 2015 were included . Deaths that occurred before December 31 2018 were identified . An ecological study was implemented . The 477 districts were described using the 2011 Census . Urbanity and wealth was assessed . Socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival were measured using multivariable flexible parametric models . Life tables by socio economic status were used . 5 year net survival ranged from 9 for liver cancer to 98 for in situ cervical cancer . Patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged districts experienced poorer cancer survival at 5years after taking into account the inequalities in survival in the general population . This result was robust and was found at 1 2 and 5years in all cancer combined and in low medium and high lethality cancers . There was no difference according to the area except for low lethality cancers at 1year . Despite its universal and solidarity based health system Costa Rica is experiencing social inequalities in survival after cancer diagnosis .,Costa Rica is experiencing social inequalities in cancer survival after diagnosis. Patients living in disadvantaged districts experienced poorer survival. There was no difference according to the area except for low lethality cancers at 1year. Inequalities were found in low medium and high lethality cancers. Inequalities were found at 1 2 and 5years.
1821,Lymphoma etiology remains ill defined but immune factors seem to play a major role . The Bacillus Calmette Gurin vaccine a non specific stimulator of the cellular immune response could influence lymphoma risk . Previous studies addressing this issue showed conflicting results . In this study we performed a systematic review and meta analysis to synthesize the epidemiological evidence . We conducted a systematic search of all relevant articles in PubMed Embase Library and Archives Canada and Cochrane databases up to November 1,The etiology of lymphoma is unclear but immune status seems to play a major role. This is the first meta analysis assessing the impact of the BCG vaccine on lymphoma. Considering all studies the BCG vaccine increased non Hodgkins lymphoma risk. Restricting to higher quality studies the BCG vaccine was not associated with lymphoma. Future studies with robust methodology are needed to draw definitive conclusions.
1822,On average 185 children are diagnosed each year in France with a cancer in their first year of life representing 11 of cancers diagnosed in children less than 15 years . A retrospective population based observational study was conducted between 2000 and 2014 of all infants with a diagnosis of cancer using the National Registry of Childhood Cancers Database . Out of 2760 cases of primary cancers in infancy there were mainly neuroblastomas 30.1 central nervous system tumors leukemias retinoblastomas and Wilms tumors . Embryonal malignancies accounted for 55.2 of cases . Most diagnoses showed a male excess particularly for malignant gonadal germ cell tumors with a 17.5 sex ratio . The annual incidence rate 242.9 per million infants overall was stable over the study period for all types of cancer . Most deaths occurred within the first month of life . The 5 year overall survival was 81.0 with large contrasts between diagnoses . The best 5 y OS were observed for retinoblastomas carcinomas nephroblastomas GCT neuroblastomas and hepatoblastomas . Conversely the lowest 5 y OS were observed for acute myeloid leukemias CNS tumors and lymphoid leukemias . We observed no substantial change over time in 20002004 and 82.6 in 20102014 for all cancers combined . The same result has been found whatever the diagnostic group . Our results contribute to better understand these tumors by quantifying their impact on the French population and assessing the burden of some devastating infant cancers .,The most frequent infant cancers neuroblastomas 30 CNS tumors 16 leukemias 15 and retinoblastomas 12 . Embryonal malignancies accounted for 55 of cases. Annual incidence rate 243 per million infants overall stable over the 2000 2014 period. 5 year overall survival 5 yOS was 81 and 71 of deaths occurred within the first month of life. Lowest 5 yOS 65 observed for acute myeloid leukemias CNS tumors and lymphoid leukemias.
1823,Rural dwellers have poorer cancer outcomes than urban counterparts for reasons which are unclear . At healthcare institution level poorer access to investigations and different clinical decision making by rural primary healthcare practitioners could be important . To compare access to investigations attitudes to cancer diagnosis and clinical decision making between rural and urban PCPs . A vignette based cross sectional survey of rural and urban PCPs in 20 European countries . Data on PCPs decision making and attitudes to cancer diagnosis were based on clinical scenarios . Comparisons were made using tests of proportion univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression . Of the 1779 PCPs completing the survey 541 30.4 practiced rurally . Rural PCPs had significantly less direct access to all investigative modalities ultrasound endoscopy x ray and advanced screening . Rural PCPs were as likely as urban PCPs to take diagnostic action at the index consultation in all four clinical vignettes for lung 0.90 0.721.12 ovarian 0.95 0.751.19 breast 0.87 0.691.09 colorectal 0.98 0.751.30 . Rural PCPs were less likely to refer to a specialist at the index consultation for ovarian cancer . Rural PCPs were significantly more likely to report that their patients faced barriers to accessing specialist care but practitioners did not report greater difficulties making specialist referral than their urban counterparts European rural PCPs report poorer access to investigations but are at least as likely as urban PCPs to investigate or refer patients that might have cancer at the index consultation .,Rural cancer patients have poorer cancer outcomes than urban counterparts. The study reports data from 1779 primary care practitioners from across Europe. European rural primary care practitioners have less direct access to cancer investigations. But European rural practitioners take diagnostic action for potential cancer just as promptly. Service organization is a more likely cause of rural cancer inequality than practitioner behaviour.
1824,Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with poor prognosis in patients with solid tumors . However few studies have assessed the association between socioeconomic parameters and prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and these report conflicting results . Our monocentric study assessed the impact of socioeconomic deprivation using the validated EPICES questionnaires were given to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML at the Paoli Calmettes Institute between July 2012 and December 2014 . Study participants were categorized as non deprived deprived or very deprived . The primary endpoint was Overall Survival . The independence of EPICES score effects was analyzed via Cox regression with adjustment for confounding factors . 209 AML patients received the questionnaire 149 patients responded . The median EPICES score was 23.6 26.8 and 10.1 of patients were deprived and very deprived respectively . OS was 23.16 months . According to multivariate analysis a very deprived EPICES score European Leukemia Net categories age smoking and the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplantation were independent factors associated with decreased OS . Our results underscore the importance of integrating nonbiological factors in the prognostic stratification of AML patients . The very deprived population exhibited worse OS confirming that socioeconomic parameters play a role in patient outcomes in AML . Very deprived patients with AML should receive specific attention and adapted clinical management .,In intensively treated AML patients 26.8 were deprived and 10.1 very deprived according to the EPICES index. The very deprived subgroup and patients with any history of smoking had worse overall survival OS independently of others known prognostic factors. The most deprived patients may benefit from adjusted therapeutic management. Effect of deprivation assessed with the EPICES index should be studied in a larger and multicenter study.
1825,Few studies have investigated the possible association between endosalpingiosis and ovarian cancer therefore we assessed whether there is an association between histological confirmed endosalpingiosis and ovarian cancer . We identified all women with a histological diagnosis of endosalpingiosis between 1990 and 2015 from the Dutch nationwide registry of histopathology and cytopathology . We used women with a benign dermal nevus as controls . Histology results for cancer of the ovaries fallopian tubes and peritoneum between January 1990 and July 2017 were retrieved . Incidence rate ratios were estimated for ovarian cancer and its subtypes . We found 2490 women with a histological diagnosis of endosalpingiosis of which 1005 women 40.4 had concurrent endometriosis . The age adjusted IRR for ovarian cancer in endosalpingiosis patients was 43.7 . Excluding cases with concurrent endometriosis resulted in an age adjusted IRR of 38.8 . IRRs were 2.4 and 1.8 respectively when excluding synchronously diagnosed cases . The increased IRRs seem to be caused by an increased risk of clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancer subtypes . This study shows an association between histological diagnosed endosalpingiosis and ovarian cancer . The association with endometrioid and clear cell subtypes seems most outspoken . Additionally this study shows that this association is independent of histological endometriosis diagnosis making it important for pathologists to report endosalpingiosis accurately and for gynaecologists to be more aware of the increased association of ovarian cancer in women with endosalpingiosis .,Histological proven endosalpingiosis is associated with ovarian cancer. This association is independent of concurrent histological endometriosis. Pathologist are advised to report endosalpingiosis whenever they encounter it.
1826,The Johannesburg Cancer Study aims were to examine whether cancer risk factors identified in Western countries applied to black patients in Johannesburg South Africa and to understand the impact of HIV on cancer risk with a view to identifying previously unrecognised HIV associated cancers .,Cancer cohort recruitment methodology for low resource environment. 20 years of data to identify risk factors for cancer development in black patients. 24 971 black patients with histologically proven cancer of any type were enrolled. Serum and DNA samples are available for serological and genomic analysis. Viral infections leading lifestyle risk factors are key in cancer aetiology in SA.
1827,Epidemiologic information on rare cancers is scarce outside of the Western countries . The project surveillance of rare cancers in Asia provides for the first time the burden of rare cancers in some Asian countries based on the latest list . 1 to assess whether the European list of rare cancers fits the Asian setting and 2 to compare the incidences of rare cancers between Europe and Asian countries . Population based cancer registry data on patients diagnosed from 2011 to 2015 in Japan Korea and Taiwan and patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2007 in 94 European registries were analysed . The incidences for all cancers were calculated they were then grouped into several tiers and families according to the rare cancer list and whether cancers rare was examined . Rare cancer counts according to the list in the observed population were 196 in Japan 203 in Korea 198 in Taiwan and 198 in the EU . The proportions of rare in overall incidence were 16.3 in Japan 23.7 in Korea 24.2 in Taiwan and 22.2 in the EU . The numbers of newly diagnosed rare cancer cases in 2015 were 140 188 in Japan 52 071 in Korea and 24 147 in Taiwan . Most rare cancers in Europe were also rare in the Asian countries considered . The observed differences were due to well known risk factors . The European definition and list of rare cancers appear to reflect well cancer incidence in East Asia .,Proportions of rare in overall incidence were around 1624 in the 3 Asia and in EU. Most rare cancers in Europe were also rare in the Asian countries considered. Observed differences were due to well known risk factors.
1828,Sub optimal use or interpretation of imaging investigations prior to diagnosis of certain cancers may be associated with less timely diagnosis but pre diagnostic imaging activity for urological cancer is unknown . We analysed linked data derived from primary and secondary care records and cancer registration to evaluate the use of clinically relevant imaging tests pre diagnosis in patients with bladder and kidney cancer diagnosed in 2012 15 in England . As pre diagnostic imaging activity increased from background rate 8 months pre diagnosis we used logistic regression to determine factors associated with first imaging test occurring 48 months pre diagnosis considering that such instances may reflect possible missed opportunities for expediting the diagnosis . 1963 patients with bladder or kidney cancer had at least one imaging test in the 8 months pre diagnosis . 420 of patients had their first imaging test 48 months pre diagnosis that being ultrasound CT and X ray in 48 43 and 9 of those cases respectively . Factors associated with greater risk of a first imaging test 48 months pre diagnosis were kidney cancer diagnosis at stages other than stage IV first imaging having been an X ray test requested by GP and absence of haematuria before the imaging request . About 1 in 5 patients with urological cancers receive relevant first imaging investigations 48 months prior to diagnosis which may represent potential missed diagnostic opportunities for earlier diagnosis .,Suboptimal imaging test use may represent missed opportunities for more timely diagnosis of bladder and kidney cancer. Our novel linked dataset described patterns of imaging test use and predictors of a first imaging test use in patients with these cancers. 1 in 5 patients received a longer than average time to diagnosis of 48 months after a first imaging test. Patients with less specific symptoms and with kidney cancer were more likely to receive a first imaging test 48 months before diagnosis.
1829,The incidence of early onset colorectal cancer has been reported to increase and patients with eoCRC seem to be diagnosed at more advanced stages compared to elderly patients . The aim of this study was to describe patient and disease characteristics symptomatology and the incidence of eoCRC in a national cohort . 521 eoCRC patients diagnosed with histologically verified colorectal cancer during the years 20012013 were identified in national databases and compared to more than 15 000 CRC patients aged 6675 years . Age adjusted incidence was calculated for eoCRC patients and various sub analyses were performed . More advanced stages were seen in eoCRC patients compared to elderly patients . Differences were statistically significant in colon cancer but not in rectal cancer . A significant difference in sex distribution was seen between right and left sided tumors in the eoCRC group . The age adjusted incidence rate increased during the study period and significant annual percent changes were seen in young females and left sided tumor localization respectively . In this nationwide cohort of eoCRC patients our results confirm that young patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and that the incidence of eoCRC is increasing .,This study was an attempt to contribute data from a complete national cohort of patients with early onset colorectal cancer eoCRC . Our data confirms that eoCRC patients present with more advanced stages compared to elderly CRC patients. The incidence of eoCRC was rising in the study period especially in young females and patients with left sided colon and rectal cancers. Results from this study can be used as inspiration to further research in this topic.
1830,Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia over recent decades . Loss of life expectancy is a useful measure for assessing cancer survival at a population level . Some previous studies estimating LOLE have required a minimum follow up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled extrapolation while others have not . The first aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimum length of follow up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed in 2006 with female breast colorectal prostate lung cervical combined oesophageal and stomach cancers and melanoma . Based on these results the second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for diagnoses between 1982 and 2016 . Person level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 1589 years . The analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006 followed to the end of 2006 2011 or 2016 . To achieve the second study aim the diagnostic period was extended to the end of 2016 . Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible parametric relative survival models . Single year age and sex specific death rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life expectancy . Temporal changes were not reported for prostate cervical oesophageal and stomach cancers or melanoma due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum follow up time or estimate imprecision . Marked reductions in LOLE were observed for female breast and colorectal cancer . There was minimal absolute reduction for lung cancer where LOLE remained high . This study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE finding variation in estimates with differing minimum follow up or high parameter uncertainty for most included cancer types . Temporal changes in LOLE in turn reflected changes in the life expectancy of the general population cancer detection and management . These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting LOLE estimates .,Loss of life expectancy LOLE is an adjunct to existing cancer survival measures. The effect of minimum follow up is important for assessing long term temporal trends. LOLE in Western Australia differed by minimum follow up time for cervical prostate oesophageal and stomach cancers and melanoma. LOLE decreased for female breast and colorectal from 1982 to 2016. LOLE remained high for lung cancer e.g. 16.7 years for a male aged 65 years diagnosed in 2016 .
1831,Wilms tumor is the most frequently diagnosed renal tumor in children . Little is known about its etiology . The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of specific exposures related to parental habits such as parental smoking maternal alcohol consumption and the use of household pesticides during pregnancy . The ESTELLE study was a nationwide case control study that included 117 Wilms tumor cases and 1100 control children from the general French population frequency matched by age and gender . Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals . After controlling for matching variables and potential confounders the maternal use of any type of pesticide during pregnancy was associated with the risk of Wilms tumor in children . Insecticides were the most commonly reported type of pesticide and there was a positive association with their use . The association was stronger when they were used more often than once a month . Neither maternal smoking during pregnancy nor paternal smoking during preconception pregnancy was associated with a risk of Wilms tumor and 1.1 respectively . No association was observed with maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy . Our findings suggest an association between the maternal use of household pesticides during pregnancy and the risk of Wilms tumor .,Perinatal exposures due to maternal habits like smoking alcohol consumption and domestic use of pesticides are suspected risk factors of Wilms tumor. Our population based case control study shows that household insecticide use during pregnancy may be associated to an increased risk of Wilms tumor. The study does not suggest any role of parental smoking or maternal drinking in the etiology of Wilms tumor.
1832,High thyroid hormone values have been associated with an increased risk of incident cancers especially breast cancer but also lung cancer and any solid cancers . We explored whether there is an increased risk of overall and cause specific cancers in those receiving levothyroxine treatment .,We found a slight increased overall cancer risk associated with levothyroxine treatment for both men and women. For women increased risks were found for cancers of the breast endometrium and female genitals ovaries not included . For women increased risks were also found for some gastrointestinal cancers i.e. of stomach colon liver and pancreas. For women increased risks were also found for cancers of urinary bladder skin leukemia and unspecified primary tumor. For men increased risks were found for cancers of the thyroid gland and other endocrine glands.
1833,The population based Estonian Cancer Registry has maintained a database of cancer cases since 1968 . Between 2001 and 2007 the ECR was prohibited from linking cancer records to death certificates . In January 2008 the prohibition was lifted and two years later the ECR was able to begin tracing back unmatched deaths . This paper estimates the effect of the linkage ban on reported cancer incidence and survival . Incident cancers in 20012007 were extracted from the ECR database in May 2018 to allow for late registrations . Two datasets were created one with all incident cases and another without death certificate initiated cases . Using both datasets age standardised incidence rates and their ratios age standardised five year relative survival ratios and excess mortality rate ratios were calculated . In 20012007 46 535 incident cancers were registered in the ECR . Of them 2299 were DCI cases . The inclusion of DCI cases increased the ASIR for overall cancer by 6 in men and 3 in women . An increase 10 in ASIR for lung liver and pancreatic cancer was observed . The effect of accrued DCI cases to the ARSR was minor . Excess mortality in the dataset without DCI cases was 4 underestimated in men and 3 in women . Biases in cancer incidence and survival measures generated by the temporary record linkage ban were largely correctable by using trace back procedures when this became possible . Nevertheless this type of ban and the arguments put forward to justify it harm disease registration and register based research .,A ban to link cancer and death records biases incidence and survival measures. The ban results in significant underreporting of lung liver and pancreatic cancers. The ban discredits disease registration register based research and researchers.
1834,Aggregation of all Black populations in US cancer mortality profiles masks remarkable heterogeneity by place of birth . Comparing U.S born African Americans with African and Afro Caribbean immigrants may highlight specific cancer prevention and control needs and clarify global cancer epidemiology . Such a comparison has yet to be undertaken on a population basis . Using 20122017 vital statistics data from California Florida Minnesota and New York age standardized cancer mortality rates were computed for distinct Black populations . Comparisons were made to the majority White population using mortality rate ratios obtained from negative binomial regression . Of the 83 460 cancer deaths analyzed among Blacks nearly 20 were immigrants . African males and females had the lowest all sites combined cancer mortality rates African Americans had the highest while Afro Caribbean were in between . The average Black White MRR was significant for prostate endometrial stomach multiple myeloma premenopausal breast liver and cervical cancers . While in aggregate Blacks in the US have high cancer mortality rates race itself is not the primary determinant of these disparities . Black immigrant populations show lower cancer mortality than both African Americans and Whites especially for cancers where environmental factors feature more predominantly lung colorectal and breast . Even for cancers with high mortality among all African descent groups this study suggests a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors . Endometrial cancer was unique mortality rates were similarly high for all three analyzed Black groups .,Aggregating Black populations in the US overlooks important cancer differences. US Blacks had the highest mortality rates for common and infection related cancers. Caribbean Blacks had intermediate rates African Blacks had the lowest rates. Prostate cancer rates were higher in West Africans East Africans had high liver rates. Research on genetic and environmental cancer risk within Black populations is needed.
1835,We investigated the influence preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus and antidiabetic drugs have on all cause and cause specific mortality among Medicaid insured women diagnosed with breast cancer . 9221 women aged 64 years diagnosed with breast cancer and reported to the New York State Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2016 were linked with Medicaid claims . Preexisting T2DM was determined by three diagnosis claims for T2DM with at least one claim prior to breast cancer diagnosis and a prescription claim for an antidiabetic drug within three months following breast cancer diagnosis . Estimated menopausal status was determined by age . Hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for confounders . Women with preexisting T2DM had greater all cause cancer specific and cardiovascular specific mortality hazard compared to nondiabetic women . In subgroup analyses the association between T2DM and all cause mortality was found among non Hispanic White and postmenopausal women but not among other race ethnicity groups or premenopausal women . Additionally compared to women prescribed metformin all cause mortality hazard was elevated among women prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin . Among Medicaid insured women with breast cancer those with preexisting T2DM have an increased mortality hazard especially when prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin . Further research is warranted to determine the role antidiabetic drugs have on survival among women with breast cancer .,Among women with breast cancer those with type 2 diabetes had higher mortality hazard than nondiabetics. Women prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin had an elevated mortality hazard compared to women prescribed metformin. Among women 50 years of age and older with breast cancer those with type 2 diabetes had a 47 higher mortality hazard.
1836,Long term childhood and young adult cancer survivors are at increased risk of the late effects of multiple chronic conditions . In this study we estimate the cumulative burden of subsequent malignant neoplasms cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in long term survivors of childhood and young adult cancers and associated treatment risks . Five year survivors of cancer diagnosed aged 029 years between 19922009 in Yorkshire UK were included . The cumulative count of all hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and all SMNs diagnosed up to 2015 was calculated with death as a competing risk . Associations between treatment exposures and cumulative burden were investigated using multiple failure time survival models . A total of 3464 5 year survivors were included with a median follow up of 8.2 years . Ten years post diagnosis the cumulative incidence for a respiratory admission was 6.0 a cardiovascular admission was 2.0 and SMN was 1.0 with an average of 13 events per 100 survivors observed . The risk of experiencing multiple events was higher for those treated with chemotherapy drugs with known lung toxicity . Survivors of childhood and young adult cancer experience a high burden of morbidity due to respiratory cardiovascular diseases and SMNs up to 20 years post diagnosis . Statistical methods that capture multiple morbidities and recurrent events are important when quantifying the burden of late effects in young cancer survivors .,Survivors of childhood cancer have increased risk of multiple and recurrent disease. Cumulative risk of hospitalisations for cardiovascular or respiratory conditions or cancer registration for SMN analysed. 10 years post diagnosis an average of 13 events per 100 survivors were observed.
1837,A recent meta analysis of global research found cancer patients living in rural locations are 5 less likely to survive than their urban counterparts a survival disadvantage that has never been satisfactorily explained . To describe and compare primary care involvement in the diagnosis of cancer between rural and urban patients in Scotland . To compare the length of key diagnostic pathway intervals between rural and urban cancer patients in Scotland . Participating GPs in the Scottish National Cancer Audit of cancer diagnosis collected data from primary care medical records on the diagnostic pathway of patients diagnosed in 2014 . Residential postcodes designated the patients as rural or urban dwellers . Key cancer diagnostic pathway intervals were compared using binary logistic regression . Descriptive analysis included comparison of patient characteristics and routes to diagnosis . 73 Scottish general practices provided data on 1 905 cancer diagnoses . Rural patients did not have higher odds of prolonged diagnostic intervals compared to urban patients but were significantly more likely to have had a cancer alarm feature at presentation and three or more primary care consultations prior to referral . Rural GPs were significantly more likely to perceive an avoidable delay in their patients diagnostic pathway . There was no evidence that rural patients were more likely to be subject to prolonged cancer diagnostic delays than urban patients . Rural patients may experience primary care differently in the lead up to a cancer diagnosis . The effect on outcome is probably negligible but further research is required to confirm this .,Rural patients had more cancer alarm features at first presentation. Rural patients had more pre referral consultations and blood tests. Rural GPs were more likely to perceive they caused avoidable delays for patients. Prolonged diagnostic pathway delays were not more likely four rural patients. In Scotland rurality does not appear to delay cancer diagnosis or treatment.
1838,The cumulative burden from rare cancers has not been adequately explored in Canada . This analysis aims to characterize the occurrence of rare cancers among Canadians and estimate the probability of being diagnosed with a rare cancer among cancer patients with different demographic characteristics . The Canadian Cancer Registry was used for this analysis . Cancer types were classified in three ways using the SEER site recode scheme by histology group and by site histology group . The age standardized incidence rate and 95 confidence intervals for each cancer type was estimated for diagnoses from 2006 to 2016 . Two ASIR thresholds were used to classify cancers as rare 6 100 000 year and 15 100 000 year . Log binomial regression was used to estimate the adjusted probability of having a rare cancer among those with cancer by age sex and geographic region . Using the 6 100 000 year threshold the incidence proportion of rare cancers ranged from 9.7 17.0 and ranged from 19.2 52.5 using the 15 100 000 year threshold . The adjusted probability of being diagnosed with a rare cancer was highest among those aged 19 years . There was higher concordance in estimates of the burden of rare cancers across methods to classify cancer types when the lower incidence rate threshold was used to define rare cancers . This analysis yielded evidence that rare cancers comprise a substantial proportion of annual cancer diagnoses among Canadians . Findings from this analysis point to using a lower incidence rate threshold to generate estimates of the burden of rare cancers that are robust to different cancer classification schemes .,There was an annual average of 154 900 cancer diagnoses among Canadians 20062016. The proportion of rare cancers ranged 9.752.5 using different definitions of rare. Estimated burden of rare cancers was stable across cancer classification schemes with a lower incidence threshold. The probability of having a rare cancer was low when cancers were defined by histology vs site. The effect of sex on probability of having a rare cancer varied by age.
1839,The association of population mixing using surrogates of genetic and environmental PM . ALL incidence data were obtained from Texas Cancer Registry and county population statistics from the US Census Bureau . Poisson regression was used to compare ALL incidence and PM . There is substantial and variable genetic and environmental PM among counties in Texas . Indicators of genetic PM including proportion of multiracial households ratio of Hispanics to non Hispanics and ratio of foreign to native born residents were all significantly associated with a higher incidence of ALL IRR These findings are consistent with prior patterns and magnitudes of PM association with ALL . Our findings suggest that the implicated mechanism of leukemogenesis in PM may be genetically transmitted rather than environmental .,Etiology of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Population mixing and childhood cancer. Genetic admixture and cancer
1840,Anal squamous cell carcinoma is relatively rare but its incidence and mortality have been steadily climbing in marginalized populations . We explored the impact of insurance status education and income on survival and receipt of chemoradiation therapy . We included patients with ASCC from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2016 . Socioeconomic variables included insurance status level of education income and unemployment rate . Cox proportional hazards and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of survival and receipt of chemoradiation . We included a total of 10 868 cases of ASCC . The median age was 55 10.4 were black and 65.4 were female . Overall 74.1 of patients received combination chemoradiation . In multivariate analysis poorer survival was found for Medicaid and uninsured patients and for communities with the lowest rates of high school education lowest income and highest unemployment . Patients were less likely to receive combination treatment if they were black had Medicaid insurance or lower education . Insurance status level of education income and employment impact survival and receipt of treatment in patients with ASCC . Identifying high risk patients and developing targeted interventions to improve access to treatment is integral to reducing these disparities and improving cancer survival .,Anal cancer is treatable but mortality of marginalized populations is increasing. Survival was poorer in patients with Medicaid no insurance and lower education. Patients with Medicaid and lower education received treatment less frequently. Policies that improve access to treatment for these patients can improve survival.
1841,Prostate specific antigen testing for early detection of prostate cancer is low value when it is not indicated by guidelines and the harms outweigh the benefits . In this retrospective cohort study we identify provider and patient factors associated with PSA testing particularly in situations where testing would be low value . We used electronic health record data from 2011 to 2018 representing 1 738 021 health system encounters in the United States . Using logistic generalized estimating equation models we examined patient factors provider factors and overall time trends associated with PSA testing in low value and appropriate settings . Comorbid illness 0.0 for 3 conditions vs none and no prior PSA testing were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing in low value situations while family history of prostate cancer and high prior PSA test results were associated with a greater likelihood . Men aged 5565 years were at greatest risk for PSA testing in low value situations . We identified several patient and provider factors associated with PSA testing in low value settings . Some aspects suggest attention to relevant factors for PSA testing in low value settings while others may encourage PSA testing in low value settings . The greatest likelihood of PSA testing in low value settings is among men within the age range most commonly recommended by guidelines .,Low value PSA testing is most likely among patients with prior PSA values. Men 5565 year old are most likely to receive low value PSA testing. Urologist are most likely among providers to order low value PSA testing.
1842,Biologic and epidemiologic evidence suggests that tumor cells depend on reprogrammed lipid metabolic function for survival and growth . Lipids may promote tumor recurrence by providing energy needed for proliferation . Studies have found associations of serum lipids with cancer incidence mortality and disease free mortality though they have yet to evaluate the prognostic potential of serum lipids for colorectal cancer recurrence . 341 Danish CRC patients who underwent surgical resection were actively followed between 20032011 from date of surgery until December 31 2012 or death . Serum lipids including low density lipoprotein cholesterol high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were collected at regular intervals . Lipids were assigned as time varying exposures evaluated with a one year lag . Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess recurrence rate adjusting for clinically relevant covariates . A restricted analysis was performed in a group of non statin users . Among 341 CRC patients increased HDL C appeared to have a beneficial impact on recurrence free survival for CRC patients especially among statin users for 0.1mmol L increase 0.58 95 confidence interval 0.43 0.78 . Increased LDL C and TG were not associated with RFS . Increased lipids showed a near null effect on CRC recurrence for 0.1mmol L increase LDL 1.01 among non statin users . Serum lipid levels of LDL C and TG do not appear to be associated with CRC recurrence . Further investigation of the role of HDL C in CRC recurrence may be of interest based on the suggestive inverse association observed here .,Serum lipid levels may serve as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer recurrence. High HDL C may be associated with increased RFS time for CRC patients. The association between HDL C levels and RFS for CRC patients was more pronounced in statin users.
1843,Colombians in coastal Tumaco have a lower incidence of infection was confirmed by Steiner stain and serology using African and European origin strains . Gastric histology and serum inflammatory biomarkers in dyspeptic Tumaco or Tuquerres patients were evaluated to predict progression of gastric lesions . infection was nearly universal by Steiner stain and serology . IgG response to European origin An IL 5 association with progression of gastric lesions is novel and could be evaluated in addition to TFF3 and pepsinogen I II ratio as a non invasive prognostic screen . Results suggest Tumaco patients were exposed to infectious diseases beyond Results support a prior recommendation to evaluate TFF3 and pepsinogen I II together to predict aggressive gastric histology . Our data indicate IL 5 should be further evaluated as prognostic parameter .,Coastal Colombians have lower. associated gastric cancer compared to the Andes despite comparable infection and gastritis. Lesion progression was associated with significant odds ratios for serum IL 5 trefoil factor 3 TFF3 and low pepsinogen I II ratio. Low risk patients had elevated serum inflammatory biomarkers that reflect higher exposure to infectious diseases beyond. Data suggest IL 5 TFF3 and pepsinogen I II ratios should be evaluated in combination to predict aggressive gastric histology.
1844,We examine recent trends in the major cancers occurring in the Golestan province a high risk region for upper gastrointestinal cancers in Northern Iran and provide short term cancer predictions of the future cancer burden . New cancer cases diagnosed in Golestan 20042016 were obtained from the Golestan population based cancer registry database and age standardized rates by cancer site year and sex calculated per 100 000 person years . Using IARCs The number of new cancer cases in 2025 is predicted to increase by 61.3 from 2678 cases in 2016 to 4319 cases . While a 17.6 reduction in the number of esophageal cancer cases is predicted by 2025 the number of new cases for each of the remaining major cancers is predicted to increase over the next decade including cancers of the stomach colorectum lung female breast prostate and leukemia . The changes in the population structure and risk contributed 37.8 and 23.5 respectively to the overall increase in incidence . Other than for the major upper gastrointestinal cancer types the incidence rates of common cancers observed in the province are on the rise reinforcing the need for continuous surveillance as well as the design and implementation of effective cancer control programs .,We present short term predictions of cancer incidence in Golestan Iran 20162025. Cases are predicted to rise by 61 by 2025 with 38 and 24 due to changes in population structure and risk respectively. The number of esophageal cancers are predicted to decline while breast colorectal and lung cancer cases will rise.
1845,The association between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer risk generally appears null but recent evidence suggests that risk may vary by coffee type . We examined associations of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake with colorectal cancer risk overall and with colon and rectum separately among older U.S. men and women . In 1999 47 010 men and 60 051 women with no previous diagnosis of cancer aged 4796 years in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort completed a food frequency questionnaire that assessed caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake consumption was updated in 2003 . A total of 1829 colorectal cancer cases were verified through June 2015 . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable adjusted hazard rate ratios and 95 confidence intervals adjusting for smoking history alcohol caffeinated decaffeinated coffee intake and other colorectal cancer risk factors . Consumption of 2 cups day of decaffeinated coffee compared to no decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of overall colorectal cancer HR 0.82 95 CI 0.690.96 In this prospective study higher intake of decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of colorectal colon and rectal cancers . Further study on associations of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee with colorectal cancer risk by subsite is needed .,Decaffeinated but not caffeinated coffee was associated with lower CRC risk. Risk associated with caffeinated coffee varied by subsite. Additional research should confirm subsite specific findings observed herein.
1846,The parental age at conception has been reported to be a risk factor for childhood acute leukaemia however the relationship is controversial . The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between parental age at conception and the risk of AL in Mexican children a population with a high incidence of the disease and a high prevalence of pregnancies in adolescents and young adults . A multicentre case control study was conducted . Incident AL cases younger than 17 years of age diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were included . Controls were matched with cases according to age sex and health institution . Using logistic regression analysis adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each maternal stratum after adjusting for paternal age at conception of index child . The maternal age between 25 and 29.99 years was selected as the reference category . In most strata where maternal and paternal ages were assessed no association was found with the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in their offspring . An increased risk for AML was observed when the mother was between 20 and 24.99 years of age and the father aged 2529.99 years . In addition there was a positive association for ALL when the mothers age was between 20 and 24.99 years and the father was 20 years of age however a very wide confidence interval was noted . In the present study maternal and paternal ages assessed in different strata showed little association with risk of developing ALL and AML in children . Positive associations between risk of both types of childhood AL were observed with younger paternal and maternal ages .,In most of parental ages strata no association with leukaemia risk was found. A positive association between risk of childhood ALL was observed with younger parental ages. A positive association between risk of childhood AML was observed with younger parental ages.
1847,Excess brain cancers observed after computed tomography scans could be caused by ionizing radiation . However as scans are often used to investigate symptoms of brain cancer excess cancers could also be due to reverse causation bias . We used finite mixture models to differentiate CT exposures that are plausibly causal from those due to reverse causation . Persons with at least one CT scan exposure and a subsequent diagnosis of brain cancer were selected from a cohort of 11 million young Australians . We fitted FMMs and used the posterior probability to inform the choice of exclusion periods . We validated our findings using a separate clinical dataset describing the time between first symptoms and brain cancer diagnosis . The cohort included 1028 persons with a diagnosed brain tumor and exposed to a total of 1 450 CT scans . The best fitting model was a generalized linear mixture model using the exponential distribution with three latent classes and two covariates . The 99th percentile classifier cutoff was 18.9 months . The sample size weighted mean of the 99th percentile of the PSI derived from clinical data was 15.6 months . To minimize reverse causation bias in studies of CT scan and brain cancer the optimal exclusion period is one to two years . This information will inform the interpretation of current and future studies .,Finite mixture models can be used to identify CT scans used for the diagnostic workup of brain cancer. 99 of brain scans classified to reverse causation occurred less than 18.9 months before cancer diagnosis. The sample size weighted means of the 99th percentile of the prediagnostic symptomatic interval was 15.6 months. The optimal exclusion or lag period to apply to CT scan radiation cohorts for the minimization of reverse causation bias is one to two years.
1848,Brazil experienced a robust decline in smoking prevalence rates as a consequence of public policies . Since lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking trends in lung cancer mortality rates may be used as a delayed effectiveness indicator of smoking prevention interventions . The aim of this study was to estimate lung cancer mortality trends from 1980 through 2017 and to predict temporal trends in lung cancer mortality rates in Brazil from 2016 through 2040 . Time trends in lung cancer mortality rates were evaluated using data from available public databases . Crude and age standardized mortality rates were calculated for each year sex specific mortality predictions were made for each five year period from 2016 to 2020 through 20362040 using an age period cohort model . Sex ratios were estimated using age standardized lung cancer mortality rates . A decline in age standardized lung cancer mortality rates has been observed for males since 2005 and for all predicted periods . It is expected that females aged 55 or younger will experience a reduction in lung cancer mortality from 2021 to 2026 onwards but for those aged 75 or over rates are predicted to continue increasing through 20362040 . Smoking prevention and cessation policies are essential and it is important to commit to an ethical framework whereby equity in tobacco control activities between genders is achieved . This will avert many premature and preventable smoking related deaths in the next decades .,Number of deaths by lung cancer will increase from 46 886 in 19811985 to 264 172 in 20362040. Observed lung cancer age standardized mortality rate in men decreased from 2005 to 2017. From 20162040 males age standardized lung cancer mortality rate are predict to decrease. From 20312040 females age standardized lung cancer mortality rate are predict to stop rising. Male female lung cancer mortality ratio markedly diminished between 19812040.
1849,Biological differences between the sexes have a major impact on disease and treatment outcome . In this paper we evaluate the prognostic value of sex in stage IV non small cell lung cancer in the context of routine clinical data and compare this information with other external datasets . Clinical data from stage IV NSCLC patients from Hospital Puerta de Hierro were retrieved from electronic health records using big data analytics . In addition data from the Spanish Lung Cancer Group Tumor Registry and from a published study available from the cBioPortal were analyzed . Survival curves were estimated using the KaplanMeier method . A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the prognostic value of sex . A meta analysis to compare the outcome for males and females in terms of overall survival and progression free survival was performed . The median OS time was 12 months for males and 19 months for females . Similarly females with stage IV NSCLC harboring an Using routine clinical data we confirmed the previous finding that among stage IV NSCLC patients females had a significantly better prognosis than males . The effect size of the sex was notable highlighting the fact that survival rates are usually estimated and patients are generally managed without considering the sexes separately which may lead to suboptimal results .,Sex is a major factor in disease but it is seldom taken into account for survival estimations. Using RWD we confirm that NSCLC females had a significantly better prognosis than NSCLC males. The effect size of sex on survival is high supporting sex based medicine as a new paradigm in medical practice.
1850,The incidence rate of breast cancer is increasing in low and middle income countries including Iran . We investigated the association between BC risk and physical activity body mass index and reproductive history among Iranian women . We conducted a large hospital based casecontrol study and compared 958 BC cases with 967 controls at the Cancer Institute of Iran during 20112016 . We used multiple logistic regression models and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals for the associations between BC and different risk factors including low physical activity . Women with high levels of physical activity had a lower risk of BC compared to those who were inactive . In premenopausal women the association was observed only in normal weight women while it was limited to obese women in the postmenopausal group . We found a high risk of postmenopausal BC among overweight and obese women compared to women with a normal BMI . We observed an inverse association among postmenopausal women who had between three and five children and more than six children compared to nulliparous women . Low levels of physical activity low parity and being overweight or obese were major risk factors for BC . For the first time we report a strong association between physical activity and BC risk in Iranian women .,Breast cancer tended to be inversely associated with high levels of physical activity. BMI modified the association between physical activity and breast cancer. High level physical activity was protective in the normal weight premenopausal women and in the obese postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal overweight and obese women had a higher risk of breast cancer.
1851,Cancer is the single leading cause of human deaths worldwide . The highest incidence and mortality are recorded from Africa . The last two decades have witnessed extensive research which has led to emerging prognosis and new gene therapy technologies . Cancer therapy in Africa is derived with little input from African population data . While a number of cancer studies on African populations have suggested varied susceptible variant no comprehensive review of these studies has been undertaken to assess their coverage across Africa . This study aimed to undertake a review of all molecular genetic studies that interrogated the genetic variants of cancers in African based populations . Our search methodology was modelled after the Cochrane systematic review protocol which included MeSH terms and related keywords . Ninety seven articles studying 13 cancer types were reviewed . 91 articles screened for polymorphisms using PCR based techniques while three used SNP array two used whole exome sequencing and one used pyrosequencing . North African countries undertook 51 97 studies on 12 13 cancer types while the Sub Saharan Africa countries undertook 46 97 studies on 7 13 cancer types . Twelve out of these thirteen cancer type studies suggested susceptibility to their target polymorphism . No study replicated or validated variants detected . Research on genetic determinants in African based population cancer offers translational benefits . We recommended large scale multi national genome association studies using high throughput techniques . SSA needs to receive more attention due to the shortage of this type of study and data in the region .,Cancer is the single leading cause of human deaths worldwide. African population exhibit a higher genetic diversity than other ethnic groups. No comprehensive review on African based cancer has been undertaken. Risk variants of African based cancers derived from limited African based studies will not depict causal variant. Large scale studies with high throughput techniques are required to characterise candidate genes for African based cancers.
1852,Cancer is a major disease burden globally and people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged have a higher incidence of many types of cancer . We investigated the potential to reduce socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence in Australia by lowering the prevalence of exposure to four modifiable causes smoking alcohol overweight obesity and physical inactivity . We used cancer incidence data from the Australian Cancer Database and risk factor prevalence data from the Australian National Health Survey to estimate the proportions of cancers attributable to the four factors by area level socioeconomic disadvantage . For the three risk factors where prevalence was lowest among the least disadvantaged we also estimated the potential impact of reducing prevalence in the most disadvantaged areas to that in the least disadvantaged areas . The proportion of cancer attributable to the four factors in combination ranged from 22 in the most disadvantaged areas to 14 in the least disadvantaged areas . If the prevalence of tobacco smoking overweight obesity and physical inactivity in the more disadvantaged areas were the same as that in the least disadvantaged an estimated 19 500 cancers could have been prevented in Australia between 2009 and 2013 . Reducing the prevalence of key causal factors in areas of greater social disadvantage would prevent many cases of cancer . Strategies to achieve this in highly disadvantaged areas are needed .,Prevalences of smoking obesity and physical activity are higher in more socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. People in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage also have a disproportionately high incidence of many types of cancer. Disparities could be reduced by lowering exposure to risk factors in disadvantaged areas to levels in advantaged areas. Reducing such disparities could have prevented an estimated 19 500 cancers in Australia 20092013 . In disadvantaged areas reducing smoking overall and obesity in women would have the greatest impact.
1853,The year 2019 marked the return of measles after almost two decades of unprecedented successes in global vaccination programs . Measles transmission due to sharp declines in measles mumps rubella vaccination coverage is now widespread among nations that previously saw impressive public health gains including Philippines DR Congo Madagascar Samoa many in Europe and the United States and Venezuela in the Americas . Key determinants include the interruption of vaccine health systems due to war conflict and political instability food insecurity and urbanization and an increasingly globalized vaccine hesitancy or antivaccine movement . Vaccine hesitancy is partly responsible for over 100,After decades of progress towards global measles elimination there has been an abrupt reversal in measles public health gains in multiple nations. Key determinants are driving the return of measles including war political instability food insecurity and a rise in antiscience. In the United States the antivaccine movement has emerged as a dominant force on social media e commerce platforms and the political front. A new vaccine diplomacy will be required to overcome these hurdles and resume progress in measles control and elimination.
1854,In the last five years several novel segmented RNA viruses have been discovered in ticks mosquitoes or other arthropods and two viruses including Jingmen tick virus and Alongshan virus are associated with human febrile illness in northeastern China . The viral genome includes four or five segments two of which are genetically derived from unsegmented flaviviruses . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that segmented flaviviruses belong to a separate Jingmenvirus group distinctive from the genera of,Several novel segmented flaviviruses have been discovered in various arthropods. Jingmen tick virus and Alongshan virus are associated with human febrile illness. Tick borne segmented flaviviruses are closely related to mammalian isolates. Future studies should include epidemiology animal infection model and reverse genetics.
1855,Salicylic acid is a plant hormone essential for effective resistance to viral and non viral pathogens . SA biosynthesis increases rapidly in resistant hosts when a dominant host resistance gene product recognizes a pathogen . SA stimulates resistance to viral replication intercellular spread and systemic movement . However certain viruses stimulate SA biosynthesis in susceptible hosts . This paradoxical effect limits virus titer and prevents excessive host damage suggesting that these viruses exploit SA induced resistance to optimize their accumulation . Recent work showed that SA production in plants does not simply recapitulate bacterial SA biosynthetic mechanisms and that the relative contributions of the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways to the SA pool differ markedly between plant species .,Salicylic acid SA stimulates plants to resist viral replication cell to cell movement and systemic movement. Recent work indicates that SA also contributes to meristem exclusion of viruses and symptom amelioration. Certain viruses induce SA biosynthesis as they spread through susceptible hosts suggesting they exploit SA induced resistance to prevent over accumulation and to moderate host damage. Plant SA biosynthesis from isochorismate is completed in the cytosol not in the plastid and the relative importance of the shikimate versus phenylpropanoid pathways in SA biosynthesis varies between plants
1856,The innate immune system is the first line of defense against infections with pathogens . It provides direct antiviral mechanisms to suppress the viral life cycle at multiple steps . Innate immune cells are specialized to recognize pathogen infections and activate and modulate adaptive immune responses through antigen presentation co stimulation and release of cytokines and chemokines . Measles virus which causes long lasting immunosuppression and immune amnesia primarily infects and replicates in innate and adaptive immune cells such as dendritic cells macrophages T cells and B cells . To achieve efficient replication measles virus has evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate innate immune responses by both stimulation and blocking of specific signals necessary for antiviral immunity . This review will highlight our current knowledge in this and address open questions .,Measles virus modulates innate immune responses through multiple mechanisms. Skewing with DC functions may be central for immunosuppression and immune amnesia. Viral double stranded RNA activates interferon and stress responses. The viral C protein is a polymerase co factor reducing double stranded RNA. The cellular ADAR1 is proviral by editing immunostimulatory double stranded RNA.
1857,Measles virus causes a disease with seemingly innocent symptoms such as fever and rash . However measles immune suppression causes increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections that are responsible for the majority of over 100,Measles virus utilises different cellular receptors to infect multiple cell types. Measles paradoxically induces lifelong immunity and transient immune suppression. Measles immune amnesia leads to long term increases in morbidity and mortality. Animal models in natural host species are essential to study morbillivirus pathogenesis.
1858,Clearance of measles virus is complex . Infectious virus is cleared by the adaptive immune response manifested by the characteristic maculopapular rash . CD8,In immunocompromised patients failure of measles virus clearance may lead to progressive lung or nervous system disease. Children infected at a young age may develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis a progressive nervous system disease many years later. Slow clearance of measles virus RNA from lymphoid tissue is associated with maturation of immune responses and life long immunity. Slow clearance of measles virus RNA from lymphoid tissue may impair new immune responses and increase susceptibility to other infections.
1859,The discovery of CRISPR Cas systems and their subsequent application in genome modifications and in gene expression control have fundamentally changed both basic and applied research . They have already been employed to generate novel virus resistance traits either by modifying host factors in the plant genome or by directly inducing targeted virus degradation . Here we summarise the latest developments in this field and discuss the potential applications and concerns around this technology .,Virus diseases significantly threaten agriculture. Genetic resistance is the most effective strategy to combat virus diseases in crops. CRISPR Cas technology has already been used to create a first generation of genome edited virus resistant plants. Basic research and technological advancements are needed to expedite the next generation of resistance genotypes. Engagement between scientists and the public governing bodies will determine the role of genome editing in agriculture
1860,Climate change is leading to increases in global temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns both of which are contributing to the expansion of mosquito borne arboviruses and the populations of the mosquitos that vector them . Herein we review recent evidence of emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by,Climate change is likely to increase global incidence of mosquito borne viruses. Outbreaks of disease caused by. borne arboviruses have been more frequent and more intense in recent years. Current evidence suggests that climate could be partially driving recent outbreaks across the world. More longitudinal analyses are needed at the local level to better understand climate s impact on arbovirus transmission. Recent studies in Cordoba Argentina could be useful for understanding arbovirus emergence globally.
1861,Recently a lateral flow rapid diagnostic test with good accuracy has been described . This test enables measles specific IgM antibody detection in serum capillary blood and oral fluid . RDTs have the potential to transform measles surveillance by allowing real time case confirmation outside of central regional laboratories and by facilitating a timely public health response . Measles virus genes can also be amplified and sequenced consistently from dried IgM positive RDTs stored outside of cold chain which will enable more complete virologic surveillance . Critical questions remain regarding operational use of RDTs as part of global measles surveillance . Projects to evaluate RDT use as part of national surveillance programs and to commercialize the RDT are underway .,Measles IgM rapid diagnostic tests RDT have good performance. RDTs could expand measles testing beyond central labs in resource limited settings. Evaluations of RDT use as part of national measles surveillance are ongoing. RDTs have potential to enhance global surveillance and tracking of measles strains. Rapid availability of RDT results could decrease measles public health response time.
1862,The small phenolic compound salicylic acid is a phytohormone that regulates many biological processes although it is most well known for its role in plant defense . SA is an important regulator of systemic acquired resistance a type of systemic immunity that protects uninfected parts of the plant against secondary infections by a broad spectrum of pathogens . SAR involves the generation of mobile signal at the primary infection site which translocate to distal uninfected portions and activate systemic disease resistance . Although SA was considered to not constitute the mobile SAR signal it is preferentially transported from pathogen infected to uninfected parts via the apoplast . Further investigations have revealed that distal transport of SA is indeed essential for SAR . The apoplastic SA transport is regulated by the transpirational pull and partitioning of SA between the symplast and cuticle .,SA is preferentially transported from pathogen infected to uninfected parts via the apoplast. The transport of SA into apoplastic space is likely facilitated by the proton gradient generated upon deprotonation of SA. The apoplastic SA transport is regulated by the transpirational pull and partitioning of SA between the symplast and cuticle. Distal transport of SA is essential for systemic acquired resistance.
1863,Vaccine preventable diseases including measles and mumps have been re emerging in countries with sustained high vaccine coverage . For mumps waning immunity has been recognized as a major contributor to recent outbreaks . Although unvaccinated individuals account for most cases in recent measles outbreaks the role of immune waning remains unclear . Accumulating serological and epidemiological evidence suggests that natural immunity induced by infection may be more durable compared to vaccine induced immunity . As the proportion of population immunity via vaccination gradually increases and boosting through natural exposures becomes rare risk of outbreaks may increase . Mechanistic insights into the coupled immuno epidemiological dynamics of waning and boosting will be important to understand optimal vaccination strategies to combat VPD re emergence and achieve eradication .,Vaccine preventable diseases VPDs have been re emerging despite sustained high vaccine coverage. Vaccine induced immunity may wane more rapidly compared to immunity induced by natural infection but this may differ depending on the target. Mumps re emergence appears linked to waning vaccine immunity known as secondary vaccine failures. Although outbreaks remain concentrated among unvaccinated clusters measles re emergence may also be associated with waning immunity. Further research incorporating immunological and epidemiological data are critical to determine best means for preventing VPD re emergence.
1864,A common characteristic of virus capsids is icosahedral symmetry yet these highly symmetric structures can display asymmetric features within their virions and undergo asymmetric dynamics . The fields of structural and computational biology have entered a new realm in the investigation of virus infection mechanisms with the ability to observe symmetry breaking features . This review will cover important studies on icosahedral virus structure and dynamics covering both symmetric and asymmetric conformational changes . However the main emphasis of the review will be towards recent studies employing cryo electron microscopy or molecular dynamics simulations which can uncover asymmetric aspects of these systems relevant to understanding viral physical chemical properties and their biological impact .,Symmetry breaking events in icosahedral viruses are important for infection. Advances in cryo EM technology has enabled asymmetric virus structure determination. Current MD simulations can compute full capsid dynamics on nss timescales. Further integration of modeling and experimental data will advance drug discovery.
1865,African horse sickness is a devastating disease caused by African horse sickness virus and transmitted by arthropods between its equine hosts . AHSV is endemic in sub Saharan Africa where polyvalent live attenuated vaccine is in use even though it is associated with safety risks . This review article summarizes and compares new strategies to generate safe and effective AHSV vaccines based on protein virus like particles viral vectors and reverse genetics technology . Manipulating the AHSV genome to generate synthetic viruses by means of reverse genetic systems has led to the generation of potential safe vaccine candidates that are under investigation .,New AHSV vaccines are being developed to improve efficacy and safety. Plasmid based or RNA transcript based RG systems have been developed for AHSV. RG is applied to design promising strategies for AHSV immunization. ECRA and DISC are the main vaccine platforms to produce vaccines based on defective AHSV.
1866,A standardized website evaluation model is needed in the tourism sector . This research article aims at revising previous models and updating them to contribute with a unified evaluation model for the analysis of web quality that incorporates a three dimensional approach on usability since usability is closely related to graphic design and navigability . This perspective has not been stated before . To test this correlation a model to evaluate User Usable Experience which integrates this three dimensional approach on usability is proposed and a set of indicators that have been devised from a close bibliographic revision of previous web analysis models is shown . Its application to a purposive sampling verifies the positive correlation among the three above mentioned parameters by means of a multiple linear regression model . The results confirm the need to analyse UUX from a three dimensional perspective on usability .,A multidisciplinary model for evaluating User Usable Experience UUX in tourism websites is proposed. The proposed model combines previous contributions and updates them in the context of the web 2.0. The positive correlation among usability graphic design and navigability is verified multiple linear regression model . Graphic design and navigability affect UUX in websites when they both work together not independently. Hints to check and improve UUX in tourism websites.
1867,This study aims to provide a theoretical framework explaining how tourists revisit intentions to home based accommodations are formed . It does so by inserting constructs related to co creation experience into the theory of planned behavior and by considering the moderating effect of co creation behavior . The study results,This study developed an extended TPB in a context of home based accommodation. Experiencescape perceived value and memorability were added into original TPB. Moderating impact of co creation behavior was identified.
1868,Tourism destination competitiveness is a multidimensional concept that is widely studied in the academic literature but multiple factors make its measurement a difficult task . In this article we design a synthetic index to rank the 80 countries that attract the majority of international tourists by level of tourism competitiveness . In order to do this we use all of the simple variables included in the 2017 Travel Tourism Competitiveness Index proposing a new methodology for the construction of this synthetic index which it solves the problems of aggregation of variables expressed in different measures arbitrary weighting and duplicity of information issues that remain unresolved by the TTCI . Likewise we analyse the most influential dimensions in tourism competitiveness . Air transport infrastructures cultural resources and ICT readiness are the key dimensions that explain the main disparities .,This paper proposes construction of a synthetic index to classify 80 countries by the level of tourism competitiveness. The new synthetic index uses the variables included in the 2017 Travel Tourism Competitiveness Index TTCI . A new methodology is applied to construct this synthetic index that solves the main problems of the TTCI. We identified the key pillars or dimensions in tourism competitiveness. Results reveal that the most competitive countries attract more international tourists.
1869,This study empirically investigated the effects of temporal construal upon the compromise effect the extent to which the importance of price and quality attributes to selecting a compromised option changed over time and the malleability of the influence of the temporal construal heuristic by changing the time parameters . Three hundred and ninety four questionnaires were used for further data analysis . The study s results suggested that the compromise effect was present in the tourism context but with weakened effectiveness when the time frame in which the purchase can be used was moved back . The importance of price and quality was different between those groups who selected each of three options . The importance of price level in selecting a middle option was not different in terms of temporal construal but the quality level was a more important consideration in selecting a middle option for future use than for use today .,The compromise effect was present but with weakened effectiveness when the time frame was moved back. The importance of price and quality was different between those groups who selected each of three options. The importance of price level in selecting a middle option was not different in terms of temporal construal. The quality level was a more important consideration in selecting a middle option for future use than for use today.
1870,Wine tourism in Italy the largest wine producing country in the world has achieved outstanding performance over recent years . However various institutional managerial and professional delays in the field impede Italy from developing its full potential as a wine tourism destination most likely because of the still unsatisfactory engagement of all possible stakeholders . A recent step forward has been the specific amendment regarding wine tourism provided by the 2018 Budget Law anticipating regulatory norms for the sector . In this scenario Italian wine routes established by Law No . 268 1999 and consolidated by the law on vines and wine should play a key role in the governance and management of the local wine tourism industry . However the state of the industry presents opportunities and challenges . Our research contributes to exploring this scenario providing evidence from the field and potential guidelines for development through territorial stakeholders engagement .,Wine tourism is a key opportunity for diversification strategies in the wine business. Wine routes can provide a great contribution to wine tourism expansion. Interaction and cooperation among wine routes stakeholders are essential. Wine routes in Italy evidence opportunities and challenges in their functioning success. Public private collaboration seems to be a vital issue for Italian wine routes progress.
1871,The travel industry has witnessed remarkable development of the children s market in recent decades however relevant academic research remains scarce especially with younger children . By adopting a netnographic approach this study explores young children s holiday experiences through the eyes of their parents . Research findings revealed parents preferred types of destinations for family vacations . Two broad themes were identified from analyses of parents accounts enjoyment of nature and social development . Findings are discussed in the context of relevant literature and industry recommendations are provided .,The study is one of the first attempts to explore the vacation experiences of children aged 04. Using data collected via netnography approach detailed account of parents were analyzed. Two broad themes emerged from the analysis enjoyment of nature and social development. The boundary between home environment and tourism destination is blurred for families traveling with young children. Children are active agent in the consumption of tourism space.
1872,Tourism literature has presented the effects of leadership style on staff efficiency yet few have examined the causal relationship between leadership style and newcomer outcomes at the hotel workplace context . This study examined the underlying mechanism regarding how transformational leadership can facilitate hotel newcomers to exhibit better performance and retention . Using the structural equation model this study tested research hypotheses using valid data collected from 234 hotel newcomers with their supervisors from 63 tourist hotels rated above four star in Taiwan . Based on emotion in feedback system theory this study noted that hotel newcomers displayed higher supervisor triggered positive affect due to the transformational leadership of their supervisors . In turn this led to newcomers high performance and motivation to continue working . Adapting social exchange theory this study found that transformational leadership has led to the development of a higher perceived supervisor support which facilitated better performance among newcomers at hotel organizations .,Given that hotel managers want newcomers to quickly adjust to the workplace and contribute to the hotel organization in less time this study suggests transformational leadership skills as an effective way to improve newcomer performance and increase employee retention. Using the concept of emotion in feedback system theory this study noted that hotel newcomers displayed high levels of supervisor trigger positive affect due to the transformational leadership. In turn this led to newcomers high performance and motivation to continue working. On the basis of social exchange theory this study also found that transformational leadership has led to a higher degree of perceived supervisor support which facilitated better performance among newcomers in a hotel organization.
1873,This paper explores the association between brand importance and growth in museum visitors . We analyzed 10years of online forum discussions and applied the Semantic Brand Score to assess the brand importance of five European Museums . Our Naive Bayes and regression models indicate that variations in the combined dimensions of the SBS are aligned with changes in museum visitors . Results suggest that in order to attract more visitors museum brand managers should focus on increasing the volume of online posting and the richness of information generated by users around the brand rather than controlling for the posts overall positivity or negativity .,We analyzed 10years of online conversations from the TripAdvisor travel forum. We used the Semantic Brand Score to measure brand importance of 5 European museums. Variations in brand importance were aligned with changes in museum visitors. Sentiment was not relevant for predicting change in museum visitors.
1874,Both the theory of planned behaviour and the health belief model are important theories to analyse health related behaviours however few studies have combined these theories to explore health risk issues in the tourism context . This paper explores the relationships underlying travelers health beliefs attitudes self efficacy preventative behaviours and travelling satisfaction during trips to high altitude destinations . Tibet in China was chosen as the case and the data are analysed by Mplus 7.4 with the WLSMV estimator . The results show that perceived susceptibility and perceived benefit can be regarded as important antecedent beliefs in attitudes toward preventative behaviours health beliefs and self efficacy positively influence preventative behaviours and there are significant indirect relationships from health beliefs to preventative behaviour . Moreover risk preventative behaviour is found to be a positive determinant of travelling satisfaction during a trip . Findings also revealed that TPB can be supported and extended by combining constructs of HBM .,Health beliefs are important antecedents of preventative behavior. There are significant indirect relationships from health beliefs to preventative behavior via attitude. Preventative behavior is a positive determinant of travelling satisfaction. The TPB and HBM are combined to understand tourist risk preventative behavior and travelling satisfaction. The TPB is extended by combining constructs of HBM.
1875,Drawing from knowledge management theory this study examines the relationships between employee s propensity to trust organic organizational structure knowledge sharing behavior and service innovation in a multivariate nexus in restaurants . Data from 180 restaurants with a total of 453 employees were used to test the research hypotheses via partial least square structural equation modelling . As expected the results of the empirical analysis revealed that propensity to trust is positively related to knowledge sharing behavior organic organizational structure and service innovation and knowledge sharing behavior is positively related to organic organizational structure and service innovation . Further this study established that both knowledge sharing behavior and organic organizational structure serially mediates the positive effect of propensity to trust on service innovation . The result of importance performance analysis highlights propensity to trust as the highest important predictor of service innovation while knowledge sharing is the best performance factor for service innovation in restaurants .,The effects of propensity to trust and knowledge sharing on employees service innovation are examined. Organic structure and knowledge sharing behavior serially mediate the effect of propensity to trust on innovation. A total of 453 restaurant employees in Nigeria participated. Propensity to trust is the most important predictor of innovation but knowledge sharing is the highest performance indicator.
1876,Survival of the hospitality and tourism industry is highly dependent on a stable workforce to service the tourists and customers .

1877,This paper analyses the impact of online reviews on hotel booking intention . The moderating effect of brand image star category and price on this relationship was also tested . A quantitative approach has been followed by collecting questionnaires from a convenience sample of 432 customers who have previous experience with online booking . Results of the research revealed that reviews with positive valence do not affect booking intention while reviews with negative valence have a strong impact . In addition it was found that several moderators made this impact more or less severe . Brand image demonstrated a slight moderating effect due to the factor s inherent subjective nature . A moderating effect was also observed for both price importance and star category on the relationship . In conclusion this study emphasizes the need for hotel managers to address online customer reviews and specifically negative ones to take advantage of promotional opportunities .,Customers hotel booking intentions are highly influenced by negative reviews while positive reviews have no impact. Importance of brand image star category and price moderate the impact of negative reviews on booking intention. Hotel managers must address online reviews and other factors as well.
1878,Academics and practitioners have focused on the importance of film induced tourism for destination marketing . Although the relationship between authenticity and destination loyalty has been evidenced few studies have explored the psychological mechanism through which authenticity influences destination loyalty . The present study fills the research gap by considering the role of celebrity attachment . The statistical analyses conducted in this study included confirmatory factor analysis correlation analysis structural equation modeling mediation analysis and bootstrapping analysis . Data from 354 purposeful film tourists revealed that constructivist authenticity had a positive effect on existential authenticity but no direct influence on destination loyalty . Existential authenticity had a direct influence on destination loyalty . Celebrity attachment mediated the influences of constructivist and existential authenticity on destination loyalty . Therefore celebrity attachment is a crucial mediator between authenticity and film destination choices for purposeful film tourists . Finally existential authenticity had a stronger influence on destination loyalty than did constructivist authenticity .,Constructivist authenticity has a positive effect on existential authenticity. Existential authenticity has a direct influence on destination loyalty. Celebrity attachment mediates the authenticity destination loyalty relationship. This study contributes to how authenticity links to film destination decision.
1879,Investments in information technology by the hotel sector are becoming increasingly important . However it is necessary to analyse the extent to which IT contributes to hotels being agile in responding to changes in the environment . The paper analyses the mediating and moderating role of IT capability in the relationship between IT uses and hotel agility . Results demonstrate the mediating role of IT capability confirming IT uses affect organisational agility not only directly but also indirectly by improving the ability to manage technological resources . However the role of IT capability as a moderator is not confirmed in this research . Such findings provide guidance to hotel managers to improve IT management and applications suggesting future lines of research .,Uses of information technology IT affect the hotel agility. Organisational agility is influenced by IT capability. IT capability mediates the effect of IT uses on hotel agility. IT capability does not have a moderating role from this research.
1880,Research on collaboration relationships among researchers assists in understanding scientific information dissemination . Network analysis has been used in many studies on collaboration . However understanding the co authoring communities in collaboration networks and identifying their key researchers generally remain unexplored although these insights can lead to an improved comprehension of collaboration relationships . The current study discovers and analyzes co authoring communities in the collaboration networks of researchers in tourism research . Results indicate that productivities within co authoring communities are high because of dense collaboration relationships . We also observe that location may be one of the formation reasons of co authoring communities . Key researchers who are globally and locally important can be further identified by introducing the community centrality measure . The network robustness test demonstrates the effectiveness of this measure .,Collaboration relationships in tourism research are studied using network analysis. Co authoring communities are discovered with structural community detection method. The community centrality measure is introduced to identify key researchers.

1882,Although recent studies have focused on the role of well being in tourism there is limited knowledge about its specific contribution for marketing practitioners . This study focuses on how cruise companies can develop a solid relationship with their passengers by examining four dimensions of experiential value and their impact on well being and passengers value co creation behavior . Experiential value consists of four dimensions playfulness aesthetics consumer return on investment and service excellence . A structural equation model delineating relationships among experiential value well being and value co creation was developed and tested with 292 luxury cruise passengers . Well being was found to play a significant role in linking the theoretical concepts of experiential value and value co creation with brand prestige playing a moderating role .,Playfulness service excellence and CROI positively influenced customer well being. Interestingly aesthetic value is no longer a primary value for quality of life. Brand prestige was used as a moderator in the evaluation of a cruise trip. Value co creation was the result of experiential value and customer well being.
1883,Visiting friends and relatives travellers have often been categorised based on their purpose of travel and their use of accommodations . This study focuses on the non VFR category defined by these two factors and on the investigation of hidden VFR travellers in the non VFR category . A total of 500 Japanese participants who met their friends or relatives in five major English speaking destinations completed an online survey . Using the two criteria 164 were categorised as VFRs whereas the others were grouped into the non VFR category . Among the non VFR travellers there was a group that shared similar characteristics with the VFR travellers . The result implies that there are HVFRs in the non VFR category . To expand the current understanding and concept of VFR travellers this study proposes an additional criterion for categorising VFR namely the influence of VFR hosts .,Travel purpose and accommodation type cannot define some VFR travellers. The influence of VFR hosts is an additional VFR definitional factor. The influence of VFR hosts excavates hidden VFR travellers. Approximately 25 of the non VFRs can be categorised as hidden VFR travellers. Hidden VFR travellers more often visit their friends than their relatives.
1884,Vulnerability and interaction between tourism and climate change are among the most important issues discussed recently .

1885,Tourist destinations as social ecological systems face growing challenges to build resilience to cope with various disruptions . This research explores how disadvantaged Indigenous communities in Taiwan especially those located in typhoon sensitive and geologically fragile areas developed resilience as tourist destinations . It applies empirical data from Indigenous River Closure a movement which aims to develop river ecotourism and build resilience in the face of growing uncertainty . The research applies mixed methods including in depth interview news archive review and participatory observation with an intention for primary data and secondary data to complement one another .,Disadvantaged people can collectively reclaim environmental rights restore natural resources and develop ecotourism. The success of RC requires adaptability to outside factors including politics and social and environmental issues. The level of reorganization and transformability villagers demonstrated reveals how RC enhances resilient ecotourism. The success of exogenous RC initiatives depends on their inherent social capital as well as the endogenous approach.
1886,Positive psychology provides an approach to understand different aspects of tourist s well being . This study investigated the wellbeing associated with snow sport tourism among women . As part of a larger mixed methods study the utility of the PERMA framework as a tool for measuring well being in the context of active sport tourism was assessed . Subsequently PERMA was applied to investigate the well being of female snow sport participants in relation to their sport related travel . Principle Component Analysis revealed only one dimension for well being instead of the previously suggested five PERMA domains . One way ANCOVA indicated that women who travelled to participate in snow sports had a higher sense of well being than those who participated locally . Hierarchical Multiple Regression showed a positive relationship between shorter frequent trips and higher well being . Recommendations for encouraging participation in snow sport tourism focusing on well being are made .,Well being items load on one factor in the snow sport tourism context. Women who travel to participate in snow sports acquire a higher well being than local participants. There is a positive relationship between shorter frequent snow sport trips and higher well being.
1887,This study investigates the determinants of inward Foreign Direct Investment stock in the French hospitality industry . A panel gravity model is applied to bilateral inward FDI stock between France and nineteen investor countries in Hotels and the Restaurant industry over 20002017 . Results show that bilateral inward FDI stocks between France and investor countries are positively affected by their income and are inversely proportional to the distance between them . It is also found that differentials between France and the investing countries in terms of taxes labour costs abundance of skilled labour supply of public goods and total FDI stock also play a significant role in understanding the foreign location decisions . Finally the results show that France is particularly successful in attracting FDI in the hospitality industry from French speaking countries with a common border and cultural proximity to France .,We analyse the determinants of FDI stock in the French tourism sector. A panel gravity model is applied to Hotels and Restaurant industry over 20002017. FDI activity showed to be sensitive to cost factors such as labour costs and taxes.

1888,This study compares the perspectives of government agencies academic experts and tourism suppliers on providing tourists with tsunami risk information . Previous studies highlight that government agencies are often in charge of developing tourism oriented risk communication plans academic experts are recognized as having a more in depth understanding of the technical aspects of a risk as well as the hazard development and potential effects and tourism suppliers play a fundamental role during the risk communication process due to direct connection with the tourists . However tourists are often found to be insufficiently informed about risks and warning systems . We use the Mental Models approach aiming to analyze the communication between the aforementioned categories of stakeholders . We carried out interviews and conducted field trips in Japan between April and December of 2018 . Results highlight an increased general awareness regarding tourists preparedness poorly supported by risk communication gaps misperceptions and a lack of efficacy analyses .,Risk communication Informing tourists to increase their disaster preparedness during the emergency phase. Perspectives of governmental organizations academic experts and tourism suppliers. A mental models approach to evaluate compare and identify communication gaps and misperceptions. Barriers and opportunities to improve risk communication to tourists.
1889,Tourism resilience studies often focus on a single shock event . In reality the same destination may face different kinds of shocks . It is important to compare the relative effect and resilience to different shocks .,We study the effect of shocks on domestic and foreign tourism in 22 Indian states. Natural disasters have a significant negative effect on foreign tourists. Severity of political conflict significantly negatively affects domestic tourists. More states suffered breaks in foreign compared to domestic tourist arrival trends. Time to recover from shocks was typically larger for foreign tourist arrivals.
1890,The concept of sustainability has been widely accepted in tourism to mitigate the detrimental effects of mass tourism . However developing a valid scale and testing it in cross cultural settings is critical in evaluating sustainable tourism outcomes . This study examines the validity of the Sustainable Tourism Attitude Scale in an Eastern island context . We adopted competing models testing cross cultural validity examination and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses . Data were collected from three archipelagoes in Taiwan . A seven correlated factor model was identified as the best fitting model . Cross cultural validity demonstrates that SUS TAS shares the same psychometric properties originally found in Choi and Sirakaya and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses support the concept that SUS TAS has the same cognitive framework across the three groups . The findings suggest that SUS TAS can be used to assess resident attitudes toward sustainable tourism in an Eastern island context . Implications for future research and managerial practice are discussed .,Cross cultural validity of the Sustainable Tourism Attitude Scale SUS TAS tested. Cross cultural validity of SUS TAS confirmed in an eastern islands Taiwan sample. Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses MGCFA found SUS TAS to have measurement invariance across islands. SUS TAS confirmed a tool for managers to assess resident attitude of sustainable tourism in an eastern island context.
1891,The current literature on volunteering in tourism is very Western centric and volunteering in different cultural contexts needs to be further explored . This study is devoted to exploring the local understanding of tourism related issues in China so as to give critical tourism by engaging local epistemology . Through a qualitative design this research explores how volunteering is conceptualized in the context of tourism in China . Findings identify that the highlight of voluntary spirit serving others by giving time skills knowledge and mutual help are three dimensions of conceptualization . It indicates that there are different meanings of volunteering in the Chinese context . This research takes a further step and reflects the applicability of the Western conceptualization of volunteering in the Chinese tourism context . This research presents a contribution to the epistemological decolonisation of tourism knowledge production in Chinese context .,Eurocentric ways of conceptualization is problemtised. The Chinese context volunteering. is explored. Three key dimensions of conceptualization are identified. It indicates that there are different meanings of volunteering in the Chinese context. It contributes to the epistemological decolonisation of tourism knowledge.
1892,Resilient tourism organisations and destinations can adapt and prosper in changing environments . Social networking and community engagement contribute to self organisation a typical element of resilient systems . In this context the present work aims at assessing the role of two of the main factors that contribute to the development of resilience in tourism organisations their preparedness to crisis and their participation in the destination s crisis management plans . To this end quantitative data was collected through a survey with 72 hotel managers in Galicia Spain a region that is frequently afflicted by natural disasters namely forest fires and oil spills . A logistic regression model has shown that planning to change and broadening participation increase organisations ability to capitalise on opportunities that arise in an uncertainty situation . Therefore in times of unpredictability more flexible organisations are better able to adapt and transform themselves in response to internal and external changes .,Social networking and community engagement contribute to self organisation. The ability to seize opportunities is a good measure of organisations resilience. Planning to change and broadening participation increase organisations ability to capitalise on opportunities that arise in an uncertainty situation. DMOs must stimulate organisations preparedness and their participation in the destination s planning process.
1893,With the growing popularity of peer to peer accommodation worldwide this conceptual paper reviews and explores Chinese users P2P accommodation experiences from a cultural perspective .

Hotel guests in notable Taiwan locations were surveyed via the Internet,This study builds a value co destruction model. Positive change in negative emotion positively affects negative eWOM. Desire for revenge is a mediator between negative emotion and negative eWOM. Desire for revenge is a mediator between negative emotion and negative eWOM.
1895,Tourism development is considered a key accompanying strategy in creating alternative livelihood options for the communities living in and adjacent to the Marine Protected Areas . This paper examines the socioeconomic characteristics of the Nha Trang Bay protected area to determine the factors that influence the decision to participate in tourism sectors and analyse whether these decisions would help to improve the economic wellbeing of the local communities . Using a mixed method approach including a strategic model and analysis of household surveys the paper shows that tourism development has not yet helped to improve economic well being of the communities as was expected . The primary factors that prevent local residents from participating in the tourism industry are low levels of education long distances between homes and tourism destinations and perceptions of the effects of tourism . Thus improving education and supporting the communities to meet multiple social and ecological goals should be a priority policy .,Tourism is booming in many coastal provinces in Vietnam. Marine Protected Areas often have multiple objectives and offer tourists many opportunities. The perception of tourism effects on society and environment plays a key role in communities living adjacent to MPAs. Contemporary tourism mechanisms have not yet helped to improve the economic wellbeing of the coastal communities. Improving community education and community based ecotourism is a possible priority solution.
1896,This empirical research deepens the current knowledge of tourism destination images by conceptualizing the effects of sun sand and sea tourism . The study investigates its impact on tourist attitude toward 3S tourism . This project also examines the impact of attitudes toward 3S tourism on visit intentions and word of mouth intentions as two behavioral outcomes . The study focuses on the mental representations of 3S tourism by tourists . Destination images can be defined operationalized and measured in a variety of ways this study investigates the images and attitudes held by tourists toward 3S tourism in Cyprus along with their desired behavioral responses . In the study 410 survey questionnaires were administered to tourists during the summer of 2017 . The results revealed that images of 3S tourism had a positive impact on tourist attitudes . Visit intentions and word of mouth intentions were enhanced by improving tourists attitudes toward 3S tourism .,3S sun sea and sand attribute plays an important role as a determining factor in tourists motivation to visit a destination. 3S tourism is a leading attribute for island destinations. Destination managers and planners should appreciate 3S tourism attribute and sustain a high quality 3S resources.
1897,This experimental study addresses the effect of a destination promotional video on tourists perceptions attitudes and intent to visit that destination depending on the viewing mode of the video traditional versus semi immersive . Two approaches were used to examine this effect self reported cognitive evaluations obtained via questionnaires and psychophysiological measures such as galvanic skin response and heart rate . The context of this study was the country of Bahrain . Fifty eight people participated in the experiment and were randomly assigned to either traditional or semi immersive group . The study found that the overall effect of the promotional video was quite large however the viewing mode was not a factor in the effect of the video . The study also found that psychophysiological measures and self reported measures were not in complete agreement with each other . Both affective and cognitive appraisals were responsible for the posttest change in participants perceptions and overall attitude toward the destination .,The impact of a promotional video on attitude toward a destination is examined using experimental design. Self reported and psychophysiological measures are used in two viewing settings desktop and immersive. The impact is examined using self reported and psychophysiological measures. Galvanic skin response GSR and heart rate HR are monitored with sensors. The change in attitudes does not depend on the setting. Affective response captured with sensors is part of self reported appraisals.
1898,Conferring to the leader member exchange theory and social exchange theory as the guiding basis this inquiry attempts to investigate the mechanism of how servant leaders are able to enhance and elevate the level of psychological capital among frontline employees in the hospitality setting . Data was gathered from 193 frontline employees in two different waves through a two week time lag from five star hotels in North Cyprus . The results proved that servant leader is able to enhance person group fit and person supervisor fit which in turn affect employees PsyCap . The results further suggested that both P G fit and P S fit both functions as a mediator in the relationship between servant leadership and PsyCap . The abovementioned relationships were assessed using structural equation modeling . Implications for managers as well as directions for future research are also discussed in this study .,Servant leaders will enhance the level of person group and person supervisor fit among hotel frontline employees. person group and person supervisor fit are positively and directly related to employee psychological capital. The two mentined fits mediate the relationship between servant leadership and employee psychological capital.
1899,Along with its open door policy and economic reforms wealth accumulation in China has experienced tremendous growth in a short time . Notably a group of new rich has emerged in the process of wealth and social reconfiguration . Being rich creates tremendous possibilities for individuals to tailor their leisure activities and lifestyles . Situating individuals travel in the overall spectrum of leisure this study explores the distinction practices adopted by China s new rich at leisure sites . Phenomenological interviews were conducted with 29 China s High Net Wealth individuals . The findings discover the spectrum of highbrowlowbrow tastes occurring at leisure sites with three patterns of leisure constructions conspicuous waste conspicuous taste and lifestyle . Supplementing Veblen and Bourdieu s traditions the study further deepens scholars comprehension of social distinction in tourism academia .,Elite social distinction is largely missing in current tourism scholarship. This study explores taste dynamics in the rich group of an emerging economy. The spectrum of highbrowlowbrow tastes of China s rich enhances scholars comprehension of social distinction in tourism academia
1900,This study examines the negative impacts of economic crises and disasters caused by weather or diseases on inbound tourists . We use two well known tourist cities Macao and Hong Kong to highlight the importance of economic variables in attracting tourists and the significant decreases in tourists when economic crises and disaster hit . Our results show that ignoring the impacts of crises will bias the statistical estimates . Using a simple dummy variable method we illustrate that the test results can change from insignificant to significant statistically . We find that different types of crises will have different degree of negative impacts on tourism industry which are important for policy makers and the tourism industry in crisis management and in overcoming the difficulties in attracting more tourists under very unfavorable conditions .,Key factors of tourism demand model for Macao and Hong Kong are identified. Dummy variables are important to estimate the tourism demand model correctly when crises happened in the sample period. SARS and subprime mortgage crisis have negative impact on tourism industry of Macao and Hong Kong. Typhoon Hato only has negative impact on tourism industry of Macao. The corruption in Mainland China and the opaque VIP gambling service in Macao created negative income effect in Hong Kong.
1901,Given the well documented increase in Chinese outbound tourists it is no surprise that the Chinese market continues to attract considerable scholarly interest . Previous studies have been primarily quantitative using methods and instruments administered prior to and or immediately after visitation . While useful such approaches may struggle to capture the complex cultural attributes of the Chinese market . Accordingly this paper proposes the adoption of high engagement methods namely Accompanied Walk and Visitor Employed Photography as additional in situ techniques for studying Chinese visitors . Drawing on fieldwork conducted at Ulu,Introduces high engagement approaches for studying Chinese tourists in situ. Shows Chinese outbound tourists have unique ways of perceiving tourism landscapes. Discusses strengths and challenges of high engagement approaches with examples. Provides strategies for using these techniques to study the Chinese market.
1902,The objectives of this research include studying the impact of low cost carriers on the spending behaviour of the tourists at a given destination . To accomplish these objectives we examined the allocation of tourist expenditures to different travel associated expenses and its determinants in the Azores islands and compared the situation before and after the airline liberalization . We considered that socio demographic and trip related characteristics influence spending behaviour .,When low cost carriers start operating in a market the main determinants of expenditure composition vary significantly. The effect of age on expenditures was augmented by low cost operation with younger visitors spending less. The effect of nationality on the expenditure varied considerably when LCCs started operating in the market. The type of accommodation chosen by the tourist has a higher influence on the tourist expenditures after liberalization. The people the tourists travelled with affected expenditures before and after LCCs started operating in the market.
1903,This paper examines the current state of research on well being from tourism from the lens of positive psychology . A systematic review of 82 peer reviewed articles published in English language tourism journals indicate that tourist well being is predominantly examined as a consequence of travel rather than linked to tourism marketing and management . This study presents a conceptual framework of the antecedents episodes and consequences of tourist well being . Practically results suggest strategies on how well being can be used to generate better outcomes for tourism marketers and managers . By mapping what is known in the intersection between positive psychology and tourist well being this study identifies existing gaps and opportunities for future research in this area .,This paper has shown that the platform of tourism scholarship that directly explores tourist well being is not well established. This paper contributes a conceptual framework on the antecedents episodes and consequences of tourist well being and. This paper suggests practical strategies on how well being can be used to generate better outcomes for tourism marketers and managers.
1904,The disruption in destinations caused by the emergence of new forms of tourist distribution within the framework of the sharing economy gives rise to new challenges in terms of competitiveness regulation and even investment . This article studies the determining factors that influence consumer decisions in the choice of rental accommodation using both ordinary least square models and quantile regression estimation techniques . The results show the greater interpretative capacity of the QR which reveals certain overlooked patterns of the relationship between some of the characteristics of the properties the hosts or the socioeconomic environment and the price paid by the users . These results can facilitate decision making in the destinations by companies society and the public sector .,This study improves the interpretative capacity of previous studie in sharing economy area. Quantile regression is more recommended than OLS in determining tourist accommodation preferences and pricing strategies. QR model is especially needed in the variables related to the characteristics of the property. Even if instability is not found in the trend of the coefficients QR allow a better understanding of the variables. A better interpretative capacity means better decisions for stakeholders in improving the destinations.
1905,There are shortcomings in studying tourist satisfaction from the direct effect of travel motivation . The current study constructed an integrated model of motivation satisfaction towards a heritage destination with the addition of experience related factors and destination image . Unlike previous studies mainly focusing on pre or after the experience this research employed a survey aiming at tourists during their on site experiences . By using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling the proposed structural model was tested with a sample of 352 visitors at Hoi An UNESCO World Heritage Site Vietnam . Motivation had significant effects on visitor engagement visitor experience and heritage destination image which in turn led to heritage tourists satisfaction . The indirect link between motivation and satisfaction was also confirmed contributing to a better understanding of the formation of satisfaction in the context of heritage tourism . Practical implications are provided for Destination Management Organizations of heritage sites .,Constructs a model of tourist satisfaction towards a heritage destination. Tests a structural model using PLS SEM. Validates the indirect relationship between motivation and satisfaction. Provides heritage destination organizations with practical implications.
1906,This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between crisis management procedures and local resilience responses . Utilizing the context of the 416 wildfire in southwest Colorado during the summer of 2018 this study proposes that community resilience is a process that is impacted by the decision making surrounding the reduction of the disaster impact . The results of this study argue that interpreting the community response to crisis management from the lens of resilience will allow decision makers to more thoroughly understand the impact on the community and the related tourism industry . This research proposes a path of integration between crisis management and community response to be used for navigating the challenges that occur during uncontrolled natural disasters impacting community sustainability .,Practices that impact resilience will prioritize emphasis on the local people the economy and the local environment. Resilience processes are related to the development of timely communication evolution of a collective community and acceptance of the space after the disaster. Two distinct time frames of the resiliencew process need to be identified for a sustainable community to prevail.
1907,Further longitudinal and empirical studies of destination management organisations are needed to enhance our understanding of tourists engagement management via social networking sites . In the context of European local DMOs and exploring a timeframe of 6years this paper provides evidence of a positive trend in tourists online engagement . However greater effort in managing SNS must be made prioritising interactive conversations . Seasonality exists more online interaction takes place during the off season than in the peak season . The successful management of SNS requires careful attention to the content format and timing of posts and to the expression of sentiments . Emphasis should be placed on the natural resources of the destination on the use of video formats on the expression of positive sentiments and on making posts during weekends in the evening and at night .,Tourists online engagement via Facebook with local DMOs has increased. Tourists online engagement varies between peak and off season periods. Posts on a destination s natural resources foster tourists online engagement. Posts with videos and made out of working hours foster tourists online engagement. Posts expressing positive sentiments foster tourists online engagement.
1908,Psychological capital of tourism business owners and managers in the face of adversity has received scant attention . This study explores how the four components of PsyCap affect organizational resilience in a post quake environment . Using a case study approach and in depth interviews with small tourism business owners and managers in Kaikoura New Zealand we found that problem focused and emotion focused coping mechanisms enabled participants to activate PsyCap components to build organizational resilience . Realistic optimism of owners and managers for example fuelled problem focused coping strategies that led to greater situation awareness of changes in both the internal and external business environment . The findings have implications for small tourism businesses as they navigate the recovery process following major disasters .,Offers an understanding of psychological capital in a post disaster context. Examines the coping mechanisms employed by small tourism business owners and managers. Offers an understanding of how coping affects organizational resilience. Shows how hope optimism self efficacy and psychological resilience affect business recovery

Despite the important role of digital storytelling in consumer persuasion research on the effect of digital storytelling on consumer behavior is scarce in the visitor economy crowdfunding sector . The objective of this work is to create and verify a theoretically integrated research framework including three dimensions of digital storytelling as a reflective second order factor and concepts of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology . Results reveal that digital storytelling has highly significant effects on facilitating condition performance expectancy effort expectancy and social influence in descending order . Investors intention to crowdfund is also significantly affected by facilitating condition performance expectancy social influence and effort expectancy in descending order offering significant theoretical and managerial implications in leisure and tourism .,Crowdfunding is an increasingly significant source of capital in the visitor economy. Digital storytelling is an emerging factor in tourism crowdfunding in the UTAUT. Digital storytelling plays a significant role in funders intention to crowdfund. Perceived esthetics is closely related to digital storytelling in crowdfunding. Facilitating condition has the most important role in crowdfunding digital storytelling.
1910,Storytelling represents an extensive and rich body of research in tourism . Prior studies mainly focus on tourists stories in understanding travel experiences and little knowledge exists as to whether destination promotional videos embed the principles of storytelling . Using the Heros Journey as a guiding framework this study conducts a narratological analysis of six destination brand commercials . The advertisements are deconstructed assessing their story structure story type archetype enactment and experiential outcome . Findings indicate that the majority of destination commercials fail to exhibit state of the art practices of storytelling and this represents a missed opportunity . The Heros Journey offers a useful tool to help destination marketers to develop powerful storytelling promotional videos that connect with and engage prospective tourists .,Stories permeate human life experiences. Storytelling ads convey brand values through emotion laden stories and engage tourists. Deconstructs six destination brand videos using an adapted Heros journey framework. Storytelling in destination brand promotional videos is still in its infancy. Failure to harness the value of storytelling represents a missed opportunity for DMOs.
1911,The purpose of this research is to explore the role of online photography in creating experience value in nature based tourism and what types of experience value are conveyed through photography based user generated content . The paper draws from existing literature in defining tourism experience value as a subjective inter subjective and inter contextual construct performed by situated valuation practices . Consequently the paper presents interpretive and participatory netnography as an effective method to investigate experience value and identifies online photography on Instagram as both a valuing practice and a valuing place . Results show the capability of online photography based UGC to create multidimensional values from strategic combinations of textual and visual content . Simultaneously new dimensions of experience value are introduced which exist beyond single tourism experiential encounters but critically contribute to an iterative experience valuation . Finally Instagram posts introduce valuation timelines that can elude linear models of pre in situ post experience valuation and assume subjective and fluid connotations .,On line photography is an important source for experience managers to learn from tourists. Using participatory netnography advances knowledge on value creation in tourism. Online photography can deliver valued sensorial elements other than sight. Utopian and eudemonic valuations of nature are reflected in tourists posts. Valuation processes are not temporally linear and personally signified
1912,The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of family firm specific non financial dynamics and family firm psychological capital on firm performance . We develop a model of how family firms SEW preservation goal negatively affects firm performance in terms of sales and the mitigating influence of FFPsyCap on this association . We test the model on a sample of 192 family firms in the Hospitality and Tourism industry . Using a cross sectional research design surveys were solicited from small and medium size hotels in Turkey . Ordinary Least Squares technique is used to test our hypotheses . The results reveal that family firms SEW preservation goal negatively affects firm performance in terms of sales and the FFPsyCap mitigates this influence . Accordingly if small and medium size firms in H T can capitalize on non financial strengths and minimize the impact of family centric goals on firm outcomes they can attain transgenerational sustainability and success .,A large portion of firms in the Hospitality and Tourism H T are family owned. Socioemotional wealth preservation impacts family firm sales negatively in the H T. Family Firm Psychological Capital mitigates the negative impact of SEW on sales. Family firm specific non financial dynamics can be an asset or liability. Valuable intangible assets can minimize the negative impact of family centric goals.
1913,Innovative processes in the tourism industry are usually defined by improving customer services and by investing in Information and communication technology . Tourism companies cooperate with developing countries and their attractiveness on the international tourism market as well as with communication of the image concept . New technologies facilitate the availability of tourism services by offering customer friendly services . Although the tourism business is considered as a pioneer in the adoption of new technologies studies have shown that new technologies often seem be inadequate and their impact assessment is not systematic . The aim of this research is to define the potential improvements of the e marketing within the tourism industry through the characterization of the importance of tourism innovation evaluation of the key e marketing communication tool preferences from the point of view of the Lithuanian tourism users . Overall 384 tourists were surveyed to achieve the research objective . Findings show that e marketing tools used in the Lithuanian tourism industry are effective although there are strategies that are not fully operational or not used at all .,New technologies in the tourism industry can offer customer friendly services. marketing tools are useful instruments for touristic communication management. The point of view of 384 Lithuanian tourism users is investigated. New tourism products are more successful than those without involving customers. E marketing tools are effective but there are areas for improvement.
1914,Academic discourse supporting the inclusion of spirituality in higher education has grown across many disciplines . Scholars are arguing for the integration of spirituality into the contemporary intellectual landscape . However the significance of spirituality to tourism higher education has not been adequately understood and little research has been undertaken .,Tourism educators held multi dimensional spiritual meanings which were subjectively constructed. The educators supported the role that spirituality can play due to the nature of the tourism industry and tourism higher education. The integration of the notion in tourism education is perceived to be distinctively challenging due to various constraints. Strategies proposed for the inclusion of spirituality in tourism higher education. These include garnering management support and bringing changes to curriculum and assessment.

1917,Starting from the latest studies which support the idea that the Merry Cemetery in Spna is a dark tourist attraction this article examines whether this idea is fully justified . The approach is based on a careful analysis of the literature and a rigorous study of the origins historical and cultural features as well as characteristics of the cemetery s uniqueness . The article uses a questionnaire applied throughout the year 2018 to the people who visited the cemetery to find out what it is associated with the reasons why they visited it and whether the visit was enjoyable or on the contrary macabre . While analysing the results and examining them according to the literature the article shows that the Merry Cemetery is perceived more as a place of folk culture and less as a dark tourist attraction . The experiences feelings and emotions of visitors are overwhelmingly positive in contrast to those specific to dark tourism . Research data shows that the elements that make it unique must play a greater role in changing the promotion paradigm and its management as a tourist destination .,The Merry Cemetery is a living creation that permanently enhances the power of the expression of folk culture. In Spna the imminence of death is. and ironically portrayed. Sadness is shadowed by the power of local naive culture and neutralized by humor and satire of the epitaphs. In this cemetery the visitors receive an important lesson namely that life and death must necessarily be celebrated. This cemetery is not a dark tourism site and must necessarily be promoted as a cultural attraction.
1918,Social media is an effective way to engage with an airline and many carriers include Facebook Youtube Twitter and Instagram as vital parts of their customer engagement strategies . The Facebook pages of four top airline companies that won the 2017 World Airline Awards have been used as the source of this study . The StimulusOrganismResponse model has been adopted . 281 posts were collected and analyzed by employing the thematic analysis method . The findings reveal that three out of four airline companies especially those with more company oriented tend to stir complaining customers cognitive and emotions regarding their flight experiences . The findings and recommendations offer airline companies a clearer picture about the airline passengers concerns and behavior in responding to the Facebook contents posted . Furthermore this study fills the gap in the existing studies which lack a framework to investigate how airline companies engage with airline passengers via Facebook posts .,The relevance of the types and contents of posts triggered greater negative responses. The airlines Facebook posts about company s achievements however customers reacted negatively. Types of posts stimuli have an influence on the Facebook users cognitions and emotions organism which leads to different behaviors responses . The top airline companies encountered a high volume of passengers negative responses.

1920,Given the minimal attention that researchers have given to how various stakeholders contribute to festival experiencescapes in destination settings this paper examines how an intangible cultural heritage experiencescape is constructed focusing on a local and national level listed heritage item in Macau . In depth stakeholder interviews are conducted to identify involvement in the event by government officials organizers performers shop owners and tourists . Organizers and performers were found to play key roles in delivering experiences and the researchers determined that participation by most visitors is spontaneous . Government plays a supporting and coordinating role with local community representatives engaging actively in operational aspects . The participation by local shop owners in creating the experiencescape is modest . This study contributes to knowledge by proposing an ICH experiencescape framework that conveys a multidimensional scape concept and shows the progressive formation and refinement of experiences before during and after visitation .,Literature on the experiencescape concept is extended into the ICH context. Most visitors participate in the festival spontaneously. Multiple stakeholders roles and interactions are identified and analyzed. A conceptual framework is proposed for the multidimensional scape concept. Experiencescape is an approach to interpret various dimensions of experience.
1921,The purpose of this study is to examine how emotions mediate the impact of a holistic servicescape physical and social on post consumption outcomes in the performing arts . Partial Least Square was conducted to test the mediation hypothesized relationships on a sample of 867 opera goers . The proposed research model was largely supported by the evidence and the mediating role of emotions was confirmed . Servicescape influences direct and indirectly attendees post consumption in opera given that emotions play a partial mediating role which is greater in the case of positive emotions . Based on the results this study offers specific theoretical and managerial implications concerning the importance of creating positive experiences through suitable servicescapes considering emotions .,Emotions mediate servicescape impact on post consumption outcomes. Creating positive servicescape experiences contributes to improving positive emotions. Servicescape has to be considered also by its social dimension. Findings suggest that mediation of positive emotions is greater than negative ones. Emotions mediating effect is particularly relevant in value perceptions.

The objective of this empirical study was considering the above assertation analyzing the segmentation of the demand for this kind of destination in terms of customer motivations . This project was an on site investigation conducted in the city of Salinas an important coastal and marine destination in Ecuador . The researchers used 385 questionnaires and analyzed them with multivariate statistical techniques . The results show six motivational factors Authentic coastal experience Heritage and nature Learning Novelty and social interaction Physical activities and Sun and beach . The study also shows the existence of two different segments of visitors . The first group labeled Beach lovers formed by tourists who have high motivation in such aspects related to the sun and the beach this group refers to the motivational dimension sun and beach . The second group labeled Multiple coastal motives grouped tourists who have high values in all the motivational dimensions . The findings of this research suggest the need for a more refined and complete brand that could attract not only beach lovers but also other segments of tourists motivated by the different activities and features that this coastal and marine destination can offer .,The study analyzes the motivations and segmentation in a coastal and marine destination. The city of Salinas is a destination with coastal and marine characteristics. Six motivations were identified related to the beach nature and culture. The segments found were Beach lovers and Multiple coastal motives. The segment Multiple coastal motives exhibits higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty
1923,This study researches both the perception of a destination and the importance of the previous visit in shaping that perception . First the factors that influence the image are analysed moderated by the effect of the previous visit . Next the gap between the projected image and the perceived image of Malaga which is located in a tourist area specializing in sun and beach and trying to become a cultural destination is studied . Data are obtained from 301 surveys administered through proportional and stratified sampling . A descriptive inferential analysis and a structural equation model are proposed to analyse the causal relationships . The results confirm the influence of information sources and motivations on the image as well as the importance of the previous visit . The conclusions suggest that there are significant difficulties in changing the Malaga image as a seaside destination for visitors but not for the local community .,Closing the gap between projected and perceived destination image is essential. Changing the consolidated image of a destination is very difficult. Previous visit is a significant factor in the destination image process. Motivation influences the cognitive image dimension more than a visit does. Information sources are highly significant in the decision to visit the first time around.

It elucidates how different personal traits with regard to food involvement matter in destination branding
1931,Lithium ion battery modeling for use in battery management systems requires models that can adapt to the changing behavior of a cell as it ages . One method to enable this adaptivity is to select the most representative model from a set of pre aged models that represent the characteristics of the cell as different cyclic and calendar aging processes occur . By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process an interacting multiple model Kalman filter can be utilized to determine a time varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation . While the output of the IMM is useful by itself its predictions can be improved by post processing . In this paper we present methods to analyze the time series probability mass function produced by the IMM using the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms in common use in the digital communications discipline . These algorithms seek to identify the best path through the space of available models over time based on the likelihoods produced by the IMM and the Markovian transition probabilities . Through the use of these post processing algorithms confidence in the best fitting model can be improved .,Physics based reduced order models enable battery management systems to limit aging. We propose an approach to select model from precomputed set that matches measurements. Method uses nonlinear interacting multiple model IMM Kalman filter to make selection. IMM outputs are postprocessed to improve model selection and therefore SOH accuracy. Results are guaranteed to be stable and physically meaningful.
1932,Recognizing the importance of the cost to the wider adoption of redox flow batteries it is critical to achieve the higher utilization of electrolytes and thus reduce the required electrolyte volume . Although the effects of the applied current on the battery performance were extensively explored in previous studies few of them investigated how to dynamically optimize the applied current with varying state of charge conditions during the charging process . A variable current strategy is proposed in the present study to dynamically vary the applied current density according to the real time state of charge conditions in a vanadium redox flow battery system . Both simulations and experiments are conducted to confirm the feasibility and practicality of the proposed strategy . The results show that the concentration overpotentials and ohmic losses can be reduced at relatively large or low state of charge conditions under the proposed strategy leading to a more than 10 increment in the effective energy capacity at the required power density compared to the constant current strategy . In addition the strategy is further improved by incorporating the variable flowrate which is shown to further enhance the performance of the battery system .,A variable current strategy for boosting effective energy capacities is proposed. Operating current density varies with varying state of charge conditions. Effective energy capacity can be enhanced over 10 at required power density. The practicability of the variable current strategy is verified through experiments. A strategy of variable current strategy combined with variable flowrate is proposed.
1933,The development of smart micro grids makes the use of new and green technologies like plug in electric vehicles more suitable . The plug in electric vehicles can play a role in storing energy due to their network connection capability . The smart micro grid can use this stored energy to reduce its operating cost . In this paper a new mechanism based on the contractual agreements between the owners of plug in electric vehicles and the smart micro grid is proposed to provide the system s energy during the operating day . The proposed model enables plug in electric vehicles parked in official parking to be integrated into the operation of smart micro grid and earn revenue .

1936,We examine resident perceptions of tap water organoleptic properties to identify overall satisfaction and consumption patterns in relation to social and economic inequality across urban neighborhoods in Palm Beach County FL . We surveyed randomly selected households and inquired in person at the residence about the organoleptic properties of their household tap water . A socioeconomic status index was created using Principal Components Analysis and KruskalWallis and MannWhitney tests were used to examine the differences in survey responses between SES groups . The results provide evidence that residents living in the lowest SES ranked neighborhoods are less satisfied with the organoleptic properties of their tap water and consume more bottled water than those living in the higher SES ranked neighborhoods . This paper explores socioeconomic disparities across Palm Beach County and assesses how organoleptic properties of tap water influence consumption patterns especially in poorer neighborhoods . Suggestions for future research include testing for tap water contaminants at the household by using resident descriptions of tap water aesthetics as a guide for sampling design . Additionally reducing secondary contaminants at the water treatment plant is recommended in order to promote tap water consumption and reduce reliance on bottled water .,Odor clarity and taste of tap water were rated lower in poorer households. Lower ranked SES households consume bottled water the most frequently. Improving tap water organoleptics may promote consumption and reduce plastic waste. Resident perceptions can help guide solutions for tap water improvements.
1937,Sustainability evaluation has been an important topic for politicians and professionals for the last few decades . A data envelopment analysis is a popular technique for evaluating the sustainability of decision making units . The traditional DEA models consider a DMU as black box thus ignoring the interactions among the different processes . This study proposes a new network data envelopment analysis model for evaluating the sustainability of high middle and low income countries . The proposed NDEA model allows us to evaluate sustainable production and distribution stages in a unified framework in the presence of both zero data and undesirable outputs . The results of our proposed model show that countries with high and low incomes perform well in the sustainable production stage but have a weak performance in the sustainable distribution stage . In contrast middle income countries have weak performance in the sustainable production stage but good performance in the sustainable distribution stage . Finally to identify countries strengths and weaknesses we also did a sensitivity analysis . Based on the results the paper proposes solutions for reducing inefficiencies in the sustainable production and distribution stages .,A network DEA model is proposed to evaluate sustainability of countries. The model allows to evaluate production and distribution stages. High and low incomes perform strong in production but weak in distribution. Middle income countries perform weak in production but strong in distribution. Solutions are proposed to reduce inefficiencies in each of the economic stages.
1938,Reducing post harvest losses permits the improvement of food security and food safety reduction of unnecessary resource use and increase of food supply chain actors profits . Most published studies have addressed the problem qualitatively mainly due to difficulty obtaining necessary data . This paper seeks to understand how macroeconomic conditions influence PHL of grains which are the main source of food for humans and animals through the construction of an econometric model using global level panel data from publicly available databases . Results suggest that increasing production to feed the increasing population often involves a difficult trade off . Some countries seeking on farm production gains lack post harvest infrastructure especially in food storage and food marketing which contribute to a sharp increase in the PHL level . There is also evidence that economic development non linearly reduces grains PHL in all dimensions .,Macroeconomic conditions influence post harvest losses PHL of grains. Increase in food production and increase in PHL per capita are directly correlated. Higher level of economic development of a country can bring a lower level of PHL. Lack of food storage and food marketing infrastructure can lead to higher PHL.
1939,Considering that one of the alternatives for transitioning to a circular economy is the adoption of new business models based on use performance instead of product ownership we focused this study on the adoption of product service systems . Specifically we identify the main drivers and barriers affecting the adoption of use oriented PSS by young consumers residing in medium and small cities . We opted to perform a descriptive research with a quantitative approach . We verified that environmental concern and healthy lifestyle are the main drivers for the adoption of use oriented PSS while unavailability of use oriented PSS in the region or city presented the greatest barrier to the adoption . Furthermore we conclude that drivers associated with hedonistic experiential needs as well as personal factors tend to positively incentivize the adoption of use oriented PSS . Notwithstanding situational factors as PSS availability and information about costs and usage methods can serve as inhibitors . Finally to assist managers and academics we propose a framework that summarizes the identified PSS adoption drivers and barriers along with recommendations to optimize adoption drivers .,environmental concern and healthy lifestyle are the main drivers to the adoption. difficulty in finding is the greatest barrier to the adoption. drivers associated with hedonistic needs tend to positively motivate the adoption. personal factors such as age tend to positively motivate the adoption. situational factors as availability and little information can serve as inhibitors.
1940,Appropriate supplier selection due to its direct impact on profitability and maintaining the competitive status of an organization is one of the vital decisions for each company . Data envelopment analysis is a proper tool for measuring the sustainability of suppliers . Classic DEA models suppose that inputs and outputs are deterministic consequently the relative efficiencies of suppliers are also deterministic . However in real life applications all inputs and outputs are not deterministic . Some could be stochastic and or fuzzy . This study consists of four types of supplier selection models in supply chains and provides a decision making scheme for selecting appropriate model for supplier selection under deterministic stochastic and fuzzy conditions . The proposed stochastic fuzzy DEA model can be solved as crisp program for each,It develops a new DEA model for performance evaluation of sustainable suppliers. The proposed model can fully rank all suppliers. The proposed model can handle uncertainty.
1941,Making an effective sustainability decision at every stage of a product life cycle is key to achieving a holistic sustainable product development . The extant literature highlights the challenges and lack of effective tools for determining the impact of manufacturing processes on the environmental economic and social dimensions as well as the interdependence of the outcome of one dimension on the other . This research paper identifies methodologies tools and approaches that can be integrated into a single descriptive framework to enable both assessment and analysis of the aspects of the three sustainability dimensions . The paper also details the development of the framework using inductive methods and conceptual synthesis of key sustainability approaches and a Delphi study involving panels of international researchers and practitioners in the field of sustainable manufacturing . The framework can provide a platform for both practitioners and sustainability analysts to build impact analysis models that will support effective sustainability decision making . It will also enable a clear perspective of the required elements processes and indicators that need to be considered in sustainable manufacturing design and assessments .,Framework for sustainability analysis developed through inductive and deductive analysis. Delphi study shows a consensus level of above 80 for each evaluation criteria. The framework is able to capture the aspects of the three sustainability dimensions. The framework supports LCSA principles and interdependence analysis.
1942,The purpose of this study is to clarify the patterns of influence of a firms environmental performance on its economic performance with consideration of sustainable consumption and production . It is well known that environmental performance generally influences economic performance through an improvement in the production process and an increase in demand . Thus it is expected that firms can enhance economic performance much more than previously thought by contributing to SCP . However because consumers customers can not directly observe a firms environmental performance its environmental performance should influence economic performance by improving the production process directly and increasing demand indirectly via disclosed environmental information . Furthermore the influence of environmental performance on economic performance should depend on the assumption of the nature of the relationship between them . This study develops a simple theoretical economic model to identify how a firms environmental performance influences economic performance and empirically tests the model using data on Japanese manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2015 . Our regression results prove that environmental performance enhances economic performance by improving the production process directly and increasing demand indirectly via disclosed environmental information . Specifically the former is a positive linear relationship and the latter is a U shaped relationship . Because these results support the view that firms can enhance economic performance by contributing to the SCP this study provides new insight into the ongoing debate about whether a firms environmental performance enhances its economic performance especially in the era of sustainable development goals .,Theoretical model of environmental and economic performance is empirically tested. Environmental disclosures mediate environmental and economic performance via demand. Environmental performance enhances economic performance via productivity and demand. Economic performance is enhanced linearly and non linearly via these paths. Sustainable consumption and production contribute to economic performance.
1943,With the increasing demand for fashion products the textile and apparel industry is facing huge challenges in resource management and environmental regulations . Fashion renting provides an option to reuse clothing products . Besides that it also fulfills an individuals fashion needs while reducing the production of new clothes . Though some studies have been done to examine consumers opinions of fashion renting most of these studies employed survey methods and did not utilize actual data of consumers real renting experiences . The purpose of this study is to evaluate consumers actual renting experiences and to identify the motivations and barriers for those consumers to rent fashion products . A data mining approach was applied in this study . Consumers comments on renting experiences from three fashion rental companies Rent the Runway Gwynnie Bee and Bag Borrow Steal were collected as a reliable data source to dig into and identify consumers motivations and concerns .

1944,Nurturing the global population without exceeding the carrying capacity of the earth is a challenge . Linking nutritional quality and environmental objectives is of high importance in a sustainable food context . Meals are not usually evaluated and classified based on their contribution to health and especially to environmental sustainability . Therefore we propose a methodology for the classification of meals based on environmental policy targets and nutritional recommendations . As a case study we analyzed 100 hot meals served in a university canteen in Belgium . Every meal contained three meal components . A life cycle assessment and a nutritional assessment based on the Weighted Nutrient Density Score were performed to evaluate the environmental impact and the nutritional value respectively . To classify the meals we introduced three reference values for both the environmental impact and the nutritional value . This corresponded to four environmental and four nutritional classes which results in 16 classes in total . The environmental reference values were based on the 2020 and 2030 European Commission targets on greenhouse gas emission reduction . The nutritional reference values were based on food recommendations from national public health authorities . Meals with fish had the best overall score and meals with ruminant meat had the worst score . Vegetarian meals had the best environmental score and similarly to ruminant meat meals the worst nutritional score . Further studies are needed to test the classification methodology for other meals and food items . Future research may focus on further optimization of the combined environmental and nutritional assessment especially for the classification of reference values . To conclude we developed a novel nutritional and environmental classification for meals based on environmental policy targets and nutritional recommendations .,Meals are classified based on environmental policy and nutritional recommendations. The classification includes 4 environmental and 4 nutritional classes 16 in total. Meals with fish had the best score and meals with ruminant meat the worst score.
1945,Modern manufacturing organizations have started giving paramount importance to sustainable aspects of the manufacturing processes realizingnot only that the natural resources are dwindling rapidly but also that they bear significant responsibility to the society and surroundings for the overall future development . Catastrophic failures and the maintenance of complex equipment can generate a large amount of hazardous waste within the organization that can affect the overall production level environment along with impacting the health of workers in the long run . Failure mode and effect analysis is an efficient risk analysis tool for processes products designs or services and has been adopted by different types of organizations . In this paper for the first time in the literature the consequences of failure modes of industrial equipment are considered from the sustainable point of view which is believed to be a requirement for the establishment of a successful sustainable manufacturing strategy .,A novel idea of FMEA is proposed to aid the practise of sustainable manufacturing. Severities are decoupled from the economical societal and ecological aspects. Integrating Interval Type 2 Fuzzy DEMATEL and Modified Fuzzy MAIRCA methods. Validation is carried out by using a novel case study of process plant gearbox.
1946,Resource optimization platforms appear as a valid option to more sustainable modes of consumption . The success of these platforms mostly depends on the capability to comprehend the potential users motives for engagement . We developed and tested a conceptual model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate the relative significance of consumer motives for and against using a peer to peer sharing platform . Qualitative interviews of an elicitation study followed a quantitative survey with potential users . The size of the demand for accessing specific products and services and the type of transaction mode preferred were also investigated . Attitude towards using a P2P sharing platform is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention among the TPB constructs . Ecological sustainability sense of belonging trust in other users and familiarity are the most critical factors determining the attitude towards using the potential platform process risk concerns were identified as the main hinder . There were more providers than takers to all likely items enquired and accommodation and car sharing had the most significant asymmetric ratios remarkably . Services in general and study materials were the items with the highest potential demand and supply . The preferred mode of exchange for the platform is a free system which includes donation and second hand sales and transfer of points or money . This study contributes to a better understanding of consumer motivations and desires to engage in sharing resources for sustainability transformations .,We investigated antecedents of behavioural intention in peer to peer resource sharing. An elicitation study n. 7 followed a quantitative survey n. 325 with potential platform users. Intention was strongly influenced by the attitude towards using the platform. Attitude was mainly determined by ecological sustainability sense of belonging and trust. We found large asymmetries in the willingness to provide and access products and services.
1947,India is projected to be among the top three energy consuming countries by 2030 . Even with a low per capita consumption it is ranked fourth in terms of carbon emissions . Though India has made progress in terms of deploying renewables as part of its climate commitments there has been a temporal and regional variation in terms of installed capacity . The paper aims to identify the drivers and challengers impacting the solar and wind power sectors in India through an expert survey . Thirty four sector experts representing ministries federal agencies renewable companies investor groups financial institutions and civil society responded to a questionnaire using a Likert Scale encompassing all possible factors which would have influenced these two sectors . Response depicted an even distribution of score with experts endorsing policies like feed in tariff auctions and tax depreciation and the requirement of a strong grid network to assimilate variable power . Commercial and infrastructure variables like cost of capital credit worthiness of utility land and road network were marked high . Experts envisaged heightened role of green power in future which may have to compete in open power markets sans any policy support . This analysis may be used for improving the effectiveness of Indian climate policies .,Feed in tariff tax credits and auctions came out as key policy measures. Utilities credit worthiness and cost of funds were key commercial factors. High share of variable power was identified as a technical challenge. Experts anticipate growing awareness on climate issues in India.
1948,Selective Laser Melting offers significant potential for a sustainable way of production . Raw material in form of metallic powder can directly be reused and the selective nature of the process offers new potential for resource economization . We introduce a mathematical model which allows conclusions about the influence of parameters like part volume and exposure parameters onto the resource consumption in an SLM process . For this purpose time and energy consumption are classified in process shares as a function of volume and process parameters . The introduced approach is validated by experimental methods under the consideration of part volume exposure parameters and batch size . While the approach shall be independent of the manufactured material the experiments are executed for the aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg . The measurements quantify the impact of the part volume and process parameters on the resource consumption and provide recommendations for improvements regarding an increased material efficiency . Additionally the established model can be used to analyze manufacturing costs for single parts or series productions . The results illustrate the importance of lightweight design methods for an efficient and sustainable production by powder bed fusion methods like SLM .,Design optimization combined with Additive Manufacturing provides resource efficiency. Machine and part independent resource model was developed for Selective Laser Melting. The resource analysis model enables a forecast of resource consumption time energy . Validation of resource analysis model by illustrative small batch production.
1949,Decarbonizing the energy intensive and natural resource based industries is possible but may substantially increase the cost of production . Whether such cost increases will reduce economic welfare depends on how the downstream industries respond to the higher cost for intermediate goods . In this paper we explore how downstream industries in the EU15 responded to upstream carbon technology shocks and prices shocks during the period 19982014 . Our results show that downstream industries do not respond to technology shocks directly but that they do respond to price shocks . A 5 percent upstream price increase is followed by a 4 percent increase in capital investments 3 percent increase in productivity and a 4 percent reduction in the carbon intensity among manufacturing industries . The utilities and construction industries respond primarily by increasing prices and reducing wages . Prices increase by approximately by 1 percent and real wages fall by approximately 2 percent following a five percent upstream price increase .,We test how a decarbonization of upstream industries affects downstream industries. Downstream industries are only affected if upstream industries increase prices. Manufacturing industries respond by investing in new capital and by innovating. Utility and construction industries respond by increasing prices and reducing wages.
1950,Investigation of the combined addition of attapulgite clay and benzoic acid in fattening pig diets seems to be reasonable both from a pig performance and environmental point of view . In this research an,A modified diet based on attapulgite and benzoic acid for fatteners was tested. The modified diet enhanced feed efficiency and growth of fatteners. The modified diet potentially improved the environmental performance. Feed intake and weight gain were decisive for the environmental performance.
1951,Limiting study to a narrow range of energy and water using activities is insufficient to provide a holistic understanding of household resource flows . Consideration of a wide range of social practices is needed . With the rise of low carbon developments featuring energy or water efficient technology and design around the world the way residents interact with the design and technology and community is vital to understanding if these households and developments will meet their intended design goals . The opportunity to study resident s pre and post occupancy resource consumption is a unique opportunity to examine how design technology and community influence household practices . This article studied 13 Australian household s practices of waste management food shopping item purchasing travel and laundry practices for two weeks before and after moving into a low carbon development while the home system of practice is in a stable phase . This provides an opportunity to comment on the state of interlocking of resident s home system from lightly interlocked to highly . Post occupancy the presence of solar panels influenced when some residents put the washing machine and tumble drier on however only when the resident was home . Many residents are conscious of putting these on during the day or use timers where they had not previously . Changes to resident s travel practices were not as broad as they anticipated before the move while recycling rates increased influenced by a supportive community and shopping practices became more localised through the use of smaller food retailers . Results show that resident s resource use is heavily influenced by their work and socialising routines which are not commonly focused on when attempting to change household resource use behaviours . A traditional focus on psychological approaches targeting values and attitudes fails to adequately address these factors whereby a social practice theory approach allows for their consideration in influencing resource use in the home .,Pre and post occupancy study was used to assess if changes to resource use. Changes to laundry recycling food and item purchasing practices were identified. Travel practices did not alter substantially despite resident intentions. Results show resource use is heavily influenced by work and socialising routines. The interlocking of practices in the home system are influenced by routines.
1952,The purpose of this article is to define how green innovation supports competitive advantage in a cluster of furniture companies located in Southern Brazil . The cluster encompasses 245 companies located in Southern Brazil . The research method is a survey which returned 98 valid responses from the companies sampled followed by a structural equation modeling by partial least squares executed by the SMART PLS software . A literature review produced a reference model for green innovation comprising 30 manifest variables . Factor analysis by principal components deleted two manifest variables and classified the others in three factors operation and process product and customer and eco efficiency . The model includes two endogenous latent constructs . The first is competitive enablers supported by corporate image customer satisfaction and market share . The second is competitive advantage supported by cost reduction and differentiation . The main results are green innovation focused on operation and process does not positively influence competitive enablers but influences competitive advantages green innovation focused on product and customers and eco efficiency positively influence the competitive enablers competitive enablers based only on product and customers and on eco efficiency positively influences the competitive advantage .,Green practices based on innovation are relevant for the environmental performance. Innovation plays a prominent role in the furniture industry. The study depicts three types of green innovation. Green innovation in product and eco efficiency support competitive enablers. Green innovation in operation and process reduces cost and promotes differentiation
1953,All economies rely today on metal use either in the construction or energy sectors or in more advanced technology sectors . Nevertheless not all countries have mining industries which implies that these countries need to import primary metal concentrates and semi finished goods containing metals to fulfill their final consumption . By importing these goods they also import their associated environmental externalities . Considering the French metropolitan territory where mining industries are on hold since the 1990s this study assesses the impacts on climate change of metals related activities induced by the French final demand as well as their share in the total French carbon footprint . The EXIOBASE v3.3 hybrid database is used to perform the assessment showing that the metal sector represents 13 of the total French carbon footprint . This contribution is mainly due to the iron and steel production activities that are linked to the construction and motor vehicles trailers and semi trailers goods consumed in France . The assessment also shows that France outsources 79 of the metal sector GHG emissions induced by its consumption . 55 of these emissions occur in the European Union and more than 17 specifically in China . Therefore despite metallic ores are pratically not anymore mined in France the embodied metal on the French final demand indirectly generates large greenhouse gases emissions abroad in particular CO,The metals sector is responsible for 13 of the total French carbon footprint. Iron and steel production is the main contributor to this share. France outsources 79 of the corresponding GHG emissions. These emissions are mainly outsourced in the European Union and in China.
1954,Environmental pollution resource scarcity and freshwater shortage are critical world challenges facing humanity . Process industry produces large amounts of brine a waste water with a high salinity level and often critical raw materials . This study applies the social life cycle assessment to quantify societal benefits and risks in developing brine treatment systems . S LCA is implemented for hotspot and site specific levels on four case studies of the Zero Brine project . Hotspot analysis focused on the major commodities . Social Hotspot Database was used as source for data and endpoint indicators . In addition site specific analysis regarded the social performance of the case studies companies interviews and questionnaires were performed with representatives of the four case studies . The collected data were converted to scores with subcategory assessment method and performance reference points . The results show that for all case studies Labor rights and decent work and Health and safety indicators result in the largest impacts due to imports of commodities from developing countries . Site specific results show that the overall social sustainability performance of the case study companies is at a good level . The only potential areas for improvement are the Occupational accidents and Contribution to the local community . The former are minimally higher for silica plant and higher for coal mine in relation to these sectors average accidents rates . Furthermore the coal mine company can contribute more to the local community and reduce conflicts concerning environmental impacts at the city level . Common identified hotspots among the case studies are China India and Congo . Reducing imports from these countries will significantly improve the societal performance of the brine systems .,Common social hotspots of supply chains of case studies are China India and Congo. Areas of concern were Occupational accidents rate and Organizational support for community initiatives. SLCA is a useful tool for companies to improve corporate social sustainability. The structure of Social Hotspot Database limits the hotspot analysis level results.
1955,The study examines the influence of investment in hazardous solid waste reduction on companies financial performance . The challenge is that investment in hazardous solid waste reduction is traditionally considered an unnecessary cost to companies with investors critical of such an undertaking because they perceive it to have insignificant or no returns . The study sampled 64 mining and manufacturing companies listed on the Social Responsibility Investment Index of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2017 . Using Panel Data analysis the results indicate that any investment in hazardous solid waste of the sampled companies is too insignificant to explain the changes in return on assets . The results however show that the current ratio is sufficiently significant to influence the return on assets . The results indicate that hazardous solid waste disposal through targeted investment decreases the risk of future liabilities for instance environmental litigation strikes and fines for environmental damage and could significantly affect the return on assets . The results suggest that hazardous solid waste reduction requires a substantial long term financial commitment for process change . An example of one such process change is the complete automation for improved efficiency . A short term approach is ultimately detrimental to tackling long term hazardous solid waste reduction issues .,Organisations consider investment in hazardous solid waste reduction as unnecessary. Targeted investment in hazardous solid waste reduction eliminates future liability. Achieving hazardous solid waste reduction needs long term financial commitment. Investment in hazardous solid waste reduction does not influence return on assets. A short term approach to reducing hazardous solid waste is short sighted.
1956,Turkey is one of the top five producers of olive oil in the globe . Olive pomace a by product of olive oil production has several environmental impacts on the ecosystem when untreated . In this study we compared five different scenarios for the treatment and utilization olive pomace in terms of their life cycle environmental impacts . These scenarios include i traditional ii two phase and iii three phase production of olive oil followed by producing biofuel pellets from the olive pomace iv producing fodder additives from olive pomace and v composting the olive pomace . The functional unit was chosen as olive pomace produced as a result of the production of 1kg of olive oil . The following impacts were calculated by using CCaLC software and CML2001 method with a gate to grave approach global warming potential acidification potential eutrophication potential ozone layer depletion photochemical smog formation potential and human toxicity potential . An overall impact calculation was also performed by normalizing the individual impacts and assigning equal weights to them . The first three scenarios were observed to have significantly lower impacts and in many cases even impact credits for the system mainly due to the fact that utilizing the biofuel pellet eliminates the consumption thus the production of natural gas which has especially high environmental impacts in case of Turkey . Traditional olive oil production was found to have a lower overall impact compared to two phase and three phase production . For most of the impacts operational processes and utilization emerged as the hotspots . This study is considered to be a valuable guide for the olive oil sector in Turkey in terms of reducing its environmental footprint while getting economic gain . This particular study is novel in the sense that to the best of our knowledge it is the first study conducted in Turkey in which a comprehensive life cycle assessment of utilizing olive pomace has been conducted . Future studies on this topic should focus on the consequential life cycle assessment of the nation wide implementation of the scenarios analyzed in this work .,Environmental life cycle assessment of olive pomace utilization was performed. Fuel pellet production fodder additive production and composting were studied. Traditional two phase and three phase olive oil production were compared. Fuel pellet production combined with traditional method is the best option. For most impacts production processes and use stage emerged as the hotspots.
1957,Integrated urban water management aims to promote water supply not only from conventional sources but also from wastewater reuse in part to address issues such as water scarcity . In line with the situation this work concerns greywater reuse in synthesizing and retrofitting water network at household and community levels . We consider various water using activities and suitable wastewater treatment technologies through a nonlinear optimization model based on a superstructure which incorporates multiple alternatives for greywater reuse regeneration and recycle . The model objective aims to minimize freshwater consumption and or wastewater generation in addition to the fixed capital cost of installing the pipes and the variable operating cost of water pumping . The optimization procedure is carried out subject to complying with constraints to reduce the contamination level to acceptable reuse limits or otherwise for disposal or discharge to the environment while meeting various real world design and operating specifications that include requirements for minimum water service and hygienic reasons . A real world case study is illustrated on a residential household with four occupants by combining engineering experience and physical insights to obtain a realistic model representation of the problem . To circumvent the solution challenge presented by the nonconvex formulation we apply a convexification strategy to handle the concave terms in the objective function . The proposed approach has demonstrated that significant reductions in freshwater use are possible .,The paper presents model based optimization of greywater reuse. The model includes novel problem based constraints for households and communities. A realistic case study is illustrated for a household with 4 occupants. Sensitivity analysis is performed to handle uncertainty in key model parameters. The results demonstrate that a significant reduction in freshwater use is possible.
1958,The life cycle environmental impacts of banana production and then its supply to the end user in Turkey were investigated . The low ground water temperatures in Turkey inhibits the yield of banana trees in Turkey and literature suggests that it is possible to double the yield of a single tree by increasing the irrigation water temperature to 27C . Hence three different scenarios were studied . In the first scenario the business as usual case was considered in the second scenario heating the irrigation water by using natural gas was studied and in the third scenario heating the irrigation water by using biogas produced on site via the anaerobic digestion of banana stem waste was analyzed . The functional unit was chosen as 2ton of bananas produced over the course of the lifetime of the biogas production system . CCaLC2 was used as software and CML2001 methodology was used . A cradle to grave approach was employed . The production processes were modelled based on real life data acquired from a real greenhouse in Turkey . Six impacts were calculated . Results show that four of the six impacts decreased when biogas was used suggesting that this practice has the potential to reduce the environmental footprint of banana productionThe results were found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the literature . It was concluded that in order to reduce the environmental footprint of banana production utilizing the stem waste instead of the conventional practice of burning is essential and special emphasis should be given to treating or utilizing the bioreactor digestate to further reduce the environmental footprint .,Environmental LCA of banana production in greenhouses in Turkey was realized. Business as usual and heating the irrigation water scenarios were compared. Anaerobic digestion of banana stem waste to obtain biomethane was studied. Using biomethane was found to be the scenario with the lowest carbon footprint. For most impacts production stage emerged as the main hotspot.
1959,Life cycle assessment was performed for comparing a single use bio based beverage cup with single use plastics and multiple use stainless steel alternative . The results reveal that the bio based cups produced from sugarcane in Thailand exhibit lower global warming and fossil depletion impacts than the petroleum based plastics but higher than multiple use stainless steel cups . Over prolonged use multiple use cups show better environmental performance than the others . Increasing the use of recycled materials by 25 percent for example helps to reduce environmental impacts in the range of 3556 percent indicating better performance in terms of global warming and fossil depletion impacts . However consumer behavior is an important factor because they may choose not to use the same cup for long using the multiple use stainless steel cup more than 140 times can outweigh the impact of all single use cups . Reuse and eventual recycling of materials supports the move towards the circular economy . In order to enable circular economy government policies and infrastructure must be in place to support the recycling of materials as well as the use of recycled materials to keep resources in the system as much as possible to close the loop of the takeaway beverage cups lifecycle .,Comparative life cycle assessment of plastic bioplastic and steel cups conducted. Reusable steel cups show the best environmental performance of prolonged use. Bioplastic cups show a better environmental performance than plastic cups. Use of recycled materials and recycling at end of life improve environmental profile.
1960,The success of deploying energy and water technologies in remote communities in developing countries can be improved by considering their synergistic relationships and their social economic and environmental implications . This paper first evaluates social implications of current energy and water supply in a prototypical remote community against five future scenarios for synergistic provision of electricity heat for cooking and water . This is followed by an integrated assessment of the social environmental and economic life cycle sustainability through multicriteria decision analysis . The Business as usual scenario shows high life cycle health impacts but low impacts from local air pollution . The contrary is true for the Independent and Advanced Independent scenarios which assume community self sufficiency in energy and water supply . Greater access to electricity and water in the Advanced and Advanced Independent scenarios increases the potential for human development and security of supply but there is an increase in the risk of accidents and decrease in social acceptability of the water supply . Similarly a transition towards clean cooking fuels away from traditional solid biomass reduces local air pollution but increases reliance on imported fuels . The Transition scenario is socially the most sustainable option while Independent and Advanced Independent are the best options environmentally . They also have the lowest total operating costs but have higher capital requirements than most other scenarios . Overall unless extreme preferences for either environmental or social aspects are adopted the Transition and Independent scenarios emerge as the most sustainable options . This suggests that current energy and water supply to remote communities can be transitioned sustainably to a self sufficient system that does not depend on imported resources . The scenarios developed in this work present a framework for an integrated design and evaluation of energy and water supply in remote communities with the aim of aiding stakeholders in defining sustainable transition pathways .,Synergistic off grid energy and water systems were designed for remote communities. Social environmental and economic sustainability was quantified for five scenarios. Current supply can be transitioned sustainably to a self sufficient synergen system. However some sustainability trade offs will be necessary. The outcomes can aid stakeholders in sustainable design of energy and water systems.
1961,Biofuels for use in on road transportation have been promoted in Thailand over the past decade to reduce dependence on imported fossil resources as well as possibly reducing greenhouse gas emissions . This has led to an increase in production of biodiesel which is produced from palm oil . However as palm oil is also used for food it is important to take this into consideration as well . Also oil palm cultivation is rather water intensive . Hence it is necessary to analyze the interlinkage between water food and energy to have a holistic understanding and prevent trade offs when addressing one issue in isolation . The water energy food nexus for oil palm cultivation in Thailand has been conducted following two widely used methods the Water Food Energy Nexus and Water Energy Food nexus assessment method . The results are demonstrated as a single score which is easier for suggesting a suitable area for oil palm plantation . The assessment indicates the southern region of Thailand is the most suitable for oil palm plantation . The recommendation is consistent with the suggestion of the government based on land and climate suitability . However this study considers more comprehensive aspects including various other environmental aspects . Oil palm cultivation mainly relates to the amount of freshwater consumption leading to the increment of fuel consumption for pumping water . On the other hand the effectiveness of fresh fruit bunch yield should be developed in the future . Besides the results recommend the central region for the expansion of oil palm cultivation in the future because of the availability of a good irrigation infrastructure .,Water energy food nexus has been conducted for oil palm cultivation in Thailand. Resources and environmental impacts are included in the nexus assessment. Southern region of Thailand found to be the most suitable for oil palm plantation. Central region is suggested for the expansion of oil palm cultivation in the future.
1962,The adoption of palm oil sustainability standards remains limited especially among plantation companies . This is a concern since plantation companies are pivotal for the palm oil industry not only because of their own production but because they form an important nucleus for smallholders . Using a panel technique this study investigates the drivers underlying the certification of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standard by plantation companies in Malaysia . We examine the period between 2007 and 2016 . Panel logistics analysis allows for changes in variables including company capacity and the time dependent price of crude palm oil . Despite the fact that these variables influence adoption our findings reveal that adoption is found to be elastic to changes only in proportion to the planted area . Plantation companies that have undertaken conservation efforts may present low hanging fruits . Given the currently limited response to adoption a partially targeted approach encompassing education and technical assistance financial assistance and regulation is recommended to create a more inclusive and enabling environment .,Advocacy of sustainability standards should also target plantation companies. Company capacity and price of crude palm oil influence RSPO adoption. Firms that have undertaken conservation efforts may present low hanging fruits. Partially targeted approach could create an inclusive enabling environment. Technical assistance financial aids and financial regulation are viable options.
1963,Textile consumption has significantly increased and textile encompasses about 5 of landfill . The EU circular economy package adopted in 2018 will for the first time require separate textile waste collection . However there is a need for a cooperative introduction of several policies in order to significantly turn down the textile disposal worldwide . The aim of this paper is to give an overview over policies and incentives within recycling and reuse showing to be effective for increased recycling of various materials . Detailed analysis of literature available about policies and incentives applied within the waste management for metals paper glass and plastic has shown that most of the regulations can directly be applied in textile industries and to affect the consumer behaviour . Tax relief and rewarding policies shown to be effective both for environment friendly production of materials and for improved consumer behaviour . Awareness of consumers can also be increased with implementation of policies including labelling for recycling . Challenges within textile recycling are also analysed and briefly discussed . Thus the present paper can be a helpful guideline for the development of policies within textile waste management .,Textile waste disposal encompasses 5 of global landfill. There is a need for implementation of recycling policies and legislations. Existing policies within recycling show to be effective. Existing recycling policies for other materials can be applied for textiles. Cooperative implementation of policies is necessary to diminish textile waste disposal.
1964,The present study assesses the electricity generation potential of methane from municipal solid waste through landfill gas to energy technology in 16 districts of Beijing municipality . Municipal solid waste generation potential and methane generation potential from landfills of each of the districts were estimated from 2019 to 2038 . Economic viability analysis of landfill gas to energy project based on Net Present Value Levelized Cost of Energy and Payback Period was conducted . Besides environmental impact analysis based on greenhouse gas emissions potential was evaluated . Key results indicate that the generation potential of municipal solid waste during the project period is 55 000 to 2 120 000 tons year . Chaoyang district has the highest municipal solid waste generation potential while lower municipal solid waste generation potential was observed in Mentougou district . It is also found that Chaoyang district had the highest electricity generation potential of 8 400 000 to 218 300 000 kWh year . Findings of the economic feasibility analysis show that landfill gas to energy project is viable in all the districts . However the project is highly viable in Chaoyang district with more positive net present value shorter payback period and lower levelized cost of energy . Greenhouse gas emission potential of landfill gas without energy recovery was the highest in all the districts . It was realized that landfill gas with energy recovery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72.3 in all the districts . This paper will provide scientific guidance for investment in landfill gas to energy projects in Beijing municipality and other municipalities of China .,Analysis of electricity generation potential of landfill methane in urban districts of Beijing is carried out. Economic viability analysis of landfill gas to energy project is performed. The highest electricity generation potential is recorded in Chaoyang district. Landfill gas to energy project is feasible in all the urban districts of Beijing. Landfill gas with energy recovery could reduce GHG emissions by 72.3 in all the districts.
1965,Green products are increasingly considered by companies owing to the significant attention of government regulations customers requests and competitors . Here we deal with Green Product Families by selecting green components modules and products which are produced based on the assembling to order approach to cover diverse customer needs . Designing a GPFs is important but not sufficient for sustainable optimization . In fact we need to simultaneously consider the supply chain of a GPF to control the pollution generated in the downstream supply chain . For a sustainable optimization approach this joint configuration is usually structured based on economic environmental and social criteria which are often conflicting . Maximizing the total profit maximizing the product greenness and minimizing the total supply chain cost with environmental considerations constitute our main objectives . We apply the Leader Follower Stackelberg game in order to present a joint configuration of the GPF and its green supply chain . Maximizing the total profit and maximizing product greenness are the two objectivesof the leader problem to attain the GPF . This is done by determining the optimal selection of components modules and product variants . The follower of the joint problem seeks to configure the supply chain by minimizing the GSC costs considering carbon emissions . This includes the optimal selection of suppliers manufacturers the assembly plant distribution centers and retailers . A bi level multi objective linear programming problem is used to model the Stackelberg game of the GPF GSC . A new particle swarm optimization algorithm named as bi level multi objective PSO is developed to solve the proposed bi level multi objective model . To show the validity of the proposed model and the efficiency of our algorithm a case study at a mobile phone company is worked through . Finally certain results with some managerial implications are obtained through a sensitivity analysis .,We use sustainable optimization to have green product family and supply chain. Leader follower Stackelberg game is used for joint configuration of green problems. Goals are maximizing profit and product greenness and minimizing supply chain cost. A bi level multi objective particle swarm optimization is used to solve the problem. Managerial implications are discussed in conducted experiments.
1966,Circular economy has in recent years been promoted as a promising alternative to unsustainable production systems . By comparing two different concepts of circularity circular economy and eco cycle which had political momentum in Sweden during the 2010s and the 1990s respectively the paper shows how issues of responsibility politics limits space and sustainability and even the shape of the circle itself have changed over the turn of the millennium . Based on a discourse analysis of two policy reports on the concepts a strong and a weak interpretation of circularity are identified . A weak circularity represented in circular economy is presumably without limits . Secondary resources shall only complement the growing extraction of primary resources while the responsibility for circularity is handed over from the state to individuals and entrepreneurs . A weak circularity excludes social responsibility and tends to reinforce unequal power relations . With a strong conceptualization of circularity on the other hand the producers and the state are responsible for creating a closed material loop limited in size and space based on the principle of fair distribution of resources . Drawing on the findings alternative directions of circulation are called for which are more globally oriented and socially inclusive .,Two different concepts of circularity in Swedish policy reports are analyzed. The analysis identifies a strong and a weak conceptualization of circularity. A strong circularity includes a closed loop and fairness within planetary limits. A weak circularity complements primary resource extraction from nature. Weak circularity is oriented towards the market and excludes social responsibility.
1967,The paper presents several multi criteria decision analysis methods for the purpose of assessing carbon dioxide utilization pathways to identify and select the most relevant processes to convert captured CO,Multi criteria decision making method is used to assess CO. utilization processes. The associated outcomes of various multi criteria methods are discussed. Low degree compensatory methods might be advised in environmental decision making. CO. derived options are ranked based on techno economic and environmental aspects. CO. derived methanol methane dimethyl carbonate are found to be of interest.
1968,The build orientation of parts which are produced by Additive Manufacturing processes has a considerable effect on material and energy consumptions . The choice of a specific build orientation from the range available is crucial because it has a direct impact on the economic and environmental aspects of part production .,A new method to orient parts in additive manufacturing is presented. The method is applied to different combinations of technologies and products. A reduction of environmental impact indicators is achieved. Solutions proposed by the method reduce the cost of the production.
1969,Online shopping makes consumption increasingly easy . It may lead to more sufficiency oriented goods and services being bought but also comes with the risk of overconsumption due to rebound and induction effects . This study examines whether perceived behavioral efficiency gains of online shopping are associated with higher consumption levels of new as well as sufficiency oriented goods or services .,Shopping online is perceived as easier than in store except alternative transport . Effects of online shopping on consumption levels depend on domain and motivation. Online shopping efficiency gains are linked to more digital devices and flights bought. Sufficiency oriented purchase is linked to online shopping efficiency gains.
1970,In previous research interrelationships between green innovation and supply chain collaboration are under explored . This study explores the effects of SCC on green innovation performance and considers supply chain collaborative drivers as a crucial part of green innovation strategy .

1972,In this study forecasting of Turkey s total renewable and hydro energy installed capacity and electricity generation from 2019 to 2030 was investigated . For this purpose fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model briefly as FANGBM and its reduced forms were used and compared . The prediction procedure was applied for the data sets from 2009 to 2018 and prediction performance of these models were measured with calculation of mean absolute percentage error value . The FANGBM gives the highest accurate results for all cases . According to the results of the FANGBM Turkey s total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation were estimated as 80.3 GW and 241.3 TWh in 2030 respectively . Additionally this model estimates that Turkey s hydropower installed capacity and electricity generation will be 30.7 GW and 57.3 TWh in 2030 respectively . All grey prediction models present that the share of hydropower in total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation will decrease from 2019 to 2030 . In 2030 the share of hydropower in total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation is obtained by FANGBM as 38.2 and 23.8 respectively . Finally it is suggested to the Turkish government to reduce the share of hydropower in total renewable electricity generation by increasing the share of other types of renewable sources due to the consideration of Turkey as an extremely water stress country in coming years .,Turkey s total renewable and hydro power are forecasted by 2030. Fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model gives the best prediction results. The share of hydro energy in total renewable power will decrease by 2030. In 2030 total renewable electricity generation are estimated in the range of 141.0150.8 TWh. In 2030 hydropower can satisfy 18.534.2 of total renewable electricity generation.
1973,A lot of recent studies have concluded that hydrogen could gradually become a much more significant component of the European energy mix for mobility and stationary fuel cell system applications . Yet the challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy still remains through the deployment of a viable hydrogen supply chain and an increasing fuel cell vehicle market share which allows to narrow the existing cost difference regarding the conventional fossil fuel vehicle market . In this paper the market penetration of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as substitutes for internal combustion engine vehicles has been evaluated from a social and a subsidy policy perspective from 2020 to 2050 . For this purpose the best compromise hydrogen supply chain network configuration after the sequential application of an optimization strategy and a multi criteria decision making tool has been assessed through a Social Cost Benefit Analysis to determine whether the hydrogen mobility deployment increases enough the social welfare . The scientific objective of this work is essentially based on the development of a methodological framework to quantify potential societal benefits of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles . The case study of the Occitania Region in France supports the analysis . The externality costs involve the abatement cost of CO,The market penetration of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles FCV is investigated. An optimization framework for hydrogen supply chains has been first developed. It has been coupled with a social cost benefit analysis SCBAs . The externality costs involve the abatement cost of CO. noise and local pollution as well as platinum depletion. A subsidy policy scenario has also been implemented. The case study of the Occitania Region in France supports the analysis. The payback time is 2043 socio economic scenario with externalities 2042 subsidy policy scenario with externalitied or 2046 baseline economic scenario .
1974,Life Cycle Inventories must meet the data quality requirements set out by the goal and scope of a Life Cycle Assessment . The literature on the timing of updating inventory data to meet the data quality requirements is almost non existent . In this study data were taken from publicly available reports congresses proceedings technical papers international databases and LCAs . Monte Carlo simulations were used to test for variance regression analysis was used to determine correlation between time and energy intensity . Different conventional automobile power train configurations were examined along with lightweight versions . Monte Carlo simulations were programmed for each automobile power train configuration . Least absolute residuals methods were used to confirm whether the variance seen in simulations was due to time or to other factors such as uncertainty or scattered data . The Monte Carlo simulations identified the variation by material and quantified their significance . Least absolute regression analysis identified and confirmed which materials have a clearly delineated temporal relationship rubber polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene lead copper steel recycled steel aluminum and recycled aluminum . Consequently recommendations are given for the time intervals for necessary data updates which depending on the material in question are between two and five years .,Monte carlo simulations tested for variance in energy intensity across time. 37 materials of manufacture found significant variance. Regression analysis identified linear relations of energy intensity versus time. Measured uncertainty highlights need for better data collection and updates in LCA.
1975,Existing buildings consume an inordinate amount of energy globally . The consumption negatively affects the environment and economy therefore it is necessary to improve energy performance in buildings by retrofitting the existing ones . Several energy retrofitting strategies are proposed in the energy efficiency programs and hence the selection of optimal and efficient solutions is a complex task . Several factors affect the implementation of energy retrofitting measures such as budget comfort requirement and reliable economic value . To this end the study was conducted to develop a decision support model for residential building owners based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming . The model was designed to select optimum energy retrofitting strategies . The objective function involves minimizing the total Life Cycle Cost of the energy retrofitting plan to achieve economic benefit while considering the budget thermal comfort and recommended illumination level as primary constraints . To test the validity of the model a case study of a residential building was conducted . The findings of the study suggest an energy retrofitting plan that decreases approximately 70 of energy consumption . A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effect of the change in the cost component on the Life Cycle Cost and energy saving .,The paper presents a Decision Support Model aimed to the public for optimum energy retrofitting strategies in residential buildings. The Decision Support Model minimizes the life cycle cost of Buildings under the constraints of thermal comfort illumination and budget. The Case study conducted to validate the utility of the Model shows a 34 and 70 Energy Savings for retrofitting budgets of US 8K and US 53K respectively. In the conducted Case Study The Life Cycle Cost was decreased from US 1 81M to US 1 7M when the investment budget increased from US 8K to US 21K. The calculated Payback Period and Savings to Investment ratio show that the Decision Support Model prioritize the most efficient retrofitting measures in the selection process
1976,Alternative fuels have been proposed to ensure compliance with the increasingly more stringent emission standards proposed by the International Maritime Organization . In addition the Icelandic government aims to introduce 10 renewable energy into the maritime sector before 2030 as well as eventually phasing out the use of heavy fuel oil . This paper conducts an extended cost competitiveness comparison concerning three fuels conventional methanol renewable methanol and HFO in the context of the Icelandic maritime sector . NG RN and HFO are compared and evaluated under three scenarios for fuel prices between 2018 and 2050 and three scenarios for the external costs of fuel consumption . The methodology for estimating external costs involved Impact Pathway Analysis for emissions of sulphur dioxide nitrous oxide particulate matter and non methane volatile organic compounds and increasing shadow prices for the costs of greenhouse gas emissions . The application of this methodology provides new information about the economic and environmental trade offs between the three fuel types . In our findings excluding external costs HFO emerges as the most cost competitive option . However when the externalities of fuel consumption are monetised and added to the fuel price NG is the most cost competitive option when high values are assumed for external costs . RN is the most expensive option according to all trajectories for fuel prices and external costs not becoming more cost competitive than HFO under any scenario until the 2040s . Therefore on cost criteria alone it is improbable that the fuel will contribute to Iceland s 10 renewable energy goal in the maritime sector before 2030 without subsidies or renewable marine fuel quotas .,Renewably produced methanol in Iceland is cost uncompetitive with Heavy Fuel Oil. Including externalities methanol from natural gas can be more cost competitive than HFO. Subsidies or renewable energy quotas necessary to make renewable methanol cost competitive.
1977,Sustainable supply chain innovation simultaneously creates value for social environmental and economic dimensions . It is a fact that innovation is very significant in achieving long term sustainability in the supply chain . Literature analysis reveals that an in depth investigation of SSCI implementation framework in developing nations is still limited . Hence this research work investigates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers to achieve sustainability in the supply chain using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process framework . The proposed framework is applied to an Indian manufacturing industry for the adoption of SSCIEs in its supply chain . This research identifies a total of thirty three SSCIEs through extensive literature review and consultation with the decision making panel . The identified enablers are then ranked based on their relative importance weight . The results reveal that collaboration and engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders is the most critical SSCIE to achieve sustainability in the supply chain followed by develop R D labs in relationships with marketing production universities and government institutes . Sensitivity analysis is also performed in this study to check the robustness in the ranking of SSCIEs . This research helps the managers policy makers of the Indian manufacturing industry to identify and understand the most significant SSCIEs to achieve sustainability in the supply chain . The ranking of SSCIEs assists the managers to systematically focus on the most significant SSCIE and work towards its successful adoption . This study implies that the successful adoption of SSCIEs enables simultaneous improvement in social environmental and economic dimensions for Indian manufacturing industries .,This study identifies and evaluates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers. We propose Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method to rank the enablers. Collaboration and engagement of various stakeholders is the most important enabler. Develop R D labs is the second most important enabler to achieve sustainability. Presents a structured approach to implement the enablers to achieve sustainability
1978,With quality function deployment as its basis the product design team is instrumental in promoting sustainability by incorporating relevant requirements in the early stages of the design process . The domain literature however contains significant gaps especially for food products . First the current literature fails to consider the requirements of all relevant stakeholders which are crucial to sustainability . Second while some offer various models of fuzzy QFD multiple attribute decision making they fail to comprehensively address the underlying interdependencies of decision parameters in the QFD . Furthermore the majority of the works on QFD MADM limit themselves to product planning while losing control over other subsequent phases of product development . Thus this work attempts to advance these gaps by proposing an integrated multiphase fuzzy QFD MADM framework that combines QFD analytic hierarchy process decision making trial and evaluation laboratory and analytic network process along with fuzzy set theory . A case study in a Philippine meat processing industry was implemented to demonstrate the proposed approach . The results of the case study show the crucial decision parameters for all phases which would serve as inputs to design teams . Unlike previous models the proposed framework preserves the transition of the priorities flow along with all four phases of product development . Thus the stakeholder requirements are integrated into all product development stages which is a strong indication that these requirements are addressed in each phase . Also the proposed framework ensures that the uncertainty and the underlying complexities of interdependencies among decision parameters of the four phases of product design and development are addressed . The proposed framework contributes to sustainable product design literature in a manner that is comprehensive and analytical .,We proposed an integrated multiphase framework for sustainable product design. Findings suggest that the transition of stakeholders priorities is preserved. Intertwined relationships of the previous and current phase design parameters are addressed. The proposed framework provides integrated priority decisions on each phase.
1979,Environmental pressures and climate change are leading companies and supply chains to consider new models for environmental protection . Circular Economy emerged as a sustainability paradigm able to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and waste generation . In the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment industry there is the need for systematically reviewing what the literature has investigated and found in the light of the Circular Economy perspective . Thus this paper aims to systematize the extensive scientific literature that exists about sustainability in the WEEE industry with a Circular Economy lens . Overall 115 articles were selected and analyzed according to four aspects objectives and methodology geography and approach actors and life cycle phases Circular Economy 4R scheme of Reduce Reuse Remanufacture and Recycle strategies . The analysis led to the identification of several research gaps in the literature which academia is called to fill . This state of the art review provides ten research directions that constitute the backbone of a research agenda about Circular Economy in the WEEE industry as well as an improved managerial understanding of this research field .,Circular Economy literature in Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment is reviewed. Objectives methods approaches strategies actors and life phases are analyzed. Research lacks a systemic approach in terms of ecosystem phases and strategies. A research agenda with ten research directions is framed
1980,Sustainable management of vehicles at their end of life stage offers a significant potential for resource recovery by closing the material loop and thus contributes to dealing with scarcity of resources . Although ELVs till date in countries like India are considered as waste and not as secondary resource material but if used judiciously may obviate the extraction of primary or virgin materials . Although policymakers have focused on ways to ensure higher resource efficiency in the automobile sector research on the role of the informal sector in recovering useful materials and parts from ELVs is limited . The present study examines the current situation of ELV processing at Mayapuri scrap market one of the largest informal markets for ELVs in Asia wherein mass balance approach is used to examine how hatchback cars are disposed . A conceptual framework depicting process flow and the interactions between the multiple stakeholders involved in this sector has been developed . Further approximately 7 of aluminium and 76 of iron by weight were recovered from the sampled hatchback cars . These results were used for estimating the potential to recycle and to recover useful materials from ELVs that are processed by the informal sector in India . Under the business as usual scenario the estimates show that the sector can recover about 0.34 million tonnes of aluminium and 4.03 million tonnes of iron by 2030 . These figures indicate the huge potential of this sector in a circular economy and highlight the need to make operations in this sector more formal and to include informal players in the value chain to address the scarcity of these resource .,Composition of cars at the end of their life was analysed for mass characterization. From primary data potential to recycle and recover materials from ELVs was estimated. Annual recovery of iron and aluminum was projected for 20162030. SWOT analysis was undertaken of an informal sector devoted to disposal of ELVs. Higher efficiency of manual dismantling of ELVs in the informal sector is highlighted.
1981,In 2015 China proposed to gradually reduce the cross subsidy of electricity price . In order to reduce cross subsidies and make electricity price reflect its actual cost it is necessary to estimate the scale of cross subsidies . Existing research has not yet seen the estimation of the scale of cross subsidy of electricity price for electricity grid provinces and residential and industrial users . Based on Ramsey s pricing theory and panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2017 this paper constructs an empirical model of power demand and price for industrial and residential users . The price elasticity of power demand for residential and industrial users is determined and the Ramsey price index of residential and industrial users are calculated . The scale of cross subsidies for electricity prices of residential and industrial users at the national level and in different power grids and provinces are estimated . The conclusions are as follows The elasticity of electricity demand of residential users is greater than that of industrial users . The sales price of residential and industrial users deviates from Ramsey s theoretical price . The cross subsidy provided by industrial users is far greater than that accepted by residential users . The residential users of Central China power grid receive the most cross subsidies and the industrial users of North China power grid provide the most subsidies . The unit power consumption of residential users in Northwest power grid receives the most subsidies while the industrial users in Central China power grid provide the most subsidies . The scale of cross subsidy of electric power in developed areas is larger than that in underdeveloped areas . Since 2015 the power system reform has little impact on the total power consumption of residential and industrial users .,Demand elasticity of residents is greater than that of industries. Electricity sales price deviates from ramsey s price. Industrial users provide more cross subsidies. Cross subsidy of electricity price in developed areas is larger. Power system reform has little impact on the total power consumption.
1982,The current study attempted to understand factors influencing pro environmental behaviors with Theory of Planned Behavior and Value Identity Personal norm model by proposing a new model . 16 hypotheses were tested using a total of 340 science teachers in several cities in central anatolia region in Turkey . Scales obtained from previous studies included eight psychological variables to measure antecedents of pro environmental behaviors . Structural equation modeling revealed that the proposed model has acceptable fit data and was determined for hypothesis testing . The results of the data analysis showed that the biospheric values have significant influence on TPB constructs . In addition attitude and perceived behavioral control had a direct influence on pro environmentalbehavioralintentions which encourage active engagement in pro environmental behaviors while subjective norm had no direct effect on pro environmentalbehavioralintentions . Lastly considering VIP constructs biospheric values and environmental self identity had a direct influence on personal norm which in turn affected pro environmental behaviors . Results of indirect relationship between constructs showed that attitude perceived behavioral control biospheric values and environmental self identity had indirect influence on pro environmentalbehaviors while the indirect relationship between subjective norm and behaviors was insignificant . Consequently 14 out of 16 hypotheses within the model that merged the TPB and the VIP were statistically supported in determining antecedents of pro environmental behaviors .,A robust proposed model was developed by merging TPB and VIP. The proposed model had strong predictive power to explain behaviors. Personal norm and intention had a significant direct effect on behaviors. Intention personal norm and environmental self identity had moderating roles on behaviors.
1983,The current public and private policies pursuing environmental sustainability targets mandate incisive management of packaging waste starting with those sectors that use virgin materials most . Food industries and food supply chains adopt huge volumes of plastic crates cardboard boxes and wooden boxes as transport packaging thereby representing a hotspot and an urgent call for scholars and practitioners to address . Whilst wooden and cardboard boxes are disposable solutions plastic containers can be employed as infinitely reusable and recyclable packages but require complex logistic systems to manage their life cycle . Optimization techniques can be exploited to aid the design and profitability of such complex packaging networks . This paper falls within the scarce literature on the design of pooling networks for reusable containers in the food industry . It proposes a strategic mixed integer linear programming model to design a closed loop system from the perspective of the packaging maker responsible for serving a food supply chain . The container s lifespan i.e . the number of cycles a package can be reused before recycling represents a crucial aspect to consider when modeling such networks . Incorporating lifespan constraints within the proposed closed loop network design model is the main novel contribution we provide to the literature . This model is applied to a real world instance of an Italian package pooler operating with a consortium of large scale retailers for the distribution of fruits vegetables bakery and meat products . A multi scenario what if analysis showcases how the optimal network evolves according to potential variations in the packaging demand as well as in the container lifespan demonstrating how to lead packaging makers to the profitability and the long term sustainability of the closed loop network .,This paper fosters infinitely reusable and recyclable containers in food industry. Provides strategic design support for closed loop packaging networks. Formulates an optimization model considering containers lifespan constraints. Illustrates a case study of a nation wide retail food supply chain. Identifies drivers of the reusable packaging pooler profitability and sustainability.
1984,Green antecedents and consequences have been widely explored recently . Despite the prominence of antecedents of green behavior literature provides little attention to how green thinking and altruism may translate into purchasing intentions for green electronics products . This research investigates two main questions first whether green thinking and green altruism directly predict green purchasing intention second how green intrinsic and extrinsic motivations can explain these relationships . Based on the cognitive affective behavior model and collection of 2021 samples of buyers from the electronics industry in China the results show that both green thinking and green altruism have a substantial impact on green purchasing intention . Notably green intrinsic motivation mediates these relationships while green extrinsic motivation moderates the effect of green thinking and green intrinsic motivation on green purchasing intention . Thus this research advocates that marketers and policymakers should focus on cognitive and affective elements of green stimuli as well as the intrinsic motivation of consumers for the success and adoption of green electronics products . While care should be taken when using green extrinsic motivation as it reduces the impact of green altruism and green intrinsic motivation on green purchasing intention . Theoretical and practical implications are discussed .,Green thinking and green altruism show positive impact on green purchase intention. Green thinking and green altruism have positive impact on green intrinsic motivation. Green intrinsic motivation plays a central role with partial and full mediation effects. Green extrinsic motivation reduces self driven motivations of green consumers.
1985,In this study selection of sustainable suppliers and order allocation problem is generalized by considering multi product multi supplier and multi period scenarios with quantity discounts lost sales and varying supplier availabilities . The study is designed in four phases . In the first phase suppliers are ranked by using integrated the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation considering social and environmental factors as well as economic factors . The output of the first phase is used in the second phase of the method . In the second phase a fuzzy multi objective optimization model is proposed to find quantities to be purchased from suppliers . In the third phase both the Augmented constraint method and LP metrics are used to obtain the Pareto front of the problem . Finally in the fourth phase a solution is selected by the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution from the non dominated solutions . The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown on real data from a firm selling medical devices .,Selection of sustainable suppliers and order allocation problem is addressed. More pareto solutions were found with the proposed method. An integrated method has been proposed for the problem. A fuzzy multi objective optimization model is proposed for the problem. Companies can develop procurement strategy using the proposed method.
