1,In recent years irritability has received increasing attention among mental health professionals given its transdiagnostic associations with diverse forms of psychopathology . In contrast to other emotional states and traits however literature addressing associations between irritability and related temperament and personality constructs is limited . In addition those who study irritability have diverse perspectives on its neurobiological substrates . In this comment we situate irritability in the literatures on child temperament and adult personality and describe a model in which irritability derives from low tonic dopamine levels and low phasic DA reactivity in subcortical neural structures implicated in appetitive responding . We note that different findings often emerge in neuroimaging studies when irritability is assessed in circumscribed diagnostic groups versus representative samples . We conclude with directions for future research and propose that more authors use hierarchical Bayesian modeling which captures functional dependencies between irritability and other dispositional traits that standard regression models are insensitive too . Treatment implications are also considered .
2,Treatments of neurodegenerative diseases are severely hampered by the presence of the blood brain barrier precluding efficient brain drug delivery . The development of drug nanocarriers aims at increasing the brain therapeutic index would represent a real progress in brain disease management . PEGylated polyester nanoparticles are intensively tested in clinical trials for improved drug delivery . Our working hypothesis was that some surface parameters and size of NPs could favor their penetration across the BBB and their neuronal uptake . Polymeric material PEG
3,The blood brain barrier prevents the permeability of drugs into the brain and as such limits the management of various brain diseases . To overcome this barrier drug encapsulating nanoparticles or vesicles drug conjugates and other types of drug delivery systems have been developed . However the brain targeting ability of nanoparticles or vesicles is still insufficient . Recently among the various brain targeting ligands previously studied for facilitating transcellular BBB transport several sugar appended nanocarriers for brain delivery were identified . Meanwhile cyclodextrins have been used as nanocarriers for drug delivery since they can encapsulate hydrophobic compounds with high biocompatibility . Therefore in this study we created various sugar appended cyclodextrins to discover novel brain targeting ligands . As a result of the six sugar appended CyDs lactose appended CyD showed greater cellular uptake in hCMEC D3 cells human brain microvascular endothelial cells than other sugar appended CyDs did . In addition the permeability of Lac CyD within the
4,Utilization of unique acidic environment in various disease sites has been quite advantageous in targeted drug delivery . Among the widely explored pH sensitive moieties such as hydrazone orthoester imine vinylether
5,Drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to several anatomical and physiological barriers . Thus there is a need for prolonged action and targeted drug delivery to treat retinal diseases . Intravitreal injections avoid anterior eye barriers but the vitreoretinal interface and inner limiting membrane may prevent access of drug delivery systems to the retina . Existing data on retinal permeation of intravitreal nanoparticles are sparse and probably misleading due to the inter species differences of retinal structures in rodents and humans . To bridge this gap retinal permeation of light activated liposomes was studied in an ex vivo bovine explant system that simulates the structure of vitreoretinal interface and intact ILM . Our findings indicate that the particle size plays a significant role in determining the retinal penetration as the liposomes of 100nm sized failed to overcome the ILM and could not permeate into the retina . In addition our results demonstrate the impact of surface charge and PEG coating on retinal penetration . Small anionic liposomes with PEG coating showed the most extensive distribution and cellular localization in the retina . In summary this study extends understanding of ocular barriers and provides valuable information to augment design of retinal drug delivery systems .
6,Owing to their tremendous potential the inference of nano scaled materials has revolutionized many fields including the medicine and health particularly for development of various types of targeted drug delivery devices for early prognosis and successful treatment of various diseases including the brain disorders . Owing to their unique characteristic features a variety of nanomaterials have shown tremendous success in achieving the prognostic and therapeutic goals for early prognosis and treatment of various brain maladies such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease brain lymphomas and other ailments . However serious attention is needful due to innumerable after effects of the nanomaterials . Despite their immense contribution in optimizing the prognostic and therapeutic modalities biological interaction of nanomaterials with various body tissues may produce severe nanotoxicity of different organs including the heart liver kidney lungs immune system gastro intestinal system skin as well as nervous system . However in this review we have primarily focused on nanomaterials induced neurotoxicity of the brain . Following their translocation into different regions of the brain nanomaterials may induce neurotoxicity through multiple mechanisms including the oxidative stress DNA damage lysosomal dysfunction inflammatory cascade apoptosis genotoxicity and ultimately necrosis of neuronal cells . Our findings indicated that rigorous toxicological evaluations must be carried out prior to clinical translation of nanomaterials based formulations to avoid serious neurotoxic complications which may further lead to develop various neuro degenerative disorders .
7,As one of the deadliest diseases cancer frequently resists existing therapeutics because they do not target all cells within a progressing tumor for example both tumor stem and proliferating cells . This frequently results in enrichment of invasive and metastatic drug resistant tumor cells subpopulations cancer recurrence and eventually patient mortality . Thus there is an urgent need to identify specific markers by which the targeted imaging and or therapeutic guided missile like agents can specifically detect and or eradicate all cancer cells within a heterogeneous tumor while leaving the normal cells intact . As a member of heat shock protein 70 superfamily glucose regulated protein 78 has been documented as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum which mainly responds to ER stresses in normal cells . There is over expression of GRP78 on the surface of cancer cells and angiogenic endothelial cells which makes it a promising target for different types of peptides and antibodies that can be employed for targeted cancer therapy or imaging . In this review we discuss the biological processes functional importance and translocation mechanisms of cell surface GRP78 in tumor cells . As a cancer biomarker we also review the potential applications of csGRP78 targeted therapy and imaging and finally we suggest a brief roadmap ahead of csGRP78 targeting for targeted theranostic implications .
8,Adeno associated virus is a promising vector for gene therapy but its broad tropism can be detrimental if the transgene being delivered is harmful when expressed ubiquitously in the body i.e . in non target tissues . Delivering the transgene of interest to target cells at levels high enough to be therapeutically effective while maintaining safety by minimizing delivery to off target cells is a prevalent challenge in the field of gene therapy . We have developed a protease activatable vector platform based on AAV9 that can be injected systemically to deliver therapeutic transgenes site specifically to diseased cells by responding to extracellular proteases present at the disease site . The provector platform consists of a peptide insertion into the virus capsid which disrupts the virus ability to bind to cell surface receptors . This peptide contains a blocking motif flanked on either side by cleavage sequences that are recognized by certain proteases . Exposure to proteases cleaves the peptides off the capsid activating or switching ON the provector . In response to the activation the provectors regain their ability to bind and transduce cells . Here we have designed a provector that is activated by cysteine aspartic proteases which have roles in inflammation and apoptosis and thus are elevated at sites of diseases such as heart failure neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke . This provector demonstrates a 200 fold reduction in transduction ability in the OFF state compared to AAV9 reducing the virus ability to transduce off target healthy tissue . Following exposure to and proteolysis by caspase 3 the provector shows a 95 fold increase in transduction compared to the OFF state . The switchable transduction behavior was found to be a direct result of the peptide insertion ablating the ability of the virus to bind to cells . In vivo studies were conducted to characterize the biodistribution blood circulation time neutralizing antibody formation and targeted delivery ability of the caspase activatable provector in a model of heart failure .
9,The use of intraperitoneal administration of nanoparticles has been reported to facilitate higher concentrations of nanoparticles in metastatic peritoneal tumors . While this strategy is appealing for limiting systemic exposure of nanocarrier delivered toxic cargoes and increasing nanoparticle concentrations in avascular peritoneal tumors little is known about the mechanism of nanoparticle accumulation on tumor tissues and currently no nanoparticle based product has been approved for intraperitoneal delivery . Here we investigated the nanoparticle specific characteristics that led to increased peritoneal tumor accumulation using MCM 41 type mesoporous silica nanoparticles as our model system . We also investigated the components of the peritoneal tumor stroma that facilitated nanoparticle tumor interaction . The tumor extracellular matrix is the main factor driving these interactions specifically the interaction of nanoparticles with collagen . Upon disruption of the collagen matrix nanoparticle accumulation was reduced by 50 . It is also notable that the incorporation of targeting ligands did not increase overall tumor accumulation
10,Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative disease involving numerous joint tissues and cells with a growing rate in prevalence that ultimately results in a negative social impact . Early diagnosis OA progression monitoring and effective treatment are of significant importance in halting OA process . However traditional imaging techniques lack sensitivity and specificity which lead to a delay in timely clinical intervention . Additionally current treatments only slow the progression of OA but have not meet the largely medical need for disease modifying therapy . In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve clinical efficacy nanotheranostics has been proposed on OA remedy which has confirmed success in animal models . In this review different imaging targets based nanoprobe for early and timely OA diagnosis is first discussed . Second therapeutic strategies delivered by nanosystem are summarized as much as possible . Their advantages and the potential for clinical translation are detailed discussed . Third nanomedicine simultaneously combined with the imaging for OA treatment is introduced . Nanotheranostics dynamically tracked the OA treatment outcomes to timely and individually adjust therapy . Finally future prospects and challenges of nanotechnology based OA diagnosis imaging and treatment are concluded and predicted . It is believed that nanoprobe and nanomedicine will become prospective in OA therapeutic revolution .
11,We review the challenges of next generation therapeutics for both systemic and localised delivery to brain tumours and discuss how recent engineering advances may be used to enhance brain penetration of systemic delivery therapies .
12,Most attempts to define life have concentrated on individual theories mentioning others hardly at all but here we compare all of the major current theories . We begin by asking how we know that an entity is alive and continue by describing the contributions of La Mettrie Burke Leduc Herrera Bahadur DArcy Thompson and especially Schrdinger whose book
13,Excitability is an intrinsic feature of a living matter . A commonly accepted feature of an excitable medium is that a local excitation leads to a propagation of circular or spiral excitation wave fronts . This is indeed the case in fully excitable medium . However with a decrease of an excitability localised wave fragments emerge and propagate ballistically . Using FitzhHughNagumo model we numerically study how excitation wave fronts behave in a geometrically constrained medium and how the wave fronts explore a random planar graph . We uncover how excitability controls propagation of excitation in angled branches influences arrest of excitation entering a sudden expansion and determines patterns of traversing of a random planar graph by an excitation waves .
14,The SBML standard is used in a number of online repositories for storing systems biology models yet there is currently no Web capable JavaScript library that can read and write the SBML format . This is a severe limitation since the Web has become a universal means of software distribution and the graphical capabilities of modern web browsers offer a powerful means for building rich interactive applications . Also there is a growing developer population specialized in web technologies that is poised to take advantage of the universality of the web to build the next generation of tools in systems biology and other fields . However current solutions require
15,This is a review of recent work on how the physics of evolution accounts for the origin changes and future of social systems . Evolution means the changes that happen with discernible direction in time . Changes are everywhere because physical features of freedom to change are in every moving and flowing system . With freedom comes evolution and with evolution come all these visible things movement change configurations diversity multiple scales and the universality of social organization phenomena such as human settlements hierarchy economics economies of scale and diminishing returns .
16,The cytoskeleton of cilia and flagella is so called axoneme a stable cylindrical architecture of nine microtubule doublets . Axoneme performs periodic bending motion by utilizing specific dynein motor family powered by ATP hydrolysis . It is still unclear how this highly organized ciliary beat is being initiated and strongly coordinated by the combined action of hundreds dynein motors . Based on the experimental evidences we here elaborate a plausible scenario in which actually calcium ions play the roles of catalytic activators and coordinators of dynein attachments doing it in superposition with already known mechanical control tools of ciliary beat . Polyelectrolyte properties of microtubules incorporated in axoneme doublets enable the formation and propagation of soliton like ionic clouds of Ca
17,Bacterial essence of mitochondria and chloroplasts was initially proclaimed in general outline . Later the remarkable insight gave way to an elaborate hypothesis . Finally it took shape of a theory confirmed by molecular biology data . In particular the
18,The endosymbiosis theory most widely accepted variant surmises the engulfment of a bacterial cell by an archaeal cell . For decades this scenario was reputed to be an unconfirmed hypothesis and only recently it has obtained an indirect proof in Asgard archaea environmental DNA encoding eukaryotic signaturesactin cytoskeleton small GTPases and ESCRT complex . In view of growing interest to this aspect of the endosymbiosis theory it seemed timely to revisit the basic terms eukaryotic cell eukaryotes nucleated organisms . The article highlights the ambiguous applications of these terms and seeks for their consistency with regard to phylogeny and taxonomy . Additionally new name Caryosignifera is proposed for the phylum represented by the underexplored Asgard archaea manifested by above mentioned environmental DNA cultured species of engulfing Asgard archaea eukaryotic host cells in nucleated organisms .
19,Fuzzy based self organizing aggregation method was suggested in the present study for swarm robots . In the suggested method Swarm robots evaluate their limited sensor input via rules of fuzzy logic and display aggregation behavior with the suggested aggregation method . In the meantime swarm robots also have the ability to escape the obstacles in a bounded arena with this method . Swarm robots perceive the neighboring robots with this method make individual decisions and display aggregation behaviors . Different from the traditional self organizing aggregation methods the suggested approach utilizes fuzzy logic controllers to evaluate limited sensor data . Systematic experiments were applied on different number of swarm robots with different detection areas in arenas of different sizes . Moreover noise was applied on the sensor inputs for examining the performance of the fuzzy logic based self organizing aggregation method . The scalability and flexibility of the self organizing aggregation behaviors of swarm robots were evaluated by way of systematic experiments . The swarm robots displayed aggregation behavior during the systematic experiments applied despite the changes in the number of robots and detection distances .
20,Paces of change are faster in cultural evolution than in biological evolution due to different levels of stability in information storage . This study develops mathematical models to investigate the consequences of differential mutation rates on the ability of groups of information units to survive over many generations . We examined the ability of groups composed of connected units to live on despite the occurrence of deleterious mutations that occur at probabilities ranging from 10
21,What is life and Erwin Schrdinger s answer negative entropy inspired researchers in the 20th century to unite physics chemistry and physiology into a new synthesis that many believe to be an important foundation for life science today . Decades after Schrdinger life scientists are still fascinated by the riddle that entropy can only accumulate in physical systems which often leads to biological deterioration and death but life finds ways to persist and prevail . So to say life negates entropy . Can this fascination and research concept be broadened even further to human culture Short after Schrdinger s publication Claude Shannon coined the term information entropy . Information entropy accumulates when noise interferes during communication . Eventually all useful information is lost . Yet from this observation something surprising can be inferred . Not only biological life but also cultural life has the ability to persist and prevail in spite of the accumulation of entropy . Does this insight mean that cultural life also negates entropy in Schrdinger s sense These questions guided me over several years of research during which I developed and tested a new theory of culture based on variation selection processes and homeostatic regulation . My contribution is to discover that these two processes not only make statements about biological life . They also explain some of the most important phenomena of culture returning fashions polarization diversification cycles of growth and reform and the formation of common ethos across entire bodies of knowledge . With access to big data and supercomputing I tested my theory against hundreds of thousands of news magazine articles books and TV transcripts as well as textual content collected from the social media . Historical institutional and geographical information was extracted from these data using a new method and new interactive tools were created to interpret the results . What should not be missed when reading this article is that the theory proposed here reveals a striking equivalence between nature and culture . The article states this equivalence in mathematical terms and contextualizes it in the history of science . The mathematical breakthrough is relevant because it aligns the humanities to science while also allowing for live evaluation of what I call cultural diversification cycles .
22,Centrosome composed of two centrioles arranged in an orthogonal configuration is an indispensable cellular organelle for mitosis . 130 years after its discovery the structural functional relationship of centrosome is still obscure . Encouraged by the telltale signs of the Mouse and Magnet experiment Paul Schafer pioneered in the research on electromagnetism of centriole with electron microscopy in the late 1960s . Followed by the decades long slow progression of the field with sporadic reports indicating the electromagnetisms of mitosis . Piecing together the evidences we generated a mechanistic model for centrosome function during mitosis in which centrosome functions as an electronic generator . In particular the spinal rotations of centrioles transform the cellular chemical energy into cellular electromagnetic energy . The model is strongly supported by multiple experimental evidences . It offers an elegant explanation for the self organized orthogonal configuration of the two centrioles in a centrosome that is through the dynamic electromagnetic interactions of both centrioles of the centrosome .
23,Promoter recognition is an important part of functional genomic annotation but a difficult problem . Many studies have been carried out to address this issue . However they still can not meet application needs . Most of the methods exhibit specificity and the objects analyzed are relatively simple especially for prokaryotes . Hence more research on prokaryotic promoters is lacking .
24,Intercellular calcium signaling allows cells to communicate with each other and to interact with adjacent cells . Gap junction is the most common and important way for cellular communication . Recently mathematical models have been widely used to gain a precise and quantitative understanding of the dynamics of intracellular calcium ions Ca
25,Here I use the rationale assuming that if of a certain trait that exerts its function in some aspect of the genetic code or more generally in protein synthesis it is possible to identify the evolutionary stage of its origin then it would imply that this evolutionary moment would be characterized by a high translational noise because this trait would originate for the first time during that evolutionary stage . That is to say if this trait had a non marginal role in the realization of the genetic code or in protein synthesis then the origin of this trait would imply that more generally it was the genetic code itself that was still originating . But if the genetic code were still originating at that precise evolutionary stage then this would imply that there was a high translational noise which in turn would imply that it was in the presence of a protocell i.e . a progenote that was by definition characterized by high translational noise . I apply this rationale to the mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of an isoleucine tRNA that leads to the reading of AUA and AUG codons in archaea bacteria and eukaryotes . The phylogenetic distribution of this mechanism in these phyletic lineages indicates that this mechanism originated only after the evolutionary stage of the last universal common ancestor namely during the formation of cellular domains i.e . at the stage of ancestors of these main phyletic lineages . Furthermore given that this mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of the isoleucine tRNA would result to emerge at a stage of the origin of the genetic code despite in its terminal phases then all this would imply that the ancestors of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes were progenotes . If so all the more so the LUCA would also be a progenote since it preceded these ancestors temporally . A consequence of all this reasoning might be that since these three ancestors were of the progenotes that were different from each other if at least one of them had evolved into at least two real and different cells basically different from each other then the number of cellular domains would not be three but it would be greater than three .
26,A metapopulation model is investigated to explore how the spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey interactions . A RosenzweigMacArthur predatorprey model with dispersal of both the prey and predator is formulated . We propose such a system as a well mixed spatial model . Here partially mixed spatial models are defined in which the dispersal of only one of the communities is considered . In our study the spatial heterogeneity is induced by dissimilar dispersal rates between the patches . A large difference between the predator dispersal rates may stabilize the unstable positive equilibrium of the model . The existence of two ecological phenomena are found under independent harvesting strategy stability switching and hydra effect . When prey or predator is harvested in a heterogenious environment a positive stable steady state becomes unstable with increasing the harvesting effort and a further increase in the effort leads to a stable equilibrium . Thus a stability switching happens . Furthermore the predator biomass in both the patches increases when the patch with a higher predator density is harvested resulting a hydra effect . These two phenomena do not occur in the non spatial RM model . Hence spatial heterogeneity induces stability switching and hydra effect .
27,The Predictive Processing Theory and its foundational Free Energy Principle provide a unifying theoretical groundwork that subsumes theories of perception cognition and action . Recently Colin Klein contends that PP FEP can not explain adaptive action with the same force that they deal with perceptions . In his answer to the objection Clark points out that FEP explains action desire and motivation on the basis of minimisation of energy . I argue that this answer begs the question of the unifying framework of FEP . I assume that FEP PP alone can not provide an ultimately compelling explanation of action . However I argue that when paired with a high level theory of psychology such as Theriault et al.s theory of social conformation in terms of the sense of should the coupled theories provide an inclusive symmetrical explanation of action . The symmetry of explanations is not a gap but a feature on this specific occasion .
28,Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition is a natural and reversible process involved in embryogenesis wound healing and thought to participate in the process of metastasis . Multiple signals from the microenvironment have been reported to drive EMT . However the tight control of this process on physiological scenarios and how it is disrupted during cancer progression is not fully understood . Here we analysed a regulatory network of EMT accounting for 10 key microenvironment signals focusing on the impact of two cell contact signals on the reversibility of EMT and the stability of resulting phenotypes . The analysis showed that the microenvironment is not enough for stabilizing Hybrid and Amoeboid like phenotypes requiring intracellular de regulations as reported during cancer progression . Our simulations demonstrated that RPTP activation by cell contacts have the potential to inhibit the process of EMT and trigger its reversibility under tissue growth and chronic inflammation scenarios . Simulations also showed that hypoxia inhibits the capacity of RPTPs to control EMT . Our analysis further provided a theoretical explanation for the observed correlation between hypoxia and metastasis under chronic inflammation and predicted that de regulations in FAT4 signalling may promote Hybrid stabilization . Taken together we propose a natural control mechanism of EMT that supports the idea that EMT is tightly regulated by the microenvironment .
29,Waddingtons epigenetic landscape is a classic metaphor for describing the cellular dynamics during the development modulated by gene regulation . Quantifying Waddingtons epigenetic landscape by mathematical modeling would be useful for understanding the mechanisms of cell fate determination . A few computational methods have been proposed for quantitative modeling of landscape however to model and visualize the landscape of a high dimensional gene regulatory system with realistic details is still challenging . Here we propose a Monte Carlo method for modeling the Waddingtons epigenetic landscape of a gene regulatory network . The method estimates the probability distribution of cellular states by collecting a large number of time course simulations with random initial conditions . By projecting all the trajectories into a 2 dimensional plane of dimensions
30,Single neurons in an autaptic culture exhibit various types of firing pattern with different firing durations and rhythms . However a neuron with autapses has often been modeled as an oscillator providing a monotonic firing pattern with a constant periodicity because of the lack of a mathematical model . In the work described in this study we use computational simulation and whole cell patch clamp recording to elucidate and model the mechanism by which such neurons generate various firing pattens . In the computational simulation three types of spontaneous firing pattern i.e . short long lasting and periodic burst firing patterns are realized by changing the combination ratio of
31,This study investigates the effect of international migration experience on entrepreneurship in sending areas . To identify prosperous businesses that create jobs and encourage economic development this study isolates businesses other than street vending enterprises with non family employees . Retrospective life history data from the Mexican Migration Project was used to estimate the annual probability of becoming an entrepreneur across 170 Mexican communities between 1975 and 2017 . This study found that any prior migration experience increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry relative to non migrants accumulated months of migration experience are positively associated with the probability of entrepreneurial entry undocumented status is associated with a lower probability of entrepreneurial entry . The positive effect of accumulated migration experience on entrepreneurship suggests that international migrants can accumulate human and financial resources that are essential to early stage entrepreneurship . Thus entrepreneurship represents an important pathway through which international migration can encourage economic development in less developed regions . At the same time the results suggest that that immigration policies in receiving countries can undercut migrants capacities to mobilize resources and contribute to economic development upon return . These findings suggest that target migration creates a winwin by addressing labor shortages in receiving countries while transferring resources to sending areas that enable economic mobility and development .
32,We adopt a complementary methods approach to investigate whether and how heterogeneity in individual returns to a public good affects public good provision . We engage smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka in a one shot framed lab in the field experiment within which the farmers rates of return to the public good are exogenously varied and a survey including a question about the farmers willingness to contribute time to the construction of a specific hypothetical public good the return from which for a given farmer would depend on his or her circumstances in everyday life . In the former we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions . In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect either way at the group level . We conclude that heterogeneity in returns does not explain why collective action remains a challenge in farming communities in developing countries . From a methodological point of view we find that using complementary methods provides a more balanced account of communities potential engagement in public good provision
33,Who participates in modern agricultural value chains and what determinants inform HVM participation remains a question of interest to researchers and policymakers . This issue is noteworthy because of the positive welfare effects of HVM participation . In this article we review the empirical literature on determinants influencing HVM participation . We use quantitative descriptive statistics and
34,On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the CGIAR this paper revisits the genesis of the international center model for agricultural research . This model became fashionable in the 1960s and was arguably the major institutional innovation of the 20th century for foreign assistance to agriculture . While the founding of the first IARCs is universally attributed to the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations we argue that based on new evidence the creation of the IARCs was a logical conclusion of a process involving many actors that began immediately after World War I . First we review FAO efforts to build regional and global research networks for the major cereals in the immediate post WWII period . These networks linked closely to USDA and its legacy of scientific collaboration across US states that together with the Foundations strongly influenced the design of the first two international centers for the major cereals . In Latin America the various efforts by the US National Academy of Sciences the US government and the countries of the region resulted in the creation of three centers for tropical agriculture with a broader research focus on farming systems and natural resources . Finally we show how the establishment of four IARCs in Africa in different ways drew on a colonial legacy that had moved toward centralization of research across colonial territories since before WWII . All of these efforts over many decades involved a good deal of experimentation in organization funding and governance to arrive at the standard IARC model that emerged . By the late 1960s the genesis of another six IARCs was already in place stimulating the creation of the CGIAR to fund and coordinate the IARCs . The review concludes with a brief reflection on the successes and challenges of the IARC model over 50years and its relevance today .
35,Community centered development has gained renewed interest as a means of providing aid to fragile states . This paper aims to explore how CCD aid projects in a fragile state are shaped by distinctive ideologies . Using document reviews stakeholder interviews and spatial analysis this paper analyzes two aid projects in Myanmar the Korean government supported
36,Developing countries are highly vulnerable to the COVID 19 pandemic in part due to the lack of international support for ensuring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals . Yet the mounting financial burden faced by all countries means that additional support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future . It is critical that developing countries find innovative policy mechanisms to achieve sustainability and development aims in a cost effective manner . This requires identifying affordable policies that can yield immediate progress towards several SDGs together and aligns economic incentives for longer term sustainable development . We identify three policies that meet these criteria a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments and dissemination of renewable energy in rural areas reallocating irrigation subsidies to improve water supply sanitation and wastewater infrastructure and a tropical carbon tax which is a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions . Such innovative and cost effective policy mechanisms do not require substantial external support and they foster greater progress towards achieving the SDGs in poorer economies .
37,This article discusses the prospects for forging new social contracts in highly fragile and conflict affected countries . Building on analytical insights from the political settlements and state fragility literature conceptualising peacebuilding processes as efforts to forge social contracts enables us to address the roles of governments social groups citizens and external stakeholders . We discuss the potential for peacebuilding processes to realise social contracts by assessing societal perceptions of the core public good that citizens expect the state to provide namely protection . We address two cases where stateness was destroyed by foreign intervention and civil war Iraq and Libya . We discuss the troubled recent trajectories of efforts to build peace in Iraq and Libya along the substantive spatial and temporal dimensions of the social contract . Drawing on interviews survey results and estimates of civilian casualties we take a bottom up perspective of their societies experiences and expectations regarding protection . We conclude that in both countries the provision of protection by the state and others runs counter to the expectations of significant parts of the population . At the national level major social groups have been unable to overcome mutual distrust while continued threats to physical security reduce the prospects that any social contract able to deliver other public goods can ever emerge . Existing political settlements in both countries have rewarded the politicization of ethno sectarian identity and have benefited economic war lordism . We conclude that as social contracts at the national level are unlikely to emerge the consequences of de facto break ups of both countries must be acknowledged if social contracts at sub national levels are to have any chance of delivering peace .
38,The COVID 19 pandemic has hit at a time when microfinance is at its historical peak with an estimated 139 million microfinance customers globally . Cambodias microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing and like others in the Global South has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity and even disaster relief . In this Viewpoint however we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern not comfort . We firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with COVID 19 credit taking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts . Second we contend that a growing reliance on MFIs will leave households undernourished and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses . Third we argue that the interplay between over indebtedness pre existing malnutrition challenges and the global public health crisis of COVID 19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development . Coordination between the Cambodian government microfinance lenders international investors and development partners is vital to offer debt relief . Furthermore to reverse the reliance of so many households on the microfinance industry for survival inclusive socio economic policies and public welfare services must be prioritised .
39,Indias progressive Right to Information Act is a global model . The RTIA was adopted a decade and a half ago to serve as a check on corruption and to advance democracy citizen equity and public accountability . Little primary research has been conducted on the implementation of the RTIA . This research employs a socio political and technocratic framework to study influences on RTIA implementation over time from the citizen requester demand side and the governmental supply side from an institutional development process perspective . Our constructivist approach utilizes in depth semi structured interviews from frequent information requesters and information commissioners
40,Agricultural labor productivity remains low in China . The unique land tenure system and fast growing land rental market in China provides a new perspective in understanding the ALP problem . This study investigates the impact of participation in the land rental market on operator households agricultural labor productivity in rural China . Using national representative farm level data propensity matching score and mediation analysis we find that farm households ALP has improved about 43 after renting in farmland . The mediation analysis reveals that farm size in cultivation family farm labor input and capital services input are mediating variables through which land rental affects ALP . The indirect effect of land rental on labor productivity is mainly through the single variable mediation path namely farm size and family farm labor input . Additionally the two variable mediation path is through farm size and capital services input farm size and family farm labor input .
41,This contribution analyzes the social impacts of participatory approaches introduced by international development agencies and the Chinese central government on dam resettlement in China . By analyzing resettlement villages in Yunnan Province we first explore the complex ways in which local governments implemented one specific participatory approach namely the right for dam resettlers to choose between self or government organized resettlement . We examine the reactions and specific responses of dam migrants to this participatory approach and probe how this right to choose testifies to political rationalities that convey a narrow understanding of participation and shift responsibility for resettlement outcomes from the state to households . Secondly we highlight the ways in which migrant households navigate the new participatory approach and its impacts on post resettlement livelihoods . We notably highlight how the right to choose reshuffled pre resettlement social and power relations between local authorities and self and government resettlers . Our study demonstrates first that in Chinas socialist governmentality participatory approaches create liberal and socialist dam migrant subjectivities . The former cope with various disincentives and are successfully responsibilized and turned into obedient subjects . The latter are incentivized to be obedient and responsible but instead frequently challenge the local state . Second households which have decided to self organize their resettlement in line with liberal rationalities are socially and economically marginalized regardless of their earlier social status . By applying a governmentality analytics this study thus provides a nuanced picture of processes of marginalization and contestation in the course of dam induced resettlement . Instead of running along the lines of rich and poor marginalization through participation cuts across the economic divide and can better be explained by differentiating between liberal and socialist subjects .
42,The expansion of large scale non discretionary social policy has been one of the most important policy innovations in Latin America in recent decades . While these benefits have reduced the political manipulation of low income citizens discretionary social programswhose distribution follows opaque criteria and are often allocated according to political considerationscontinue to exist . Employing an original survey in Mexico we explore how citizens both beneficiaries and non beneficiaries experience and perceive access to discretionary social programs . While the literature on clientelism emphasizes the distribution of discretionary benefits by party agents in exchange for electoral support a number of recent studies have found that access to discretionary social benefits can also operate through community associations or interest organizations . We conducted a list experiment in our survey to detect whether in the experience or perception of the respondent social benefits are allocated on the basis of partisan campaign support or organizational participation . Our findings reveal that organizational brokerage is at least as important as the much studied role of party mediated clientelism for access to discretionary benefits .
43,Food systems are important sites of economic stress political response and adaptation . Access to food is also an important marker of how well a society distributes its wealth reflecting the state of political accountability economic redistribution and the societys level of commitment to uphold the right to food . The COVID 19 pandemic has exposed the interconnected weaknesses of our food social and economic systems and offers lessons for building more just and resilient food systems . We focus on three lessons learned anew in the pandemic food insecurity both reflects and reinforces inequity food workers are essential yet treated as sacrificial and racialized migrant food workers face unique forms of inequity . These lessons chosen for their ethical salience global relevance and political urgency show how interconnected inequities revealed by the pandemic are undermining resilience . We conclude with specific policy recommendations for redress both within and beyond food systems . This will not be the final global pandemic nor is it the only shock that regions are currently experiencing . COVID 19 is an opening to think about how societies might center justice and equity in efforts to build back better . Governments should take this opportunity to invest in structural changes to reduce persistent inequities in food access due to poverty health outcomes decent work and overall wellbeing especially for racialized communities and migrants .
44,Several countries in Africa have either deployed or considering using digital contact tracing as part of their Covid 19 containment strategy amidst calls for the use of technology to improve the efficiency of traditional contact tracing . We discuss some of the complexities entailed in using DCT in Africa . Adopting a socio technical perspective we argue that if DCT design and deployment are not well thought out it can lead to unintended consequences particularly in a continent like Africa with disproportionate levels of digital divides and other structural inequalities . We suggest that any adoption of DCT by African countries must take account of their compatibility with local resources values social structure and domestic political factors . Accordingly we propose a process of
45,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 developed into a pandemic on March 11 . COVID 19 not only brought life crisis but also incurred psychological stress tension anxiety fear and despair among affected populations . How to help people overcome traumatic stress reactions and get out of psychological crisis has become a public concern that needs to be resolved in time . This article reported the psychological responses caused by the COVID 19 epidemic in China based on relevant experience and studies . The anti epidemic measures of self quarantine and social distancing were deployed to contain the spread of COVID 19 but inevitably caused a certain extent of side effect frustration and anxiety in the general public . Especially the front line medical rescue staff and COVID 19 patients were more susceptible to developing psychological disorders . Correspondingly adaptive strategies and public health policies were rapidly implemented in China to deal with outbreak caused mental stress . The psychological impact of COVID 19 and coping strategies adopted in China provided warning and reference for countries that are and going to be affected by this natural disaster .
46,This paper studies child health focusing on differences in anthropometric outcomes between Christians and non Christians in India . The non Christian group includes Hindus and Muslims . Estimates indicate that young Christian children are less likely to be stunted as compared to similar aged children of Hindu and Muslim identities . The Christian relative advantage is particularly pronounced for girls . Using representative data on child health outcomes and information on the location of Protestant and Catholic missions differences in the relative timing of establishment of missions in the same area political crises that mission establishing countries were engaged in during India s colonial history and historical information from the 1901 Census we find that Christian girls are significantly less likely to be stunted as compared to similarly aged non Christian girls . We find no relative stunting advantage for Christian boys which we attribute to son preference and patriarchy among Hindus in particular . An analysis of explanatory mechanisms indicates that elementary and higher education schools as well as hospitals pharmacies and print shops associated with the advent of Christianity improved the relative human capital of women with subsequent long term implications for young Christian girls in India today . Our results survive a series of robustness and specification checks .
47,Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access . Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions . Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results . Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme . Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders . Here we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes . Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts while others have resource providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit . A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract . Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource providing contracts increase farmers input use and yield . Resource providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production . These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium sized farms . In contrast the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use productivity and scale of production . The results suggest that resource providing contracts alleviate market access constraints while simple marketing contracts do not in this context .

49,We study the effect of spatial inequality on economic activity . Given that the relationship is highly simultaneous in nature we use exogenous variation in geographic features to construct an instrument for spatial inequality which is independent from any man made factors . Our instruments are inequality measures based on grid level data for existing countries as well as for artificial countries . In the construction of the instrumental variable we use both a parametric regression analysis as well as a random forest classification algorithm . Our IV regressions show a significant negative relationship between spatial inequality and economic activity . This result holds if we control for country level averages of different geographic variables . Therefore we conclude that geographic heterogeneity is an important determinant of economic activity .
50,Despite the firm consensus that income inequality is intrinsically undesirable its impact on economic growth is much disputed . We posit that the relationship between income inequality and economic growth is conditioned by the level of equality of opportunity . Our testable hypothesis is simple in societies where opportunities are unequally distributed where the material circumstances of parents act as binding constraints on the opportunities available to their children income inequality exerts a greater drag on future growth . In contrast in societies with a more equal distribution of opportunities an increase in income inequality can be more easily reversed and need not constrain investment opportunities and growth . We identify equality of opportunity with intergenerational mobility that is the degree of the correlation between parents attainments and childrens attainments . We use several recently developed internationally comparable measures of intergenerational mobilityincluding the World Banks comprehensive GDIM databaseto confirm that the negative impact of income inequality on growth is higher the lower is intergenerational mobility . Our results suggest that omitting intergenerational mobility leads to misspecification shedding light on why the empirical literature on income inequality and growth has been so inconclusive .
51,Illegal economic activities are not only associated with higher levels of violent crime they may also increase unforeseen risks and cause other negative unintended consequences for populations . This paper investigates the causal effects of illegal gold mining on malaria incidence . For this purpose I employ unique Colombian satellite data with the location of illegal gold mines matched to municipal governmental health reports on the number of malaria cases . To identify causal effects I use preexisting geochemical gold anomalies as an instrumental variable for illegal gold production . I find positive and large effects of illegal gold mining on malaria incidence . My estimates suggest that when an area containing illegal gold mines increases by 1hectare the annual parasite index for malaria increases by 1.04 cases per 100 000 inhabitants .
52,One of the immediate responses to COVID 19 has been a call to ban wildlife trade given the suspected origin of the pandemic in a Chinese market selling and butchering wild animals . There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal unsustainable or carries major risks to human health biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards . However some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development . There are a number of reasons for this concerns . First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets but the two are not the same thing and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems . Second wildlife trade generates essential resources for the worlds most vulnerable people contributing to food security for millions of people particularly in developing countries . Third wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground making it even harder to regulate and encouraging further livestock production . Fourth in many cases sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on leading to population recoveries . Most importantly a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases habitat destruction largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation and industrial livestock production . We suggest that the COVID 19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation . We make specific suggestions as to what this entails but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts .
53,Migrant workers play a significant role in the economy of Bangladesh pumping approximately USD15 billion into the economy that directly contributes to the socio economic development of Bangladesh every year . These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID 19 . Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment short working hours isolation poor quality of living social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives . A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID 19 in their host countries . Thus COVID 19 intensifies numerous socio economic crises such as joblessness consumption of reserve funds by family members and shrinking of the countrys remittance inflow . In this situation the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh . Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need based and skilled workforce as a long term solution . These strategies can mitigate the impacts of COVID 19 at present and address migration related problems in future .
54,Payments for Ecosystem Services are now a prominent policy instrument for conserving tropical forests . PES are voluntary direct and contractual an ES buyer pays an ES steward for adopting conservation practices for a fixed term . A defining feature of PES is its quid pro quo conditionality e.g . stewards are paid only if they deliver contracted conservation outcomes . Most studies on PES effectiveness focus on the
55,Burkina Fasos 2008 Bt cotton adoption was Africas largest genetically modified crop introduction principally for small farmers and became its most celebrated success story . In 2016 however Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase out of Bt cotton citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality . In hindsight quality issues were conspicuously absent from the success narrative particularly given that cotton sector actors were aware of problems for a decade . Recent data also reveal significantly lower yield gains and substantial inequalities between farmers further questioning the success story and the evaluation literature it relied upon . Why and how was such a faulty and incomplete success narrative produced and promoted To answer this we draw on extended fieldwork conducted over ten years in Burkina Faso to critically examine how the knowledge used to build this success narrative was produced . We first scrutinize the evaluation literature pointing out flaws and blindspots in the methodologies and reporting of findings . We then extend our analysis drawing on political ecology and critical science studies to focus on the power relations of knowledge production . We focus on three themes and show how the political economic context favored the production of positive results with Monsanto holding substantial power over the evaluation process the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation produced apolitical knowledge that overlooked how local level power dynamics shaped data collection and in at least two cases the returns accrued by smaller scale Bt cotton farmers the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to Monsanto and helped to promote GM crops across the continent . We conclude that future GM crop evaluations should be more self reflexive critical and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for differentiated farmers .
56,The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda has been hailed as the most comprehensive and integrated framework for addressing the twin challenges of global environmental change and global development . This all encompassing framework has provided a unique intersection for inter and trans disciplinary critical research and scholarship aimed at interrogating and improving public policy . Nevertheless there are crucial premises underpinning the agenda that have rarely been interrogated or subjected to explicit scrutiny . As a consequence much of the analytical work focusing on the SDGs their targets indicators and the interrelations between these replicates these premises with problematic implications . We demonstrate that the

58,In the context of the major potential impacts of COVID 19 on agriculture and agricultural trade in developing countries this Viewpoint discusses the advantages of adopting a conceptual framework previously used to discuss the impact of the HIV AIDS pandemic on agriculture and rural livelihoods . The framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts 1 Susceptibility or the chance of an individual becoming infected 2 Resistance or the ability of an individual to avoid infection 3 Vulnerability or the likelihood of significant impacts occurring at individual household or community level and 4 Resilience the active responses that enable people to avoid the worst impacts of an epidemic at different levels or to recover faster to a level accepted as normal . This framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for COVID 19 factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible broader socio economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility factors that make farm households food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic and aspects of COVID 19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability . Brief examples of susceptibility of value chain operations and of their vulnerability to COVID 19 lockdown measures are given . A focus on resistance and resilience encourages investigation of local level responses by communities and NGOs which with appropriate monitoring and learning could be scaled up .
59,Remote areas are often characterized by lower welfare outcomes due to economic disadvantages and higher transaction costs for trade . But their poorer situation may also be linked to worse public service delivery . Relying on large household surveys in rural Ethiopia we explore this by assessing the association of two measures of remoteness the distance of service centers to district capitals and the distance of households to service centers with public service delivery in agriculture and health sectors . In the agriculture sector we document statistically significant and economically meaningful associations between exposure to agriculture extension and the two measures of remoteness . For health extension only the last mile matters . These differences between the two sectors could be due to the fact that more remote villages tend to have fewer agriculture extension workers who also put in fewer hours than their peers in more connected areas . This does not apply in the health sector . These findings provide valuable inputs for policymakers aiming to improve inclusiveness in poor rural areas .
60,Womens patterns of time use which proxy the work burdens associated with productive and reproductive activities are an important determinant of nutrition and well being in LMICs . However there is a lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time use translate into patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure particularly in rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important role . We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived from wearable tri axial accelerometers with time use data from conventional recall based surveys . Using datasets from agricultural households in four rural communities in India and Nepal our results show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of time use and energy expenditure . Men and women participate equally in productive work however women shoulder most of the additional reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure opportunities . Our results provide insights into womens responses to opportunities for productive work and highlight the nature of trade offs they face .
61,In India the government launched a US 22.6 billion financial support package for the poor and marginalized as a result of Covid 19 . Approximately US 4.2 billion came from a vast pile of unspent social special purpose funds . How and why did such a large volume of funds accumulate in the first place and why did it take a public health emergency to release them What might be the consequences of their use under such emergency conditions especially for our understanding of governance and accountability in social welfare provision
62,Universal access to safe drinking water will require an investment of over 140 billion in capital expenditures to meet the targets set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . The World Bank estimates that recurring operations and maintenance costs for basic water and sanitation services will rise from about 4 billion to over 30 billion per year by 2030 significantly outweighing capital costs for basic WASH services . Yet available funding from regional national and international sources regularly prioritizes capital investment in new water infrastructure leading to significant unfunded operation and maintenance mandates for service providers operating in low income settings where consumer payments can not practically cover operating costs . Capital maintenance is deferred leading to poor utility financial performance and decreased service for water customers . In this paper we present indicative funding models valuation of existing assets and expenditures of four medium sized urban water utilities in low middle and high income communities representing a broad range of operating contexts . Yet we find common operating challenges . None of the four utilities are spending enough on capital maintenance to sustain service levels and we find that the gap between the life cycle costs of water service delivery and associated revenues of water services ranges from 1 to 17 per customer each year . Discounting life cycle costs by service and coverage levels further widens the funding gap . All utilities would need additional funding to reach universal access with full coverage of life cycle costs ranging from 6 of budgets to nearly 8 times current funding levels . This would not be economically or politically feasible through tariffs alone which are already currently subsidized in all contexts . The contribution of progressive tax monies to subsidize services is taken for granted in high income contexts and unavailable in poorer ones that must rely on insufficient and irregular foreign aid or national budget allocations in strained economies . These findings contrast with a commonly shared view in the global development sector that local or at minimum regional financial sustainability of water supplies is achievable . Consequently our findings suggest that national governments and international donors should acknowledge that long term support of local water service delivery is both necessary appropriate and likely more cost effective than current funding models .
63,The map presented in this brief note summarizes regional differences in population age structures between the NUTS 3 regions of Europe in the context of unequal age and sex specific death risks associated with the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic . Since older people are exposed to much higher death risks older populations are expected to face much more difficult challenges coping with the pandemic . The urban rural dimension turns out to be very important as the remote rural areas are also the oldest . In the map NUTS 3 regions of Europe are colored according to the deviation from European pooled estimate of the proportion of population at risk of death due to COVID 19 . We assume that 5 6 of the populations get infected and experience age specific infection fatality ratios modelled by the Imperial College COVID 19 Response Team . We adjust IFRs by sex ratios of age specific case fatality ratios observed in the European countries that are included in the COVerAGE DB . Thus we effectively introduce a summary measure of population age structures focused on the most vulnerable to the pandemic . Such an estimate for the total European population is 1 . The map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID 19 fatality . It is a case if scenario that highlights the possible effect of the population age structures a demographic perspective . This analysis clearly shows the contribution of regional differences in population age structures to the magnitude of the pandemic other things equal we expect to see a four fold variation in average regional infection fatality ratios across Europe due only to differences in the population structures .
64,Dairy polar lipids seem to exhibit antiplatelet effects . However it is not known what molecular species may be responsible . In this study we confirmed using C30 reversed phase ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometry that fermentation of yoghurts from ovine milk using specific starter cultures altered the PL composition . These lipid alterations occurred concomitant with increased antithrombotic properties of the yoghurts PL fractions against platelet activating factor and thrombin induced platelet aggregation . Specifically elevation in phosphatidylethanolamine sphingomyelin phosphatidylcholine and their molecular species were observed following yoghurt fermentation . Furthermore PC PE SM and several other molecular species were significantly inversely correlated with the inhibition of PAF and thrombin . These molecular species were abundant in the most bioactive yoghurts fermented by

66,Food allergens that cause anaphylactic reactions have become an important health problem worldwide . Among them shrimp is a popular seafood in many cuisines . The best way to avoid allergic reactions is to mitigate the intake of food allergens . In this study a loop mediated isothermal amplification assay was developed for the detection of shrimp DNA . Using LAMP primers the identification of shrimp DNA by the LAMP assay was specific and rapid . It exhibited no cross reaction with the DNA of other Crustacea including crabs and lobster and at least 0.01 shrimp DNA existed in the test sample . Additionally the sensitivity of LAMP for detecting shrimp DNA was 100 fold greater than that of conventional PCR . LAMP for the detection of shrimp DNA was reproducible regardless of whether the genomic DNA was extracted from boiled steamed or roasted shrimp samples . In summary the LAMP assay established herein not only could be potentially used for diagnosing shrimp DNA but could also be applicable for identifying shrimp allergens in commercial food products in marketplaces .

70,Polyphosphates are permitted as food additives but their undeclared utilisation is considered fraudulent . They improve water holding capacity of the seafood preventing biochemical physical changes during commercialization . The key objective of this study was the detection of polyphosphate in various seafood categories by means of high performance ion exchange chromatography with suppressed conductometry coupled to Q Exactive Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry . Ten frozen cuttlefish samples did not reveal any treatment while in ten frigate tunas high concentration of orthophospate was found . Unambiguous hexametaphosphate presence was demonstrated in four prawn samples while triphosphate was quantified in another four prawn samples that contained orthophosphate as well . Other samples sporadically encompassed polyphosphates profiles that varied according species and processing type . This analytical approach provided sustenance in better understanding regarding utilization of polyphosphates through HRMS fingerprinting of anionic species that would be specific in food safety control .
71,Different baking conditions were used in order to evaluate its effects on bread aspects . Doughs were baked at 160 190 and 220C during 9 12 15 and 20min and characterized in relation to color change oxalate and mineral concentration and protein digestibility . The higher the baking temperature and time the higher the crust color change the lower the oxalate concentration and the higher the amount of some macro minerals . Protein digestibility may also be favored however it does not follow a linear correlation . Although it is not possible to obtain a condition that favors the content of all minerals protein digestibility and reduces oxalate content the use of high temperatures and times is important as it can reduce oxalate and thereby prevent its associated problems . Understanding how to optimize it during baking could be used to produce breads with a higher mineral bioavailability an important strategy for food industry and also when using alternative flours .
72,The conjugate prepared from epigallocatechin gallate and soy protein isolate under alkaline and aerobic conditions was analyzed using a Nano LC Q Orbitrap MS MS technique . The sulfhydryl and free amino groups of SPI were involved in covalent binding . Fifty one peptides were conjugated with EGCG . Fifty nine modified sites were identified located on Cys His Arg and Lys respectively . It is the first time to confirm that each of the two phenolic rings of EGCG contained a reactive site that bound to an amino acid residue . The amino acid residue reactivity amino acid sequence and composition affected the EGCG binding site in SPI . Lys and Arg residues are the most likely sites for modification and modification appears to reduce IgE binding . This study is helpful to elucidate the pattern of covalent binding of polyphenols to proteins in food systems and provides a theoretical basis for the directional modification of soy proteins with polyphenols .
73,Tofu gel was made by using citric acid in combination with varied volumetric ratios of nano fish bone . The gel properties were investigated by colorimetry penetration tests scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy . As the volumetric ratio increased from 0 to 3 the soluble calcium concentrations of soymilk linearly increased from 1.78 to 6.42mg mL . Correspondently yield moisture and texture values of the tofu gel increased continuously while syneresis and whiteness decreased . Furthermore ionic bonds hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds increased by 140 40 and 10 respectively . With the addition of NFB the helices of the soybean proteins changed to sheets and random coil structures . Additionally the tofu gel network became more orderly and denser . The results confirmed that NFB can be utilized as a functional coagulant ingredient to improve the properties of acid induced tofu gels .
74,Oil foams that are based on oleogels are stabilized by the presence of crystalline particles at the air bubble surface and in bulk . The size of crystalline particles is an important parameter in oil foam stabilization . The creation process can tune its properties . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of altering the weight ratio between long chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols on the oil foam . Two optimal weight ratios R 7 3 and R 8 2 for which mixed crystals were present produced the best foams in terms of overrun foam firmness and foam stability . R not only affected the crystal size but also the number of crystalline particles present in the oleogel . Mixed crystals help to produce and stabilize the foams . We highlighted that there is a link between the oleogel stability and hardness with their resulting oleofoam properties .

82,In this study metabolomics and proteomics were employed to investigate the change mechanism of nonvolatile compounds during white tea processing . A total of 99 nonvolatile compounds were identified among which the contents of 13 free amino acids caffeine theaflavins 7 nucleosides and nucleotides and 5 flavone glycosides increased significantly while the contents of theanine catechins theasinesins 3 proanthocyanidins and phenolic acids decreased significantly during the withering period . The results of proteomics indicated that the degradation of proteins accounted for the increase in free amino acid levels the weakened biosynthesis in addition to oxidation also contributed to the decrease in flavonoid levels the degradation of ribonucleic acids contributed to the increase in nucleoside and nucleotide levels during the withering period . In addition the drying process was found to slightly promote the formation of white tea taste . Our study provides a novel characterization of white tea taste formation during processing .
83,Mass spectrometry based methods coupled with stable isotope dilution have become effective and widely used methods for the detection and quantification of food allergens . Current methods target signature peptides resulting from proteolytic digestion of proteins of the allergenic ingredient . The choice of appropriate stable isotope labelled internal standard is crucial given the diversity of encountered food matrices which can affect sample preparation and analysis . We propose the use of concatemer an artificial and stable isotope labelled protein composed of several concatenated signature peptides as internal standard . With a comparative analysis of three matrices contaminated with four allergens the concatemer approach was found to offer advantages associated with the use of labelled proteins ideal but unaffordable and circumvent certain limitations of traditionally used synthetic peptides as internal standards . Although used in the proteomic field for more than a decade concatemer strategy has not yet been applied for food analysis .

87,During wheat cultivation glyphosate based herbicides are recommended to be applied a week prior to harvest during the ripe stage of physiological maturity . However some grains may not be at this physiological stage due to non uniform maturation within the field . The goal of this study was to determine the effect of glyphosate based herbicide timing on the chemistry of wheat gluten proteins and shikimic acid accumulation . The results of the study indicate that pre harvest glyphosate application does not impact the amino acid composition protein secondary structure or gluten protein composition . However pre harvest glyphosate application decreased the molecular weight of SDS extractable and unextractable proteins and significantly increased the amount of shikimic acid accumulation especially when applied early . Thus this study indicates that pre harvest use of glyphosate based herbicides can cause significant differences in wheat protein chemistry and shikimic acid levels especially when applied earlier than recommended emphasizing the importance of timely application .
88,The aim of this work was to study the effect of thickness of samples air velocity and infrared power on the drying kinetics and quality attributes of blanched eggplant slices during infrared drying .

Experiments were conducted at a thickness of 3 5 and 7mm air velocity of 0.5 1.25 and 2m s as well as at infrared power 1000 1500 and 2000W . The drying time was affected by operating parameters . The drying processes increased total phenolic content and potassium content significantly . The total color difference
89,Zero salted yellow alkaline noodles were immersed in solutions of resistant starch HYLON VII or fruit coating Semperfresh containing a range of salt between 10 and 30 . The objective was to evaluate the effect of salt coatings on the textural handling cooking and sensory properties of YAN . Increasing salt in the coatings caused a reduction in optimum cooking time cooking loss and increase in cooking yield . The mechanical and textural parameters sensory hardness springiness and overall sensory acceptability of the salt coated noodles however decreased with increasing salt application . HC Na10 and SC Na10 showed the highest textural and mechanical parameters sensory hardness and springiness . The differences in the parameters were attributed mainly to the water absorption properties of starch that was affected by salt application . Thus the quality of salt coated noodles was dependent mainly on the amounts of salt applied in the coatings rather than on the types of coatings used .

106,Ultrasound has been recognized as a non thermal technology for accelerating blueberry wine aging for flavor development . However influence of US on anthocyanin and color characteristics is uncertain . In this study US was applied to new blueberry wine and changes in color characteristics anthocyanin content and anti oxidant capacity were evaluated at early stage of aging period . Low frequency power US resulted in an improvement in color characteristics and lower chromatic aberration as compared to untreated samples specially at condition of 180W 20min and 2 cycles . Furthermore this contribution was attributed to unattenuated anthocyanins protected from US stress . Importantly the structural polarity dependence was mediated by the impact of US on anthocyanins . Additionally anti oxidant activity of blueberry wine was not adversely affected under a moderate US condition . US treatment of blueberry wine was therefore considered to significantly enhance the color presentation hinting at the possibility of promoting blueberry wine aging .

114,The mechanism of flavor retention in chicken broth from the perspective of gelatin affecting the flavor binding ability of emulsions was investigated . Results showed that fat was the important reservoir for aroma compounds in the emulsion . The particle sizes of emulsions significantly decreased with prolonged stewing time of gelatin which was consistent with the results from confocal laser scanning microscopy and interfacial tension . The ability of pre heated gelatin emulsions to bind volatile compounds with higher hydrophobicity was enhanced . When 0.1 gelatin was added into chicken broth the total amount of the main volatile compounds increased from 458.83ng g to 1218.42ng g. In summary the pre heated gelatin increased the interfacial pressure of water oil interface resulting in a smaller particle size of oil droplets and these further increased the binding area between oil droplets and flavor compounds . This appears to be the mechanism that gelatin enhances the flavor intensity of chicken broth .

129,A cascade process for the sequential recovery of proteins and feruloylated arabinoxylan from wheat bran is proposed involving a protein isolation step enzymatic destarching and subcritical water extraction . The protein isolation step combining lactic acid fermentation and cold alkaline extraction reduced the recalcitrance of wheat bran thus improving the total yields of the subsequent subcritical water extraction . The time evolution of subcritical water extraction of feruloylated arabinoxylan was compared at two temperatures . Longer residence times enhanced the purity of target feruloylated arabinoxylans whereas higher temperatures resulted in faster extraction at the expense of significant molar mass reduction . The radical scavenging activity of the extracted feruloylated arabinoxylans was preserved after the initial protein isolation step . This study opens new possibilities for the cascade valorization of wheat bran into enriched protein and non starch polysaccharide fractions which show potential to be used as functional food ingredients .

147,Soybean protein isolate was incubated with flaxseed gum at 60C for 3days under high hydrostatic pressure . Results showed improvement in solubility of SPI upon glycation with FG . The maximum solubility reached 86.84 when SPI FG was treated at pH 8.0 and 200MPa . The occurrence degrees and sites of SPI FG glycation suggested that moderate pressure significantly promoted Maillard reactions but higher pressures suppressed these reactions . The secondary structure of the glycated proteins varied greatly with respect to helix and random coil contents and vibrations of the amide II band at 200MPa . These microstructural changes increased the solubility over a broad pH range . The conformational changes in the glycated SPI supported the improved solubility of SPI FG . Overall HHP represents a potential method of controlling glycation to improve protein processability and expand their applicability in the food industry .
148,The effect of roasting of chia seed at different temperatures on bioactive constituents in extracts and on the quality of oil was evaluated . At higher temperatures crude protein and ash contents increased whereas total phenolic flavonoid carotenoid and antioxidant activities decreased . The predominant phenolic constituents were myrcetin and rosmarinic 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic caffeic and gallic acids which all decreased with increasing temperatures . Notably myrcetin content ranged from 75.59mg 100g to 85.49mg 100g . Tocopherols were predominant nutrients and their levels ranged from 654.86mg 100g to 698.32mg 100g . Concentrations of linolenic linoleic and oleic acids from unroasted chia seeds were higher than those from roasted ones . This study revealed that chia seeds should be heated at temperatures below or equal to 90C in order to preserve their nutrient profile .
149,Poly was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer which was then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy . The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT IR spectroscopy and UVVis spectroscopy . Next the PMel modified GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite NO
150,A new kind of multi component membrane was prepared by combining gelatin solution porogen and an inclusion complex of ionic liquid and beta cyclodextrin in a simple physical manner for selective separation of tea polyphenols from green tea crude extracts . After screening it was found that the resulting membrane containing the IL of dicationic
151,Some halophyte plants are currently used in gourmet cuisine due to their unique organoleptic properties . Moreover they exhibit excellent nutritional and functional properties being rich in polyphenolics and vitamins . These compounds are associated to strong antioxidant activity and enhanced health benefits . This work compared the nutritional properties and antioxidant potential of three species
152,A novel of magnetic dummy template molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared by surface molecular imprinting technique . The structure of polymers were characterized and the binding properties were assessed by adsorption experiments . The synthetic mag MWCNTs DMIPs exhibit satisfying adsorption capacity excellent selectivity and fast adsorption rate toward phenoxy carboxylic acid herbicides . Afterwards a reliable analytical method for selective separation and determination of trace PCA herbicides in cereals was established by using magnetic solid phase extraction and UPLC MS MS detection . A series of requisite factors were optimized in detail to achieve expected extraction performance . Under the optimum MSPE parameters the mean spiked recoveries for analytes in different cereals ranged from 86.7 to 95.2 with intra and inter day precision not greater than 8.5 and 10.6 respectively . At last the developed method was successfully utilized for determination the four PCA herbicides in actual cereals .
153,Enzymatic tenderization is extensively applied in the meat industry whereas its influence on meat flavor has seldom been evaluated . Proteinase K papain bromelain and Flavourzyme were used to treat beef muscle and the changes in volatile compounds and odors were subsequently analyzed . Proteolysis by proteinase K was found to elevate the average bitterness of the identified peptides by generating peptides with high Q values whereas proteolysis by papain generated the highest level of amino acids . Enzymatic treatment by Flavourzyme and bromelain significantly elevated the levels of ketones and odors whereas excessive proteolysis by papain and proteinase K largely reduced the levels of esters and aldehydes . The level of amino acids and degree of hydrolysis were found to be predominant factors that regulated the level of volatiles and odors . These results highlighted the huge influence of enzymatic tenderization on meat flavor depending on degree of hydrolysis and cleavage pattern of applied proteases .
154,Background . Motor development research has seen substantial recent growth . However much remains to be understood about the nature and extent of motor impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders including their potential as early markers and or causal determinants of downstream functioning in other domains . Aims and Methods . In this narrative review drawing primarily on the autism literature by way of example we review current accounts of the nature and consequences of motor functioning . We consider conventional approaches to measurement and study design and current limited approaches to tackling heterogeneity . Conclusions and Implications . We argue that ongoing adherence to traditional diagnostic outcome classification stands in the face of mounting evidence that characteristics of neurodevelopmental disorders lie on a continuum with variability in the general population and that three broad research avenues stand to offer a better understanding of motor functioning The use of technology and advanced statistical methods for a more nuanced understanding of motor abilities exploiting the prospective longitudinal tracking of at risk infants to understand developmental consequences of early motor difference and employing randomized controlled trials to test the utility of motor therapies whilst also testing causal hypotheses about the role of motor functioning .
155,To evaluate the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy using a traditional and a technological intervention in improving the coordination of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder as a primary outcome and the timing and strength control of their movements as secondary outcomes . Twenty two children with ASD completed 8 NMT sessions as a part of a 2 month intervention . Participants were randomly assigned to either use an elastic touch display or tambourines . We conducted pre and post assessment evaluations including the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire and motor assessments related to the control of strength and timing of movements . All participants improved their coordination according to the DCDQ scores and exhibited better control of their movements according to the strength and timing assessments after the intervention . Participants who used the elastic touch display scored higher on the DCDQ . NMT is an efficacious treatment to improve the coordination skills of children with ASD . Elastic touch displays provide more benefits than the use of tambourines .
156,The Test component of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2nd Edition is used worldwide to identify children with Developmental Coordination Disorder . In China practitioners have been using this test with the assumption that the published UK norms are valid for Chinese children . However no systematic investigation has previously been undertaken to check this assumption . 2185 children aged 310 years old from a national representative sample in China were therefore recruited to the current study . Performance on the Movement ABC 2 was assessed and compared with the UK standardization norms . Gender differences were also examined . The comparisons revealed that Chinese children were generally better in Manual Dexterity and Balance tasks compared to their UK peers while UK children were better in Aiming Catching tasks . Further analysis showed an interaction of country and age with mixed results . For both countries girls were generally better in Manual Dexterity and Balance tasks and boys were generally better in Aiming Catching . Possible explanations for the country differences are discussed . The results suggest that local norms for the Movement ABC 2 Test are needed in China .
157,Students with extensive support needs have the ability to learn a variety of mathematical skills when taught using scientifically validated strategies e.g .
158,Many children with developmental coordination disorder have mathematical problems which are more pronounced for mathematical skills that also require executive functions . Although empirical evidence is missing math and special education need teachers of children with DCD report difficulties with mathematical word problem solving that can be remediated by providing the children with scaffolds cueing the intermediate steps . This study aims to find empirical evidence for the effectivity of such additional support . In addition we want to investigate whether the difficulties are due to inefficient arithmetic or executive functioning skills . A DCD and a control group solved word problems with and without scaffolds and conducted a series of tasks measuring calculation and executive skills . Performance improves when scaffolds are presented to children with DCD . Children with DCD and control children differ on executive functioning tasks but perform similarly on arithmetic tests . Providing scaffolds for word problem solving is effective in children with DCD . Scaffolds possibly reduce the required cognitive load making the problem solvable for DCD children that have reduced executive functioning skills .
159,Mathematical difficulties in individuals with Williams Syndrome and in individuals with Down Syndrome are well established . Perceptual subitizing and conceptual subitizing are domain specific precursors of mathematical achievement in typically developing population . This study employed for the first time eye tracking methodology to investigate subitizing abilities in WS and DS . Twenty five participants with WS and 24 participants with DS were compared to a younger group of TD children matched for mental age . Participants were asked to enumerate one to six dots arranged either in a dice or a random pattern . Accuracy rates and analyses of reaction time showed no significant differences between the clinical groups and the control group suggesting that all participants used the same processes to perform the enumeration task in the different experimental conditions . Analyses of the eye movements showed that both individuals with WS and individuals with DS were using inefficient scanning strategies when counting . Moreover analyses of the eye movements showed significantly shorter fixation duration in participants with DS compared to the control group in all the experimental conditions . The current study provides evidence that individuals with WS and individuals with DS perform both perceptual subitizing and conceptual subitizing . Moreover our results suggest a fixation instability in DS group that does not affect their performance when subitizing but might explain their low accuracy rates when counting . Findings are discussed in relation to previous studies and the impact for intervention programmes to improve counting and symbolic mathematical abilities in these populations .
160,A parent coaching intervention program was launched in a Quebec community based organization for autism spectrum disorder . This initiative was intended to support families following the childs diagnosis as they awaited public early intensive behavioral intervention services . The parent mediated intervention program based on the Early Start Denver Model included a 3h parent group training an initial assessment followed by the development of an individualized intervention plan 8 weeks of live coaching a final assessment to evaluate childrens progress and a feedback meeting with families . The present study used a mixed method design to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program . Ten families and four coaches participated in the present study . Parents and coaches perceived and achieved high levels of implementation overall and there was a moderate improvement of parents teaching skills . All participating families and coaches were satisfied or highly satisfied with the program and found it acceptable .
161,Academic outcomes for autistic individuals are heterogeneous but the reasons for this are unknown . Attention is known to predict learning in typical development but there is less evidence about this relationship in Autism Spectrum Disorders even though attention is reported as atypical in this group . To investigate reading and maths achievement profiles for children with and without an ASD focusing on the role of attention in these profiles and to enable a better understanding of individual differences . Reading maths and attention abilities of 22 autistic children and 59 TD children were measured using standardised assessments . A hierarchical cluster analysis that included all children revealed three distinct transdiagnostic subgroups characterised by children with good average and poorer divided attention and academic achievement respectively . Children with poorer attention and achievement displayed relative weaknesses in maths while children with average or above average attention and achievement showed no such weakness . The findings provide a novel insight into the relationship between attention and achievement and understanding individual differences in ASD and typical development .
162,Despite difficulties entering the workforce people on the autism spectrum are often successful . Furthermore they are suggested to bring unique abilities related to the repetitive and restrictive behaviours and interests diagnostic domain that may be advantageous in employment . This critical and systematic review examined evidence supporting the superior workplace performance of employees on the autism spectrum particularly regarding the RRBI domain . A systematic review evaluated empirical peer reviewed studies that assess employees on the autism spectrums performance in the workplace or on work specific tasks . Nine databases were searched with additional papers identified from reference lists and consultation . Two quantitative and four qualitative papers met criteria . Results reflect themes attention to detail tolerance of repetitive tasks special circumscribed interests other RRBI related advantages concerns . Due to the nature and quality of the identified studies there is currently no strong evidence supporting or negating a workplace autism advantage . This review highlights the need for more research and urges constraint in utilising stereotypes that may not apply to all on the autism spectrum arguing an individual differences approach to supporting autism strengths at work .
163,Children with Social Communication Disorder or High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder have persistent deficits in language structure and language use . This feasibility study evaluated a novel parent preference based outcome measure and secondary outcomes associated with the Social Communication Intervention Programme . 15 UK speech and language practitioners identified 20 children aged 511 years with pragmatics language needs . Practitioners received SCIP training and supervision . Children received 20 SCIP therapy sessions . Primary endpoint was a goal attainment scale . Before intervention parents provided three prioritised communication goals refined into a series of steps . After intervention parents and practitioners rated each goal compared to T1 and parents provided a narrative on outcomes . Secondary outcomes Childrens Communication Checklist 2 Social Language Development Test and observational ratings of conversational interaction . All children except one progressed on T2 SCIP GAS parent outcomes . All children progressed on practitioner SCIP GAS ratings . 82.5 of parent comments supported their own SCIP GAS ratings . Secondary outcomes measures Only SLDT Making Inferences scores and TOPICC 2 ratings showed improvement at T2 . A preference based social communication measure showed feasibility as an outcome measure following social communication intervention for children who have HFASD or SPCD .
164,Individuals with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning are at high risk for developing post traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders . In individuals without MID BIF Seeking Safety is found to be effective in treating PTSD and SUD simultaneously . However little is known about integrated treatment of PTSD and SUD in individuals with MID BIF . This review aims to provide an overview of studies about this type of triple psychopathology as well as PTSD or SUD in individuals with MID BIF . No studies were found on integrated treatment of PTSD and SUD in individuals with MID BIF . Thirty two studies were found on treatment of either PTSD or SUD in individuals with MID BIF . Only 9.4 of these studies mentioned the co morbidity of PTSD and SUD . Suggestions for adapting treatment to individuals with MID BIF were provided on communication structure non verbal elements network coping skills therapeutic relationship and use of suitable and reliable instruments to measure treatment progress . More research is needed on the effectivity of EMDR or Imaginary Exposure combined with SUD treatment and on the adaption of SeSa tot individuals with MID BIF as well as on this type of triple psychopathology in general .
165,Public support for the rights of persons with intellectual disability and their acceptance in local communities has been rarely studied internationally and the variables associated with more positive attitudes remain to be confirmed . To develop and test a model that brought together personal organisational and national predictors related to public attitudes that have been previously identified in past research . Self completed online surveys were undertaken with market research panels in 17 countries and in eight cities in the USA with a total of 36 508 respondents who were representative in terms of gender and age . Path analysis was used to explore the inter relationships among the predictor possible mediating and outcomes variables . The resulting model was a good fit for the data . Support for the rights and community acceptance of people with ID was highest among university educated respondents those who were comfortable at meeting people with ID and those living in countries with very high ratings on the Inequality Adjusted Human Development Index . The model could guide further research into public attitudes alongside the development of interventions to promote more positive attitudes . Further research into the validity of the model is proposed .
166,It has been hypothesised that deficits in the functions of predictive motor control and internal modeling may contribute to motor control issues of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder . Virtual reality technologies have great potential to provide opportunity for Motor observation and motor imagery which could enhance learning and development of motor skills in children with DCD . Thus the present study aimed to investigate the benefits of a VR training intervention to improve predictive motor control functions of children with DCD . Forty female children with DCD were randomly assigned to VR and control groups . In this study an experimental pre post and follow up design was used and Predictive motor control functions were measured before and after the VR intervention and two months later . Predictive motor control was evaluated using MI action planning and rapid and online control tests . VR intervention consisted of a selection of Xbox 360 Kinect games that were performed for sixteen 30 min sessions over 8 weeks . Compared to the control group the VR group improved significantly on measures of MI motor planning and rapid and online control scores from pre to post test and retained their performance to follow up . Overall it seems that virtual reality training program may be used as an appropriate intervention approach for developing the ability of MI and predictive motor control functions in DCD children .
167,The dual task paradigm is an ecologically valid approach to assess cognitive function in relation with motor demands particularly for children with Down syndrome . This study aimed to determine DT performance for a complex Change of Direction walking task in children with DS . The sample included 12 children with DS 12 typically developing children matched for chronological and 12 TD children matched for mental age . We examined DT performance with the Trail Walking Test participants walked along a fixed pathway following a prescribed path delineated by target markers of increasing sequential numbers and increasing sequential numbers and letters . Motor and cognitive dual task costs were calculated . For the TWT an ANOVA with repeated measures revealed significant differences between DS and the CA but not the MA group . Overall there were significant decreases in speed with increasing cognitive demands . In addition all children produced higher cognitive compared to motor DTC which were more pronounced in the cognitively more challenging condition . The assessment of motor and cognitive performance in a DT paradigm provided insight in how motor and or cognitive impairment constrains the ability of children to successfully perform activities in a complex and dynamical environment .
168,This paper reviews and discusses research on arithmetical strengths and weaknesses in children with specific developmental cognitive disabilities . It focusses on children with dyslexia developmental language disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism . In general studies show that arithmetical weaknesses are commoner in children with any of these disorders than in controls . Autism is sometimes associated with specific strengths in arithmetic but even in autism it is commoner for arithmetic to be a relative weakness than a relative strength . There may be some genetic reasons why there is an overlap between mathematical difficulties and other developmental learning difficulties but much of the reason seems to be that specific aspects of arithmetic are often influenced by other factors including language comprehension phonological awareness verbal and spatial working memory and long term memory and executive functions . The findings discussed here will be discussed in relation to Penningtons Multiple Deficit Model .
169,Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder show a heightened drive toward systemizing which is the capability to analyze or the drive to construct a rule based system . In addition executive function deficits as well as diminished language capacity and vocabulary have been consistently demonstrated in individuals with ASD . The primary purpose of this study was to create a model to understand how these constructs interact in children with ASD . Forty six children diagnosed with ASD along with their parents and teachers participated . All children completed standardized vocabulary testing . For each child one parent and one teacher completed executive function and systemizing scales . For parents and teachers systemizing was significantly associated with vocabulary . For parents systematizing was significantly associated with all executive function subscales however for teachers systemizing was only significantly associated with half of the executive function subscales . The mediation model indicated that the relationship between vocabulary and systemizing was fully mediated by executive function for parents but the model was not significant for teachers . This model demonstrates that systemizing vocabulary and executive function should not be studied in isolation when attempting to understand the behaviors of children with ASD and can help us to better plan educational and therapeutic interventions .
170,Positive dimension of mental health has gained less attention in previous research on individuals with neurodevelopmenal disorders . However knowledge on factors associated with mental well being is crucial for planning effective interventions for this target group . The aim of the study was to investigate the determinants of positive mental health among young adults with neurodevelopmental disorders . The study sample consisted of 171 young adults with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or ADHD ADD . The data were collected with questionnaires . The mean score of SWEMWBS was 20.98 . Provisions of social relationships functional capacity and self rated state of health associated independently with positive mental health . The level of positive mental health of study participants was relatively low compared with previous studies in other clinical settings or general populations . Promotion of social competence and social relationship should be included in rehabilitation programmes targeted at individuals with neurodevelopmental disorder . This may be beneficial in reaching also other goals set for the rehabilitation such as increasing capacity to work or study .
171,Childrens executive functioning is often negatively associated with a developmental language disorder and positively related to bilingualism . However both regarding children with DLD and bilingual children findings are mixed and few studies have investigated the combination of DLD and bilingualism in relation to EF . This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on childrens EF development . Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical development TD Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to TD peers which could partly be explained by verbal short term memory limitations . Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and morphology skills and were most pronounced at time 1 . Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits which are partly secondary to verbal short term memory weaknesses . Bilinguals performed better on EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for . This effect was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 56 years .
172,Student focused planning has emerged as a primary indicator of post school success . However without mandated policies or procedures in place for transition planning in Australia students with autism will continue to be minimally engaged or completely disengaged from the transition planning process in schools . This is likely to significantly impact post school outcomes for these students . While previous studies have investigated the extent of student involvement in their IEP transition planning meetings none of these studies considered the views of students with autism despite research suggesting that children are experts of their own experiences and their own lives . The aim of the current study was to determine how involved students with autism were in the transition planning process . Interviews were conducted with 18 students with autism aged 1518 years . Interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis . The results revealed that students lacked knowledge of the transition planning process however many students expressed the desire to be significantly involved in the process . The majority of students reported that they only contributed minimally during meetings . Numerous students reported being unaware of existing transition practices that were in place for them . There is an urgent need for transition planning to be mandated in Australia to allow students with disabilities to receive appropriate support in school .
173,Researchers seldom focus on the services needed for Hispanic children with ASD especially in regard to physical activity . The purpose of this study was to explore why Hispanic families with children with ASD seek out and participate in PA and to describe the strategies and supports needed by Hispanic families of children with ASD to improve PA participation . Participants in this descriptive qualitative study were Hispanic parents of children with ASD who participated in one on one semi structured telephone interviews . Interviews were transcribed and then analyzed using thematic line by line analysis . Two major themes emerged from the data 1 Personal Responsibility and 2 Every Day is a Different Challenge . Parents were motivated to engage in PA because of perceived health benefits for themselves and their children . Parents faced famililal and external barriers that impacted their participation . Participants commented on the role of culture in the context of these barriers . Further research is needed regarding culturally responsive PA interventions for Hispanic families with children with ASD .
174,In Italy due to the COVID 19 emergency hospitals and health services were required to undergo rapid changes in organization and assistance delivery in order to control the epidemic outbreak . The confinement of the population and the outbreak impact on health care systems disrupted the routine care for non COVID 19 patients . Particular challenges have been faced for services working with neurodevelopmental disabilities and pediatric neurological disorders . We present the adaptation of our Child Neurology and Developmental Neuropsychology Service at the Developmental Neurology Unit which is responsible for cognitive and behavioral assessment of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological diseases on an inpatient outpatient basis to the epidemic outbreak . In particular we describe the introduction of telehealth in clinical practice and provide qualitative and quantitative data regarding the feasibility of the telemedicine protocol and the level of satisfaction experienced by families . Patients admitted on an inpatient basis are limited to non deferrable cases all patients do pre admission screening to exclude COVID 19 infection . Child neurologists and psychologists have switched the out patient visits to telemedicine sessions despite they had little to no previous experience in telemedicine . Families response to the proposal of video sessions has been positive with 93 of families accepting it preparing appropriate devices and conditions to participate at home . Main barriers to tele sessions access were socio economic and linguistic disadvantage together with familiar health issues . The Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire revealed high level of agreementi between expected care and actual care received by patients and caregivers . The experience of our Service confirms the importance of an inclusive response to emergency with respect to people with disabilities ensuring the quality and continuity of care in times of population quarantine . Our experience could be useful worldwide to evaluate the feasibility of the Italian emergency response applied to the assistance of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities .
175,Even though it has been widely known that parents influence physical activity behaviors of children without disabilities there is no consensus about the effects of parents on PA behaviors of children with disabilities . The purpose of this study was to systematically review published literature examining the effects of parents on PA behaviors of children with disabilities . A systematic literature search was performed in three databases . The search identified 13 studies which met predetermined inclusion criteria . Of the 13 studies 10 studies were conducted in United States and Canada . The remaining three studies were from three different countries Italy Australia and Hong Kong . From the 13 studies 24 parental factors were identified and categorized into four different dimensions a The associations between parental factors and PA behaviors in children with disabilities varied depending on the dimensions of the parental factors . Further studies are warranted to confirm the association between parental factors and PA behaviors in children with disabilities including cross cultural comparisons .
176,Individuals with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability more frequently experience potentially traumatic events and may be more vulnerable to trauma related symptoms . However it is unclear how such symptoms are captured on tools used for behavioural and psychiatric assessment in this population . To explore whether and how PTEs are associated with symptom reports in adults with ASD and ID . Associations and group differences for death of a close relative and serious disease injury in a close relative caregiver friend were explored in a clinical sample of 171 adults with ASD and ID referred for psychiatric assessment . Symptoms were measured using Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Psychopathology in Autism Checklist . Disease injury was associated with higher scores on ABC irritability ABC hyperactivity and self injurious behaviour . Death was associated with lower scores on ABC lethargy and ABC stereotypic behaviour . Some associations reached significance only when controlling for ASD ID or verbal language skills but the identified associations were not robust . No associations were found for PAC . There is a risk of under appreciating the impact of PTEs in this population unless ASD ID and verbal language skills are taken into account .
177,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has been associated with hyperfocus a transient experience of enhanced attentional focus and diminished awareness of time and the environment . This study aims to investigate the association between the frequency duration and pervasiveness of hyperfocus across different situations in adults with and without ADHD . Within a healthy sample assessed in different studies which need to be addressed in future research .
178,While COVID 19 outbreak has had adverse psychological effects in children with special needs the mental state and burden on their caregivers during this pandemic has yet to be reported . The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID 19 outbreak . Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics use and perspective on tele rehabilitation homecare therapy caregivers strain and mental health . The prevalence of depression anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 20.5 and 36.4 respectively . A significant difference in caregiver strain This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID 19 outbreak . We identified several factors associated with poor mental health and perceived strain that can be used to help safeguard caregivers .
179,Research shows that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder are burdened with childcare responsibilities and at increased risk for elevated stress and poor family quality of life . Little is known however about the dynamic interactions between mothers and fathers perceived parenting stress in relating to parental involvement and FQOL especially in the Chinese cultural context . This study examined the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of parenting stress on parental involvement and FQOL for families of children with ASD in mainland China . A total of 210 Chinese couples total Both parents parenting stress was negatively associated with their own involvement and FQOL . Moreover fathers parenting stress was indirectly related to mothers perceptions of FQOL through their involvement in the care of their child with ASD . The findings highlight the important roles of fathers parenting stress and involvement in affecting their own and their partners satisfaction with FQOL within Chinese families raising a child with ASD .
180,Insomnia is highly prevalent in children with neurodevelopmental disorders yet little research exists on sleep treatment access utilization and provision in this population . This study explores barriers and facilitators to access use and provision of treatment for sleep problems as experienced by parents of children with NDDs including Autism Spectrum Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Cerebral Palsy and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and health care professionals who work with children with these conditions . Transcripts from online focus groups and interviews conducted separately with parents of children with NDDs parent factors and the challenging intensive nature of sleep treatment . Facilitators included positive beliefs and attitudes education support and ability to modify treatments for NDD symptoms . Barriers and facilitators were similar across all four NDDs . Results highlight a need for more education about sleep in NDDs and to develop accessible interventions as well as the potential of a transdiagnostic approach to sleep treatment in this population .
181,Playfulness is well known to be vital for child development . However not much is known regarding One hundred forty two families living in Israel and their children aged 47 years participated in the study . Parent child play interaction was videotaped and coded for parental playfulness . Parents reported on child BP using the CBCL questionnaire . Parents in the ID group showed lower levels of playfulness compared to parents in the TD group . Fathers playfulness acted as a moderator in the link between developmental status and child BP . These results highlight the unique role of fathers playfulness in the developmental status of a child diagnosed with ID .
182,There is increasing evidence that children with developmental coordination disorder have deficits in sensory motor integration but it is unclear whether the sense of agency generated by sensory motor integration is altered . To investigate whether there is a difference in the time window for SoA between children with DCD and typically developing children . An agency attribution task was used to quantitatively measure and compare the time window for SoA in 15 children with DCD and 46 children in the TD group . Variables that correlated with the time window for SoA were also examined in both groups of children . The time window for SoA was significantly extended in children with DCD compared to TD children . The time window for SoA in TD children was significantly associated with manual dexterity whereas the time window for SoA in children with DCD was significantly associated with depressive tendency . The time window for SoA is altered in children with DCD . The present results suggest that there may be a bidirectional relationship between an internal model deficit and depressive tendency and SoA in children with DCD .
183,The presence of child disabilities might affect the amount of caregiving attention the child receives with potential ramifications on the development of the child and increasing the likelihood of developing a more severe condition . Little is known about the association between child disabilities and caregiving practices in less developed countries penalized by both lack of data and a research bias toward western societies . In this study we apply data mining methods on a large Our results highlight that compared to other types of disabilities intellectual disabilities increased the risk of being neglected by the caregiver in those activities oriented to the cognitive development . The education of the caregiver and the socioeconomical development of the country are actively involved in the moderation of the risk . We demonstrated that educational policies of parental training such as psychoeducation regarding intellectual disabilities and destigmatization campaigns are needed to benefit parental practices in low and middle income countries .
184,Studying sit to stand in children with Cerebral Palsy addressing the domains of ICF allows determining the factors influencing STS in this population . To systematically review the literature on STS in children with CP identifying which ICF domains have been assessed and how they relate to sit to stand . A literature search was conducted in electronic databases by combining the keywords AND AND . We included cross sectional articles published in English that assessed STS movements in children with CP up to 18 years old . 25 articles met the inclusion criteria . All of them assessed Body Functions and Structure . According to them body alignment muscle strength and postural sway affect STS movement . Six studies related Activity and Participation with STS demonstrating that worse scores in scales that evaluate activities and participation are related to the poorer STS execution . Contextual factors were addressed in 15 studies childrens age bench height manipulation of sensory information and mechanical restriction impact the way children execute STS . Contextual factors and Body Functions and Structure impact the STS in children with CP . However few studies have evaluated the participation of these children . Based on the theoretical framework of the ICF it is important that future studies evaluate functional tasks in children with CP and the components that can affect them . The adoption of the biopsychosocial model strengthens the understanding of functioning which can contribute to rehabilitation planning .
185,Specific learning disorders are common as is their comorbidity . It has been suggested that the core cognitive deficit in dyscalculia is an impairment in numerical magnitude processing similarly in dyslexia phonological processing deficits are considered to be the main cognitive deficit . Cognitive theories on comorbid dyslexia dyscalculia have suggested a number of hypotheses about which cognitive deficits underlie the comorbidity . However few studies have thus far directly compared the abovementioned cognitive correlates of dyscalculia and dyslexia .
186,In recent years consumers emotional responses have been found to be an important complement to sensory and hedonic evaluations for the prediction of food choice and consumption behaviour . Given this trend it is essential that the influence of contextual variables on emotion are investigated . The present study contributes to the discussion with an investigation of the effect of social context on implicit emotional responses to food images . 87 participants viewed food images of varying acceptability either alone with a stranger or with a friend . Subjective liking ratings were measured using a labelled affective magnitude scale and facial muscle activity from zygomaticus major corrugator supercilii and levator labii superioris were measured with an EMG recording system . Controlling for individual differences in facial expressivity and food image acceptability using linear mixed models it was found that the presence of a co acting stranger facilitated muscle activity indicative of a disgust response increased the strength of relationship between muscle activity and subjective liking ratings and led to lower subjective liking overall . No differences in muscle activity or subjective liking were found between subjects who participated alone and with a co acting friend . This suggests that the influence of social context is complex where the relationship between the subject and the social environment can impact both hedonic and emotional evaluations of food stimuli . These findings indicate that facial EMG can be a useful dynamic and implicit measure of emotion in consumer research but it is critical to consider the social context of the testing environment .
187,Current lifestyles always pose increasing time pressure that can result in unhealthy diets . Our study addresses the role that high quality plant based convenience foods can play in promoting healthier consumptions . While convenience foods are in fact often associated with poor nutritional values the spread of healthy convenience foods could respond to the needs of new lifestyles and promote better food choices . The study is based on a multicomponent model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour that has made it possible to verify how control factors such as cooking skills product availability budget time pressure and interest in healthy eating can affect the consumption of precooked plant based foods . The results of Structural Equation Models applied to a sample representative of the Italian population highlight the presence of a consistent group of consumers that consider plant based convenience foods as a useful means to improve their diet . For this cluster the control factors that significantly influence behaviour are market availability interest in healthy eating and time pressure . The advancements in knowledge that this research produces are translated into guidelines for producers retailers and policy makers that in synergy might encourage consumers to replace unhealthy foods with healthy ones .
188,Intensive cattle production is one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss . Pasture based animal husbandry has the potential to reverse this negative trend . Pasture raised livestock products represent a premium niche with an extra value through a cleaner environmental footprint and care for animal welfare including wildlife . This review focuses on recent scientific findings in consumer behavior regarding pasture raised products . A systematic literature search was conducted in online databases using a fixed search term . Thirty nine relevant consumer studies published between 2000 and 2019 in the English language were selected for the review . The Alphabet Theory was applied as a theoretical framework to analyze the findings .
189,Current food trends such as healthy eating plant based diets and sustainability encourage consumers to eat more vegetables . However it is a challenge for many including the younger generations to meet the dietary recommendations regarding vegetable intake . The purpose of this study was to investigate if vegetable convenience products can increase the daily intake of vegetables among young consumers .
190,Grandparents are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the nutrition environment and eating behaviours of their grandchildren . Yet research assessing the various feeding practices of grandparents and the association between grandparents engagement in these practices and the nutritional quality of the food consumed by their grandchild is limited . Accordingly the present study examined the feeding practices of grandparents who report providing childcare to their grandchildren developed and tested a model linking the various practices of grandparent caregivers to the frequency with which their grandchildren consume healthy and unhealthy foods while in grandparental care and explored the socio demographic predictors of engagement in feeding practices . An online survey was administered to grandparents who reported providing regular care to at least one grandchild aged 314years
191,Recent studies have pointed out some cross modal correspondences between flavoured beverages as well as basic taste solutions and specific geometric visual cues . Some of them associate known drink tastes to shapes of receptacles . In particular sweetness is associated with curved receptacles and bitterness with sharp angled ones . Our study aimed to test the hypothesis according to which near threshold solutions might also activate this cross modal correspondence . We used two different cup forms one curved and the other sharp angled with pure sweet and bitter solutions just above sensorial thresholds . We designed two tasks using a two alternative forced choice test . Participants had to decide which drink was sweeter Task 1 and bitterer Task 2 from the curved and sharp angled cups . Results showed the cross modal correspondence but only when participants drank first from the curved cup and second from the sharp angled cup . The effect disappeared when participants drank first from the sharp angled cup and second from the curved cup . This suggests that the correspondence emerges using sweet and bitter near threshold solutions in specific conditions . On the other hand results also showed that confidence level of responses was significantly higher in the bitter task than in the sweet task . We discuss these complex results in the light of different theoretical proposals to explain this cross modal correspondence .
192,Consumers physiological responses such as heart rate electrodermal responses and frontal alpha activity can enhance the understanding of the consumers food experience . This study looked at physiological responses of the autonomic nervous system as a measure for level of arousal and to responses of the central nervous system as a measure for approach withdrawal motivational tendency to accepted and non accepted solutions and drinks .
193,Front of package nutrition labels are designed to help consumers evaluate the healthiness of foods and to promote healthier food choices . In this study an online experiment with Swiss consumers
194,The Dietary Guidelines for Americans stress the importance of a diet high in vegetables however intake remains low . Recently we found that self identified low vegetable consumers ate the recommended daily amounts of vegetables when they were provided
195,Immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality have been recently explored in the field of food consumption studies from different perspectives . The present study utilized virtual reality technology in a within subject experiment with three conditions to examine whether a varying virtual eating environment can alter consumers emotional responses to the eating situation and whether the resulting emotional responses correlate with consumers wanting liking and hedonic evaluations of healthy and unhealthy snacks . In addition the study analyzed whether a virtual eating environment that generates a positive emotional response can raise consumers rating of a healthy snack to the same level as an unhealthy snack consumed in a plain unimmersed environment . The results showed a correlation between positive emotional responses and the pre tasting evaluations of both snacks . In terms of hedonic evaluations positive emotional responses correlated mainly with consumers evaluation of the unhealthy snack . When pre tasting wanting and liking evaluations are compared between experimental conditions the results indicate that a healthy snack is rated higher in a virtual reality environment that induces a more positive emotional response . The healthy snack was also rated at the same level as the unhealthy snack consumed in a plain environment . No differences between conditions were observed in consumers hedonic evaluations of the products . EEG and heart rate measurement results indicate that this might be because tasting a healthy snack generates more cognitive processing than an unhealthy snack . This might reduce the influence of the virtual eating environment on consumers evaluations . To conclude virtual reality technologies might have the potential to support consumers eating experiences and healthy food choices by improving their evaluations of the products .
196,Food package labels can significantly influence food portion size choice . In this research we investigate whether package labels featuring the word surprise influence food portion size choice of hedonic snacks . Surprise appeals are used frequently by the food industry to encourage product choice but their effect on portion size choice is not yet well understood . In four experimental studies we investigate the effect of surprise labelswithout changing the level of information about the producton food portion size choice . We consistently find that surprise labels compared to conventional labels increase food portion size choice . We furthermore show that this effect is driven by an increase in anticipated enjoyment associated with the surprise labeled snack . Theoretically our findings contribute to literature on the implications of the halo effect in food portion size choice by showing that a surprise label triggers a positive halo effect and thereby increases portion size choice .
197,In the last decade considerable interest was given to the measurement of emotional responses to samples . Such measures were designed to go beyond liking and better understand how the actual product with or without a context could elicit positive of negative emotions that help inform overall product performance . Products can be optimised according to their emotions profile as well as their sensory profile and such information is valuable from a marketing point of view as it opens new doors for advertising claims etc . What needs further investigation is how relevant and how valid this information is . In recent studies it was argued that emotional responses are not so much driven by the samples themselves but by the context gravitating around the samples and around the assessors .
198,At Australian wine shows public tastings after formal judging provide an efficient condition for consumer preference testing to identify wine styles that are both liked and innovative . The aim of this study was to devise a method to conveniently obtain that information . We developed a new method relative preference mapping based on projective mapping and using relative scoring to make the task cognitively less demanding . Using wine consumers we tested the concept of a two dimensional labelled map to identify an innovative product and determined the level of difficulty in using a map scale .. The RPM method highlighted innovative wine styles those wines that were simultaneously liked and considered different to a reference . Liking results from the RPM method were similar to results from the traditional 9 point hedonic scale providing validity for the preference component of the new method . RPM conveniently and simultaneously identifies preferred and innovative wine styles in a 2D product map a unique contribution that no other scale is capable of achieving .
199,Since a variety of packaging and containers have become commercially available in the market there has been a rapidly growing interest in the influences of hand feel touch cues on consumer perceptions and emotional responses toward food and beverage products . This study aimed to determine whether hand feel touch cues of cup sleeve materials could be associated with imagined and consumed basic tastes and thereby affect the perception of brewed coffee . Participants were asked to evaluate twelve different cup sleeve materials with respect to evoked emotions and their degree of matching with each of the four basic taste qualities and brewed coffee related flavor attributes . Individual cup sleeve materials were found to be more associated with specific taste qualities coffee related flavors and emotions . Hand feel touch cues of different sleeves were also found to be associated with taste qualities consumed . For example towel linen stainless steel and cardboard materials were matched with sweet salty sour and bitter taste qualities respectively . Specific physical characteristics of cup sleeve materials were found to be involved in mediating such cross modal associations between hand feel touch and taste cues . In Study 3 participants were asked to evaluate brewed coffee samples in paper cups both with cardboard sleeves and those made from the other test materials . While participants rated black coffee samples with a towel sleeve less bitter than those with a cardboard sleeve such differences were not observed in other pairwise comparisons . In conclusion this study provided empirical evidence that hand feel touch cues can be associated with specific taste or coffee related flavor attributes thereby modulating consumer perception of brewed coffee .
200,A panellists experience with a specific sensory method can influence product differentiation during a sensory task . Projective mapping and ultra flash profiling have been used extensively to create a description of food products . The objective of this study was to identify how familiarization with a specific sensory method can influence the results . As such this study compares the results of a PM and UFP task completed by experienced panellists to the results from trained panellists nave consumers and individuals who are employed in the wine industry . All panellists evaluated eight single varietal white wines produced in Nova Scotia Canada . The experienced panellists in this study had experience with the PM task however they did not have experience or knowledge about the products being tested . There was no significant correlation between nave consumers and the experienced panellists . However there was a high similarity between the results of the experienced panellists and the trained panellists . The experts results were significantly different from the other participants . The results of this study indicate that knowledge of the sensory method effects the panellists evaluations and that experienced panellists may be a viable option to evaluate food products when time resources or samples are limited . More studies need to be done to explore the use of experienced panellists to evaluate different food products .
201,Current meat consumption habits will need to change especially those of Western consumers . The level of meat consumption is unsustainable and a recent study estimates a necessary reduction of 90 of the current intake . Insects are a promising alternative to existing protein sources but previous literature has emphasised the initial level of disgust displayed towards insects as a food option . The overall aim of this paper is to understand the attitude of consumers towards eating insects also termed entomophagy in order to outline the barriers that prevent adoption and provide insights in order to overcome these . Data were collected through an online questionnaire with a representative sample of Danish consumers . Several constructs from the literature were measured food neophobia disgust intention to try and intention to eat regularly . In addition a new attitude scale was used that specifically measures the attitude towards entomophagy . A discrete choice experiment was a part of the questionnaire . Using LatentGold 5.1 a segmentation analysis based on the choice experiment was conducted . The influences of intention were analysed using hierarchical regression in SPSS 25 . Results of the choice experiment indicate that different segments of consumers of entomophagy exist and that different segments are interested in different types of insects . Younger consumers and males are more positive towards entomophagy in general and the insect options in the choice experiment . Results of the regression analysis indicate that the attitude toward eating insects is multidimensional and that there seem to be indications of attitude ambivalence in all segments . The interest in entomophagy is important as it will be a key factor in overcoming the barrier of disgust and turning insects into an acceptable food choice in the Western world .
202,In human research images of food are often used as cues in place of real foods . To elicit anticipatory responses in targeted populations cultural differences and population norms with regard to food preferences need to be considered . This pilot study aimed to construct two image paradigms for experimental use within the Australian population . A dataset of 200 images from the licenced database
203,This study aimed to further the development and application of the Global profile approach by extending it to another product category alcoholic cocktails investigating the relationship between sensory emotions context appropriateness in consumers differing for liking patterns and integrating the approach beyond product differentiation to consumer differentiation thus improving and gaining a further insight into differences among consumers . This was done taking into account consumer differences in oral responsiveness personality traits familiarity explicit responses to products and implicit attitudes towards brand .
204,Craft beer is a product category that continues to expand and craft beer drinkers are generally differentiated from traditional beer drinkers in terms of their preference for innovative beers with novel and complex flavor profiles and greater involvement in beer and product focused behaviors and activities . The present research explores the existence of flavor driven segments within the overall craft beer segment where some declared craft beer drinkers exhibit the characteristic craft beer preference while others exhibit a preference for less complex and more traditional flavors . Research conducted with craft style and traditional style beers confirmed such preference segments in a group of male New Zealanders . The preference segments perceived the sensory and holistic conceptual characteristics of the beers similarly . However they differed in specific attitudes and behaviors toward craft beers that were associated with the extent of their use and exposure to craft beers . The presence of the two preference segments was interpreted as being the result of a normal transition of declared craft beer drinker preferences away from the lighter flavors of the traditional style beers to which they had been accustomed and toward the more novel and robust flavors of craft beers . This shift in flavor preferences is tentatively attributed to the same exposure effects that are responsible for flavor preference development in other foods and beverages . The implications for craft and traditional brewers are discussed and suggestions for future research presented .
205,Check All That Apply and Free Comment provide a so called contingency table containing citation counts of words or descriptors by products . This table is most often analysed using correspondence analysis . CA aims at decomposing dependence between products and descriptors into axes of maximal and decreasing dependencies which is reasonable if the dependence has been previously established by a chi square test . However the p value of this test is not valid when the observations are not independent or when the contingency table contains too many low expected citation rates . In addition rejecting independence with a chi square test only means that at least the first CA axis captures some dependence . This paper presents a test to determine the number of axes of the CA that capture significant dependence and proposes a Monte Carlo approach to compute valid p values for this test . The variability in the products coordinates in the CA space is often evaluated by means of a total bootstrap procedure . The paper proposes to rely on this test to determine the number of axes to consider for the Procrustes rotations of such a procedure . Finally to investigate which words are cited more often for each product the paper proposes performing Fishers exact tests per cell on the derived contingency table obtained by reversing the CA computations on the axes capturing significant dependence . The benefits of accounting for the dimensionality of the dependence in the analyses are demonstrated on real CATA data .
206,The aim of this work was to explore based on language of experts and consumers how they define the concept of gastronomy and Mexican cuisine applying the Theory of Social Representation . Gastronomy has become very relevant in the recent years and numerous researches on the matter have been published . Likewise gastronomy has become one of the main drivers for tourists to travel to a certain destination such as Mexico whose traditional cuisine has been included within the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO . This research was carried out in two phases the first one through 22 semi structured interviews with chefs who work in public and private schools of gastronomy in Mexico and the second one through a convenience sampling in Central Mexico with a sample of 329 Mexican consumers . Information was obtained through Open Ended questions Word Association technique and Free Listing task . Interviews were recorded transcribed and analyzed through content analysis . The words or terms obtained from the WA were grouped into categories by means of lemmatization process . Through FL there were obtained the main foods ingredients or dishes of Mexican cuisine and Cognitive Salience Index was calculated . Results of this research establish that gastronomy is a complex concept and that the social representation of chefs and consumers are related with traditional and human aspects sensory characteristics of foods apart from techniques methods and forms of food preparation . In this sense the categories foods and ingredients that characterize Mexican cuisine are discussed based on the language of experts and consumers applying the Theory of Social Representation .
207,The tetrad is a popular sensory discrimination method used widely in the sensory and consumer fields . This short communication provides a novel concise and elegant form of the psychometric function based on a noncentral
208,Consumers and policy makers interest in local foods is growing . Accordingly researchers are also increasingly paying attention to the consumption of local foods . Studies have identified preference for local foods as an emergent consumer ideology called locavorism but they have not yet addressed its antecedents or put it into a theoretical context . In addition extant research provides several insights into local food buying behaviour in developed economies however studies simultaneously conducted in developed and emerging economies are lacking . To address these research gaps this study develops a conceptual framework with proposed relationships among values beliefs and attitudes towards and intentions to purchase local foods in China and Denmark . We conducted an online survey in China and Denmark that evaluated our constructs with pre developed multiple item measures . Using structural equation modelling to test the integrated model we find that values and long term orientation are antecedents of consumer beliefs but the influences of values on consumer beliefs differ between collectivistic dominated China and individualistic dominated Denmark . Specifically collectivistic values are significantly and positively related to locavorism in both countries while individualistic values are strongly linked to locavorism only in Denmark collectivistic values have no effects on fresh start mindset for the two samples but individualistic values are significantly and positively related to a fresh start mindset in Denmark . In addition consumer beliefs are significantly and positively associated with attitudes towards and intentions to buy local foods . Local food marketers can use our findings to target their communications more effectively .
209,This study investigates the important managerial issue of whether the packaging language of the Western consumer packaged food products should be adapted for emerging markets . An experiment using a 2 2 design was conducted instore with real products to enhance the studys external validity . With Pakistan as the contextual emerging market Pakistani shoppers were exposed to the English and adapted packaging of the two products and rated their quality perception packaging likability and attributes associated with the packaging . They also tasted and rated their overall satisfaction with the taste and chose their preferred packaging . Underpinned by standardisation and adaptation literature and symbolic perception theory the findings show that consumers rated and preferred the English packaging more than the adapted packaging . Also while the English packaging was associated with attributes including elegance and trustworthiness the adapted packaging was viewed as more personalised . Furthermore the findings hold across demographic variables of income and English language literacy . These findings run contrary to the prevailing strategy of Western global brands in emerging markets where the usual practice is to localise the packaging of the brands as they enter the markets . The findings provide both theoretical and practical insights into the implications of localisation strategy of Western brands in emerging markets .
210,Initial research indicates that the use of immersive technologies may improve the predictive validity and reliability of liking scores in consumer testing . However how immersive technologies impact Just About Right ratings is hardly known . Forty five participants took part in three tasting sessions each in a different context 1 laboratory 2 immersive context simulating a caf using audiovisual cues and 3 real caf . Each session participants tasted four tomato soups varying in salt content preceded by a warm up sample . Liking optimal levels of sensory attributes and engagement were measured . Results showed that there were no differences in liking or JAR ratings on sensory attributes of the soups across the three contexts . Nevertheless participants felt more engaged in the real caf and simulated caf than in the laboratory . These results contribute to a better understanding of how sensory differences as assessed in a laboratory or immersive context relate to sensory differences that consumers would notice when they use the products in real life .
211,The aim of the study was to identify the importance of individual food product attributes as well as their relation to the purchase behaviour . To achieve this consumer preferences were decomposed in conditions of full access to information and data was compared with actual consumer behaviour related to making purchasing decisions in front of the store shelf . Based on data from 338 respondents conjoint analysis and repeated ANOVA measurements were carried out allowing to eliminate individual behavioural patterns . The results showed a dissonance between the consumers attitudes towards the attributes and their shopping behaviour . The processing method was the most important declared attribute for consumers meanwhile this information was the least searched for during purchase . At the same time shelf life period marked as the least important was the main information searched for by consumers when shopping . The results also show a clear dislike towards the use of microwaves as a preservation method while traditional thermal preservation was marked as the most positive for consumers . In addition consumers were classified into 3 heterogeneous groups identifying differences in the preferences of food attributes . The obtained results have practical value relating not only to the preferences of individual attributes but also to their various variants . The results can be a guide for companies to properly label food products . The indicated dissonance illustrates the educational gap and related insufficient motivation to get to know the product before buying it . This is extremely important in connection with technological development and new food processing methods .
212,Previous eye tracking research has demonstrated that high calorie food cues capture visual attention particularly in individuals with overweight and weight concerns . The present experiment investigated whether this attentional bias can be influenced by context variables and changes over time . This was studied via time course analysis . Ninety women were presented with 60 picture pairs that either showed a combination of high calorie food low calorie food high calorie food non food or low calorie food non food . The women were assigned to one of three groups overweight with weight concerns normal weight with weight concerns normal weight without weight concerns . The relative number of fixations on food cues was examined across the course of the picture pair presentations for one second intervals . High calorie food was fixated more often than low calorie food and non food only during the first second of the picture pair presentation . Subsequently all participants showed the tendency to gaze on low calorie cues when these cues were combined with high calorie cues . This study revealed timing related context effects on visual food cue reactivity . While the early attentional bias to high calorie cues could not be changed by context this was possible during the later processing stage . Future studies need to examine whether the observed context effect can influence food choices and eating behavior .
213,Check All That Apply is a popular method used for collecting word based sensory descriptions from consumers . Free Comment as a response to open ended questions is an interesting alternative because it removes biases due to the use of a predefined list of descriptors . In the context of a home used test FC enables subjects to express themselves more naturally . The present study investigated the relevance of the use of FC at home for word based sensory description of a set of products . Two groups of 60 consumers of red wines characterised four French red wines from different terroirs performing either a CATA task or a FC task . The two sensory tasks were performed at home according to sensory modality visual olfactory and gustatory . The first objective was to investigate whether a FC protocol can be successfully conducted at home and whether it enables the characterisation and discrimination of a set of products . The second objective was to investigate whether extrinsic sensory information affects FC descriptions . The third objective was to investigate whether CATA and FC provide comparable information in the HUT context . The results show that an FC protocol is feasible at home and that the extrinsic sensory information did not affect FC descriptions . FC enabled better characterisation and discrimination of the products than CATA . A new test of product differences based on the total bootstrap procedure was proposed to compare FC and CATA .
214,This study proposes a new model for understanding the behavior of consumers of organic products using the theory of self esteem and the congruence among images containing organic and transgenic attributes . The study employed image visualization metrics based on experiments using the eye tracking instrument . The methodological part was divided into two stages . The first was based on a Discrete Choice model obtaining the following probabilities of the consumer choosing the product 2.52 8.5 4.3 2.43 and 5.2 for an increase in self esteem for the male gender for the presence of an organic seal for the presence of a transgenic seal and for the presence of a seal that represents a large property respectively . The second stage was based on hypothesis tests as a complementary methodology to the first stage . In this context the time metrics total fixation of look on the product and time of first fixation on the product for the organic vs. transgenic seals did not differ for individuals classified as having low self esteem and in individuals of the male gender . As for women and for individuals with high self esteem these metrics were lower in the visualizations of an organic seal compared to the transgenic ones . We conclude that visual attention is influenced by the self esteem and the congruency of the image in food decision . It is suggested that other studies should delve more deeply into applying the model to other behaviors and products .
215,Many people implicitly believe that unhealthy foods are tastier than healthy foods even when they explicitly report that they dont . It is unclear whether this unhealthy tasty intuition is already present in childhood . Children from families with a lower socioeconomic position consume poorer diets than children from families with a higher SEP. Paradoxically populations with a lower SEP are underrepresented in research and least reached by lifestyle interventions . This study explored implicit and explicit associations between healthiness tastiness and liking of foods in primary school aged children and parents with a lower SEP .
216,The aims of the present study are to assess the impact of a pleasure oriented intervention on the nutritional quality of midafternoon snacks chosen by mother child dyads and to evaluate the evolution of the relationship between the liking and perceived healthiness of the food items offered for the snack choices . Data were collected at two laboratory sessions during which children and mothers were separately asked to choose two food items for a midafternoon snack first for themselves and then for the other dyad member . Participants also rated their liking and perceived healthiness of the 10 food items . After T1 dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental group with an in home pleasure oriented intervention to stimulate the pleasure of consuming healthy foods or to a control group . Our study shows the lack of a significant effect of the intervention on the nutritional quality of snacks chosen at T2 . However for the children in the experimental group the relationship between liking and perceived healthiness which was not significant at T1
217,Front of Pack nutrition labels are emerging as a prominent public policy tool for promoting healthy eating . In this study we question how different FoP nutrition labels ranging from more directive to semi directive and non directive affect perceived visual attention and nutritional quality perception . The visual attention was measured by eye tracing measures and nutritional quality by healthiness perception and recommended frequency of consumption . Seventy six participants were randomly assigned in one of three experimental conditions where they were asked to give estimates on eight different chocolate snack bars . To test whether participants estimates were accurate we surveyed fifty six nutritionists and asked for their assessments of the same group of products . The results showed that Nutriscore required least visual attention in terms of dwell time number of fixations and average fixation duration followed by MTL and GDA . Participants in NS and MTL condition gave significantly higher estimates of nutritional quality compared to experts estimates . Most accurate estimates came from products with GDA label . Color coded fields required less visual attention compared to GDA without adding to visual efficiency . More directive FoP nutrition labels require less visual attention but lead to inflated estimates of products nutrition quality in the category of less healthy products . In creating public policies removing the possibility for consumers to process nutritional information and absolute estimates of products nutrition quality should not be disregarded .
218,This paper reports the estimation of an Actor Partner Interdependence Model examining how meal preparation focus measured by taste context and thriftaffect actors and partners satisfaction with food related life in cohabiting couples . Questionnaires were administered to 187 different sex couples in Denmark . Both members of the couple reported their degree of agreement with a set of statements regarding meal production focus and the SWFRL scale . Using the APIM and structural equation modeling we found that the womans SWFRL was positively associated with her own focus on taste in meal production as wells as by her partners focus on taste . Womens SWFRL was also positively associated with their own focus on physical context in meal production and negatively by their partners focus on physical context . The mans SWFRL only was positively associated with his own focus on physical context and by his partners focus on thrift in meal production . These results suggest that meal preparation focus relationships between members of a couple through by both actor and partner effects can effectively contribute to increase both their satisfaction with food related life and their well being .
219,The liking of food in the presence of background noise has been associated with the noise type and level . So far however there have been few studies investigating the non acoustic factors associated with food perception in the presence of background noise . This study investigated the food liking due to three non acoustic factors in the presence of background noise relative to the ambient background noise . Fifteen participants rated the liking of food via questionnaires . The perceptual relative food liking due to age gender and noise sensitivity at different noise types and levels were presented . The results indicated that age noise sensitivity and gender influence relative food liking . Females had lower liking ratings of food than males
220,Nowadays there is a growing interest to add value to food industry by products and incorporate them as new ingredients for novel food products . However there is very little knowledge about consumers reactions towards novel food products made with upcycled ingredients . This manuscript provides the first critical scientific investigation of UK consumers preferences for novel food products made with upcycled ingredients using four attributes price flour protein and Carbon Trust label . Using a hypothetical ranking experiment involving biscuits results showed that consumers prefer biscuits made with conventional flour and tend to reject biscuits made with upcycled sunflower flour . Results suggest there is heterogeneity in consumers valuation with three groups identified the first group with price sensitive consumers and the strongest preferences for low price biscuits the second group with traditionalist consumers and strongest rejection for upcycled sunflower flour the third group with environmentalist consumers and the strongest preference for biscuits with the Carbon Trust label . Most consumers had not heard of upcycled ingredients before but they would consider buying foods with upcycled ingredients . These findings provide insights into the psychology of consumers preferences which can be used to most effectively communicate the benefits of upcycled ingredients to the public . This will also have important implications for future labelling strategies for policy makers providing valuable insights to upcycled food products manufacturers .
221,Discrete choice experiments have become an important tool for assessing the preferences of consumers for finfish seafood products . This investigation presents a systematic literature review of studies performed in the last 20years that use DCEs to analyse consumers preferences for finfish products with the purpose to identify the main insights of consumer behaviour towards these products the most used attributes for this type of experiments and to discuss and compare some willingness to pay estimations . We found that origin was the most used attribute for this kind of experiments while other important factors were the harvest method a specific certification label and the species or products considered . The WTP estimates evidenced that consumers are willing to pay premiums for domestic products while similarly wild products were preferred over farmed products . Also there were higher WTP estimates for certified products in which specific certification labels were better options rather than just claiming that the product was certified or not . All claims and labels related to sustainability nutritional health and safety information provided premiums that consumers were willing to pay however the importance differed depending on the type of label or claim the country and species . Future research should consider the influence of being or not the main purchaser in the household as it might affect the WTP values . Also given the importance future research extensions using DCEs are needed on the Chinese and Asian finfish market .
222,Emojis were suggested for children to be used to measure food elicited emotions . The present study was aimed to explore the appropriateness of emojis to describe pre adolescents emotions elicited by foods recalled in relation to different evoked eating contexts and to explore related age and gender differences . Fifty five boys and forty one girls aged 913 participated to the study . First subjects were asked to recall by means of an open ended question the foods they had in specific eating contexts Most liked food and Most disliked food Breakfast Dinner Snack Birthday and Novel food . Then they were asked to select the emojis appropriate to describe their feelings for the context related foods by selecting from a list of 92 facial emojis . Emojis selected by more than 20 of children in at least one eating context qualified as food related . In total 46 emojis resulted as appropriate to describe emotions in different eating contexts . Pre adolescents used mainly positive emojis except for the context Most disliked food where mainly negative emojis were used . Most food related emojis resulted from Most liked food and Most disliked food but the context Birthday also added some context specific emojis . The number of selected emojis varied across evoked eating contexts eliciting different foods . Age and gender significantly affected emoji selection across and within foods elicited by varied eating contexts with girls and 911 year old subjects selecting some emojis more frequently across all contexts but also within contexts . The approach used in the present study has the potential to be used for the development of a food related emotion measurement tool for pre adolescents . Future research aimed at interpreting the meaning of facial emojis is needed and should consider age and gender differences .
223,Food liking is one of the main determinants of food intake . Salt taste perception and preference that play a role in liking of salt may be genetically determined although research in humans is scarce . The aim of this study was to explore the associations between genetics salt taste perception preference self reported salt habit and intake . The participants were young and healthy adults . Salt taste thresholds were determined with British Standard ISO3972 2011 methodology and salt taste preference by ratings of saltiness and pleasantness of tomato soup with salt concentrations reflecting salt content in foods . Self reported salt habit was determined by asking participants how salty they usually eat their food and salt intake with two 24 hour 5 step multiple pass recalls . Genotyping for variants in the
224,Little research has been published on emotional responses evoked by completely new innovative food products . The objectives of the present study were 1 to assess the emotional response to new products in two different scenarios looking at the smoothie pouch or tasting the smoothie with the smoothie pouch alongside 2 to compare the information obtained when the participants use photographs or use words to express emotions . In the Pack alone scenario similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words . In the Pack and tasting scenario the richness of the emotional response increased when using images . In both scenarios the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words . This could be considered an advantage as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed . The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores .
225,As tasting is a dynamic process temporal data are collected simultaneously with tasting . Indeed most newly reported studies involving consumers have been conducted using the Temporal Dominance of Sensations or Temporal Check That Apply methods . Concurrent data collection reduces potential bias such as memory but it attaches great importance to the moment at which the sensations are cited . Thus it results in measurement of durations possibly made imprecise due to heterogeneity in consumers behaviour which could affect conclusions . A new retrospective method inspired from Temporal Order of Sensations Pick 3 and Rank and the 3 phases of wine evaluation is introduced in this article . Based on a concept close to dominance the Attack Evolution Finish method allows consumers to select one descriptor each at the beginning at the middle and at the end of the tasting . The results obtained with two different panels carrying out both the AEF and TDS tasks on dark chocolates are compared . The conclusions are very similar in terms of product discrimination . The retrospective task removes the consumers heterogeneity in terms of the number of citations delays and durations and thus requires no data transformation before analyses . In view of these results rather than promoting a new method the article raises questions about the level of detail to look at in temporal sensory data .
226,Berlynes theory of hedonic appreciation in experimental esthetics includes complexity as a relevant dimension in the development of preferences . However the soundness of this theory in the field of food and beverages has been challenged . The work reported here investigates the influence of perceived complexity on consumers preferences for some dairy desserts . Given the limits on sensory complexity reported in the literature we controlled for consumers level of familiarity with the products used enough products to be able to test a quadratic model evaluated sensory complexity with consumers and analyzed data after clustering . Seven gourmet dairy desserts were tested by 145 French consumers unfamiliar with this type of product in a quantitative study . Products were also sensory characterized by a panel using an adaptation of Sequential Profiling . We distinguished four groups of consumers with different perceptions of sensory complexity . For one group the influence of complexity on preference was in line with Berlynes theory . Individual differences were also underlined between groups as the self reported eating style and the level of familiarity with dairy products . Finally our results confirm the importance of a dynamic evaluation to understand sensory complexity . Indeed our findings show the influence of the number of sensations and their temporal evolution on sensory complexity . For the first time we underline the potential effect of texture and flavor sensations on perceived complexity .
227,Innovations are an important part of the further advancement of societies in general as well as of companies in particular . Individuals can benefit from the advantages of innovations while companies can maintain or increase their market share and profitability . However especially in the food sector scientific or technological innovations often encounter mistrust and rejecting reactions from consumers resulting in decreasing acceptance of those innovations . Therefore this paper aims to gain a deeper comprehension of consumer acceptance of innovative food products as well as to identify antecedent factors of innovation related perception . For the empirical investigation of our conceptualized model an online survey was conducted in Germany and the collected data were analyzed through structural equation modeling . The results confirmed a high predictive power of the multi dimensional model of consumer acceptance . Our first major finding indicates that relative advantage naturalness novelty and discomfort are the most important driving factors of the innovation related perception of food products . Further important findings show that innovation related perception has a strong positive and highly significant impact on customer perceived value respectively a strong negative and highly significant impact on the customer perceived risk . In summary innovation related perception customer perceived value as well as customer perceived risk are all important variables related to the acceptance of an innovative food product . The food sector can benefit from the insights provided by this study to communicate and market their products accordingly to the results to reduce mistrust and increase acceptance of food innovations on the consumer side .
228,We are surrounded by sensory food cues such as odors that may trigger conscious decisions and even lead to eating it is therefore crucial to better understand the effect of food odors on behavioral responses . Food odor exposure has been shown to enhance appetite for food products with similar properties sensory specific appetite . This suggests that based on previous encounters with foods we have learned to detect the nutritional content of foods through our sense of smell . We investigated the influence of aware exposure of macronutrient related odors on various measures of eating behavior in a cross over intervention study . Thirty two normal weight healthy and unrestrained Dutch females took part in five test sessions . On each test session they were exposed to one of five conditions and assessed on specific appetite food preferences and intake . Odor exposure increased congruent appetite after protein related odor exposure . Similarly protein related odor exposure influenced the liking for protein foods and the preference ranking for savory products . However food intake was not affected by smelling congruent food odors . Together this indicates that exposure to food odors may mostly influence appetite but does not impact subsequent food intake . Moreover appetite seems to be triggered by taste qualities rather than macronutrient information of the food as signaled by olfactory cues . Future studies should investigate the role of awareness in more detail to fully understand how odors might be used to steer people towards healthier food choices .
229,Organically certified wild plant foods are rarely addressed in scientific or public discourses on organic food even though 30 of the worlds organically certified land is dedicated to wild plant gathering . This oversight may leave organic consumers unaware of the market relevance of wild plant foods . The aim of this study was therefore to understand organic consumers attitudes knowledge and purchasing and gathering practices with respect to wild plant foods and how sociodemographic variables and attitudes can predict knowledge and practices . A purposive sample was drawn from 22 urban and rural food markets across Austria and 497 organic consumers were interviewed using successive freelists and four point Likert scale questions on attitudes . Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regressions . Organic consumers knew a median of nine wild food plants and reported five as being gathered and one as being purchased . They valued food quality and the responsible harvest of wild food plants but assigned them a low economic relevance with some respondents sceptical about their suitability as food . Rural residence a higher share of organic consumption and a greater emphasis on responsible harvesting predicted knowledge and gathering of a larger number of plant species . These results confirm that organic consumers know gather and have positive attitudes with respect to wild plant foods although they are hardly aware about their market relevance . We argue that consumers need to be better informed about the wild origin of food ingredients and the added value of organic certification of wild plant foods .
230,The increasing intake of energy dense snacks among children is one of the contributing factors to childhood overweight . To understand childrens snacking habits snack choices of parents are essential to take into account . General parenting is one of the important factors that can influence the development of healthy eating patterns and weight status among children . Therefore this study aims to explore how the key constructs of general parenting relate to mothers snack choice for their children aged 27years . The Dutch version of the validated Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire was used to assess the key constructs of general parenting . An extensive 13 day diary study with 136 Dutch mothers was used to measure the snacks mothers provided their children aged 24years and 57years . For both groups of mothers in our sample differences were found on the scores of coercive control and overprotection . No differences between the mothers were present on the key constructs behavioral control nurturance and structure . Results give a first indication that more mothers who scored relatively higher on coercive control provided unhealthy products like candy and cookies and fewer mothers provided vegetables compared to mothers who scored lower on coercive control . A higher score on coercive control combined with a higher score on overprotection was associated with fewer mothers providing unhealthy products like cookies and candies .
231,Sound can have a profound impact on our eating experience and behavior . The term sonic seasoning arising from crossmodal correspondences denotes the tendency for soundtracks with congruent taste flavor attributes to alter peoples food perception . However the implicit behavior effects of such sound taste correspondence have not yet been tested . Employing eye tracking technology the current study explored the influence of custom composed taste congruent soundtracks on visual attention to food and how this audio visual relationship differs across cultures . Seventy two participants were each exposed to three sound conditions while observing different food items in a choice paradigm . Across both cultures participants spent more time fixating on sweet food while listening to sweet music and salty food when listening to salty music while no differences were observed in the no music condition . Danish participants had regardless of sound condition longer fixation times on the food images compared to their Chinese counterparts . Participants choices in each sound condition were consistent with fixation time spent implying a clear congruency effect between music and choice behavior . Our findings provide evidence of how specifically tailored music can guide consumers visual attention to specific food items suggesting that the brain indeed integrates multiple streams of sensory information during decision making . The cross cultural aspect of our study can ultimately be valuable for understanding auditory nudging in different market segments .

233,The present research included two field studies investigating firstly the effects of round and angular typefaces on taste expectations and secondly how such expectations may have downstream effects on naturalistic consumer choice . A taste experiment conducted at a science festival asked participants
234,This study describes differences in considerations and value conflicts between mothers living in the North and the South of Italy during snack provision to their 27years old children . Semi structured interviews with 20 mothers living in the North and 20 mothers living in the South of Italy were conducted . Participants matched on educational level and weight status . Mothers considerations in snack provision were grouped into four key themes health related child related time related and product related . North Italian mothers showed more health related considerations while providing a snack compared to mothers living in the South . In case mothers from the South mentioned healthiness as a consideration it was often related to giving energy . The child related key theme revealed that a snack needs to be liked by the child otherwise Italian mothers do not provide it . For the time related key theme differences were small between North and South Italian mothers . The product related key theme showed the brand to be more important for South Italian mothers . Mothers from the North of Italy experienced more value conflicts all related to health . The current studied showed that even within the same country geographical differences in mothers considerations and value conflicts for providing snacks exist . This implies that snack choice considerations and values seem to be influenced by tradition and family culture .
235,The use of immersive technologies allows for the addition of contextually relevant information into the otherwise sterile laboratory experience . The addition of context has been hypothesized to yield improved sample discriminability in part due to enhanced involvement or engagement of the panelist . A questionnaire was recently developed to characterize consumer engagement during sensory and consumer testing . The main factors contributing to engagement were active involvement purposeful intent and affective value . The objective of this study was to further validate the temporal reliability of the engagement questionnaire and evaluate how subject engagement changes when assessing red wines in a traditional immersive and actual environment . After evaluating the wines in each environment participants rated their level of agreement on a 10 item questionnaire that measured overall levels of engagement with a task . Participants were less actively involved in the wine evaluation F
236,We examine the effectiveness of specific nudges in the choice environment to foster healthy choice and consumption among consumers with fast vs. slow life history strategies short term impulsive reward sensitive vs. long term reflective controlled fociassociated with low and high socio economic status respectively . The results of two experiments conducted in a field and an online setting show that consumers with a fast rather than slow life history strategy are more susceptible to scarcity cues boosting choice and actual consumption of healthy foods when these cues are associated with the healthy option . Conversely for slow LHS consumers the evidence suggests that scarcity cues are less influential and instead abundance cues tend to foster healthy choice . Finally in line with the LHS logic acute food craving mediates the impact of scarcity vs. abundance cues for fast but not slow strategists while perceptions of socially validated trust in the food source fulfill this role for slow but not fast strategists .
237,Nutritional claims and health claims on food products have been introduced as interpretative aids to simplify the information provided on food labelling . However HCs have been criticised for being unappealing and an information overload on food packages . We aimed to explore whether adding a HC to the associated NC is a good strategy or information overload in a close to real non hypothetical choice experiment with real products and real payments . Consumers valuation of two NCs and HCs in breakfast biscuits is measured in two treatments . Treatment A communicates NCs and tests for the external ecological validity of the experiment while treatment B communicates both the NC and the associated HC . Results from the willingness to pay estimates showed that consumers are willing to pay premiums for the fat related HC in addition to the NC while not for the claims related to the fibre content .
238,We conducted a virtual reality study to examine the color that first came to a persons mind when he or she was drinking tea . The participants were asked to drink Chinese green or red tea without any visual cues and then to show the first color in their mind on a circle or a cup of tea in VR . The results revealed that they were able to detect the difference in the bitterness and astringency of the two types of tea . Despite variations in the specific colors chosen by different individuals their color responses for Chinese green tea were more greenish than those for Chinese red tea thus indicative of some associations between the greenred component of color and the bitterness and astringency . Moreover the results also revealed that the color responses made on the virtual tea were more similar to the actual color of tea beverages than those made on the virtual circle suggesting that the participants may rely on a concrete object to exemplify a given flavor they experienced without visual cues . These results provide novel findings about color flavor associations for complicated and subtle flavors and shed some light on how to modulate the participants color flavor associations via modifying the food or drink that they bring up to their mind to exemplify a certain flavor .
239,Measuring food evoked emotions dynamically during consumption can be done using explicit self report methods such as Temporal Dominance of Emotions and implicit methods such as recording facial expressions . It is not known whether or how dynamic explicit and implicit emotion measures correspond . This study investigated how explicit self reported food evoked emotions evaluated with TDE are related to implicit food evoked emotions determined from facial expressions . Fifty six participants evaluated six yogurts with granola pieces varying in size hardness and concentration using multiple bite assessment employing TDE for the first third and fifth bite of consumption . Consumers were video recorded during each bite of consumption and facial expressions were analysed using FaceReader .
240,The perception that a food is healthy or low fat has been proposed as an important issue influencing eating behaviour . This study had two aims a to test the perceived health value of two popular foods in Brazil and b to investigate the impact of consuming these foods on subsequent food reward . Individual differences in adiposity and eating behaviour traits were also explored . Twenty four adults were included mean Body Mass Index 27.64.1kg m2 and mean weight 77.414.8kg . They attended the laboratory on two different occasions for Perceived high Fat and perceived Low Fat conditions . Food reward was tested by the LFPQ BR in fasted and fed states for each condition . Two popular food in Brazil were chosen to be used as test meals and were prepared in order to be similar in terms of weight calorie content and macronutrient composition it was hypothesised that Coxinha would be perceived as less healthy and higher fat content than a chicken sandwich . A paper based visual analogue scale was used to confirm this hypothesis . Anthropometric measures and eating behaviour traits scores were undertaken . Results showed that the two nutritionally matched foods differed on several indicators of perceived healthiness including perceived fat content . Post consumption there was an increased implicit wanting for high fat sweet food after the PLF meal . Exploratory analyses showed that cognitive restraint was an independent predictor for the perception of the fat content of PHF and moderated the impact of PHF on implicit wanting . These findings have implications for food marketing and the role of restrained eating on food perception and food reward .
241,Alcoholic cocktails are consumed in very different situations and then consumers may differ in their favorite context to drink a cocktail . Diversity in the preferred context of cocktail consumption may reflect individual differences in taste responsiveness and personality traits as well as cocktail liking . This study aims at 1 extending the efficacy of a coupled semiotic and statistical methodology for text analysis in uncovering aspects of preferred contexts of cocktail consumption 2 testing if specific preferred contexts of cocktail consumption are related to individual differences 3 investigating the relationships between preferred context to have cocktails and patterns of liking for cocktails . 159 cocktails consumers were characterized by personality traits cocktail involvement alcoholic beverages intake and PROP taster status and were asked to describe their preferred context to consume an alcoholic cocktail . Consumers were then asked to taste in blind conditions and rate their liking of six alcoholic aperitif cocktails . Three thematic clusters were identified
242,The common practice of particle addition into semisolid foods is known to influence sensory textural properties but the resulting influence on consumer acceptability is not well understood . A systematic trial was therefore designed involving a set of nine yoghurt samples to investigate the effect of particle addition on consumer acceptability . Agar microgels were fabricated and added to yoghurt at varying levels of modulus particle size and particle concentration . The yoghurt samples were presented to consumers who rated acceptability and subsequently selected from the attributes
243,The most common tools to understand perception of food products are hall tests surveys and observations . However these approaches require large samples to get reliable results and they are rather costly and time consuming . Furthermore they are also highly expert dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly . In our paper we suggest an electroencephalography based approach to evaluate perceived product similarity in a cross modal taste visual task . We tested two potential neurometrics measured from Fz electrode the amplitude of the N400 like evoked response potentials and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400600ms period after visual stimulus presentation . Both metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarity scores at both individual and group levels however N400 like amplitude had greater inter subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications . The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations could be compared to traditional hall tests and may potentially reveal subtle differences in food perception that can not be captured in the hall tests .
244,Although ensuring food safety is still an urgent social issue in China ethical consumption practices are relatively new and ethical food is not widely consumed . Chinese consumers often face confusing information about a particular food product s safety and are concerned about the situation . Drawing upon stress coping theory this study examines whether consumer confusion and negative emotions drive intentions to adopt ethical food . Data collected from a sample of 505 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling . The results show that consumer confusion has a significant impact on negative emotions which in turn influence intentions to purchase ethical food products . This research advances the food preference literature by providing a new perspective on ethical consumption based on coping strategies . The findings are important for policymakers and business leaders seeking to develop and better promote safer and more ethical food programs in China .
245,Insect based foods have gained much attention as an alternative source of protein in recent years because of their high nutritional content and low production costs . However consumer acceptance of insect based foods still poses a big challenge in many societies . Across three studies we examined how social companions and location are associated with peoples willingness to eat insect based foods . We also examined the positive arousing and positive calming emotions that were evoked by several eating contexts . The results of Studies 1 and 2 revealed that participants expected that they would be more willing to eat insect based foods with friends and in pubs and at food festivals . The results of Study 3 replicated the main findings of the first two studies using the actual names of insect based food products namely mealworm burger and cricket chocolate bar . Moreover these contexts where people would be more willing to eat insect based foods were associated with positive arousing emotions rather than positive calming emotions . Taken together then these findings reveal the role of contexts associated with positive arousing emotions in eating insect based foods and provide practical advice concerning the situations in which the consumers acceptance of insect based foods may be increased .
246,This study explores the role of food brand logo orientation on consumers perceptions and attitudes regarding food products through four studies . Study 1 examines the effects of food brand logo orientation on consumer perceptions of food tastiness and risk . The findings suggest that diagonal food brand logos result in higher taste and risk perception in branded food . Study 2 reveals the underlying mechanisms of this effect by introducing perceived movement as a mediator between logo orientation and food perception . The results support the inference that movement is an underlying mechanism for the effect . Study 3 examines the effects of brand logo orientation and regulatory focus on consumer attitudes regarding branded food . The results suggest that for consumers with a promotion focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a more favorable attitude toward the food . For consumers with a prevention focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a less favorable attitude toward the food . Study 4 establishes validity of the above findings regarding native English speakers .
247,CATA questions are popular for sensory product characterisation tasks with consumers . Lingering uncertainty over the meaning of term citation frequency was addressed in the present research which directly compared CATA questions with intensity and applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . In three studies evidence fitting with expectations based on the extant literature was obtained to confirm that citation frequency reflects intensity . The two response types were strongly linearly related meaning that it is possible to infer significant differences between samples for a given CATA term as representing differences in perceived intensity . This finding emphasises how despite the simplicity of the CATA task and the fact that individual responses are not measures of intensity the average citation frequencies do reflect perceived intensity . Therefore across a group of consumers there is no information loss relative to rating scales . A systematic difference between citation frequencies and intensity ratings was attenuation of scale use in the latter which was between 15 and 80 on a 0 to 100 scale . Attenuation was less pronounced in CATA responses which spanned approx . 5 to 85 . In the second part of the research which included six studies CATA questions were compared with applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . The results were highly similar to the comparison between CATA questions and intensity scales and further confirmed that average CATA term citation frequency can be interpreted as representing consumers intensity perceptions . The attenuation in scale range was again observed . Collectively the results contribute further support for the popularity of CATA questions for sensory characterization by consumers in product testing .
248,Excessive salt in the diet can pose significant health risks and therefore the reduction of salt derived from food is an important issue relating to human nutrition and health . Furthermore the perception of saltiness will be different among people when considering their innate sensitivity gender age psychological traits and dietary habits . In this study 31 younger participants and 29 older participants were used as research subjects . A web based questionnaire survey was used to collect information regarding of socio demographics consumption frequency and liking for salty and pungent food as well as personality traits throughout the younger and the older participants . In addition the 6 n propylthiouracil ratings were tested by the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale in the laboratory conditions . The rated difference from control method was used to test the sensitivity differences in the saltiness of NaCl and the pungent sensation elicited by Sichuan pepper oleoresin between the younger and older groups . The results showed that the thresholds were significantly lower in the younger group than in the older group except for the detection threshold of saltiness . Furthermore the recognition threshold of saltiness decreased in the presence of the sub threshold pungency solution while the salty intensity was enhanced in both the younger and older groups when exposed to the slightly pungent solution compared to the control . For the younger group the enhancement percentage of the salty intensity was between 9.3 and 12.5 while at the concentration of 4.05g L the salty enhancement percentage increased by 6.4 in the older group . In addition the reduction percentageof NaCl reached a level of up to 34.4 in the younger group and was 4.4 in the older group . The Partial Least Squares Regression results indicated that the percentage change in salty intensity increased when the detection threshold of saltiness the sensation seeking ratings and PROP ratings increased . On the contrary the change decreased when the age life satisfaction ratings detection threshold of pungency and consumption frequency of salty food increased . These findings not only provide new information for the flavor design of salt reduced food and dishes but also be valuable to public health as well as economic benefits .
249,The Dietarian Identity Questionnaire assesses how an individual thinks feels and behaves regarding the consumption or eschewal of animal products . This instrument offers a useful method for understanding how omnivores vegetarians and vegans alike construct their eating behaviours . In the current study
250,This paper investigates the relationship between the choice drivers for wine among Chinese consumers with their personal values using two sets of Best Worst Scaling data .
251,Application of tribology in food systems has primarily focused on liquids and semi solids . The present study examined texture perception in a solid food using apples as the proof of concept . The study aimed to assess a the ability of tribological measurements to predict a multicomponent sensory property in hard food and b the impact of two common motion patterns on tribological measurements and mathematical correlations with sensory texture of a hard food . The textures of ten apple varieties were evaluated by a trained sensory panel while friction and wear behavior were measured instrumentally . Spearman correlations indicated that texture attributes significantly correlated with total penetration depth and with friction coefficients during the transient phase but not with friction coefficients from the steady state phase in both rotational and linear tribology . This was an important finding as the steady state phase is predominantly used in food tribology research yet our findings showed poor correlations with steady state data while showing strong correlations with sensory perception in the transient phase . The strong mathematical correlations found in the transient phase suggest that test conditions that provoke a dynamic friction response from the sample may more closely resemble the conditions under which humans perceive friction during oral processing .
252,The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of the inclusion of nutritional warnings on consumer associations with labels of ultra processed products . The study was conducted in Uruguay at two points in time before and after the compulsory implementation of nutritional warnings . A total of 163 participants evaluated three labels of ultra processed products using a word association task . In the first evaluation performed 9months before the entry into force of nutritional warnings labels were presented without warnings . Nine months later participants evaluated the labels with warnings again . Data were analyzed using content analysis . At T1 when labels were presented without nutritional warnings responses to the word association task were related to a description of the product category expected sensory characteristics of the products brand names liking and eating occasions . However when the labels were presented with the warnings at T2 a significant increase in the frequency of mention of responses was observed within the categories
253,While drinkability is of paramount importance when discussing beer there is no established methodology to assess it . The main objective of the present study was to develop a new method of sensory evaluation with consumers to obtain a better understanding of beer drinkability . With the aim of being practically and effectively used in a wide range of consumer tests in an
254,Gathering information from social networks such as Twitter has emerged to obtain spontaneous and direct opinions of users about a topic . This study focuses on using co occurrence networks to analyse Twitter information . The objectives were to study the impact of text pre treatment and to apply co occurrence networks for analysing what is said on Twitter about specific topics like gluten free . As such 16 386 tweets in Spanish containing terms sin gluten and gluten free were collected . A subset of 3000 tweets was used to make co occurrence networks two ways i from the manually coded text and ii from pre cleaned text . Results indicate that the co occurrence network from pre cleaned text provides meaningful information showing structure and relevance for terms like the network from coded text . The whole set of tweets was used to explore Twitter information on gluten free showing users share information about products occasions social situations and places but also product characteristics sensations and diet or health issues related to the products . Five product categories critical for the lack of gluten occupied most tweets and according to the related terms were intended to recommend how to get these gluten free products and to exhibit what they prepare and eat . These aspects were different among products and separated co occurrence networks allowed better identification .
255,Bitterness is classically considered undesirable in foods and beverages . Yet widespread commercial success of beers indicate bitterness is desirable for some consumers . Here we tested whether personality traits influence beer liking and intake . Under laboratory conditions beer consumers rated liking and intensity of 2 pale ales and a lager and intensity of two bitter solutions . Participants also completed intake and personality questionnaires . A liking ratio for each beer was calculated from each participants liking for that specific beer and their total liking for all beers . Participants were classified as weekly monthly or yearly pale ale consumers using intake data . Using intensity ratings personality measures and other parameters hierarchical linear regression was used to predict liking ratios and logistic regression was used to predict beer intake frequency . A significant interaction between Sensation Seeking and quinine bitterness was found for the liking ratio of a pale ale . The interaction revealed liking of the pale ale increased with Sensation Seeking but only if quinine bitterness was also high . Intake models showed increased odds of frequent pale ale intake with greater quinine bitterness and lower liking for lager beer . These data suggest liking and intake of pale ales is positively related to Sensation Seeking and bitter taste perception . Contrary to findings in other bitter foods and beverages the high bitterness found in pale ales may be desirable for some consumers .
256,Electronic cigarettes are a recent development in tobacco harm reduction . They are marketed as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes but their health impact is unknown . Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the odor perception of smokers and vapers in comparison to non smokers . For the study 181 study participants aged 18 to 46years were selected and divided into three groups including the control group as well as two investigated groups consisted of smokers and vapers . The individuals were evaluated by applying the Sniffin Sticks odor threshold discrimination and identification test . To express the overall results a composite threshold discrimination identification score was calculated . The results of the threshold test showed a significant difference between non smokers and smokers as well as smokers and vapers . The data of odor discrimination and odor identification as well as the TDI score revealed a significant difference between all three evaluated groups . Furthermore according to the Pearson test there was a significant correlation between the pack years and odor threshold and the TDI score . However the correlation between the pack years and the results of the odor discrimination and identification was not statistically significant . Besides the duration of vaping and amount of consumed liquid did not correlate with the odor threshold discrimination identification as well as the TDI score . Finally it can be stated that the non smoker group exhibited the best performance in the conducted olfactory tests closely followed by the vapers . In contrast the consumption of cigarettes had a negative impact on the olfactory perception of smokers .
257,Targeted interventions have important under explored potential for reducing meat consumption . We hypothesized that group specific interventions targeting reduction for reducer moderate hindrance and strong hindrance meat eaters would be effective . All participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions designed for these three meat eating groups or to a control condition . Following the intervention up to 28days of food diaries were gathered to measure their consumption of animal products which were weighted according to their greenhouse gas emissions . The targeted interventions significantly outperformed the non targeted interventions . That is participants in the group matched conditions reduced their animal product consumption by 40g of CO
258,The use of virtual reality in sensory science studies can offer new possibilities for experimental design . For instance VR allows for the modification of visual product properties without changing the product composition . In a set of two augmented virtuality studies we investigated whether the results we obtained in real life settings were comparable to the results we obtained in a VR environment . In Study 1 we transferred an existing sensory science experiment to a VR setting . We invited 100 participants to taste two juices and a piece of cake . In the VR environment participants saw the product either in its original colour or in a modified product atypical colour . After the product tasting we asked them to identify the most dominant flavour . Participants had more difficulties identifying the flavour when the product was shown in a modified colour than when it was shown in its original colour . In Study 2 we added an RL control condition to facilitate a direct comparison between the two conditions and to verify our findings from Study 1 . A chi square test for association revealed no significant differences between the RL and VR conditions . We conclude that sensory studies can be successfully transferred to VR and obtain a generally similar pattern of results .
259,Food waste is a significant problem and consumers tendency to reject misshapen produce has been identified as a key contributing factor . The current work investigates the implications of consumers incorporating aesthetic beauty into their prototypesmental renderingsof fruits and vegetables . It is proposed that consumers have idealized prototypes for produce and this impacts the aversion to misshapen produce . The authors draw on prototype theory to predict that consumers personal experiences will influence the extent to which their prototypes for these foods have been biased towards aesthetic beauty and consequently how they respond to produce that is misshapen . Across three studies the authors demonstrate that consumers who have direct experience with produce cultivation view produce that is low in aesthetic beauty as more prototypical less disgusting and more desirable . This work contributes to the food waste literature by offering novel insights into the psychological basis of the aversion to misshapen produce . These findings also present important implications for food policy .
260,This study analyzed childrens 5 to 12years old and their mothers vegetable liking in three countries . Liking measures were collected using tasting sessions in which fourteen different vegetables were tasted . Three factors were tested country status and products . The results showed that mothers gave higher liking vegetable scores than their children when all the participants were analyzed together
261,3D printing has the potential to produce on demand food tailored to individuals needs and preferences . The present study explored 3D printed food acceptance in a real life military setting . Over a period of 4weeks soldiers consumed and evaluated multiple recovery snack bars . In week 1 participants received a benchmark bar that was created with conventional manufacturing processes . In week 2 to 4 participants received a 3D printed snack bar with increasing customisation options choice of texture in week 2 choice of texture and taste in week 3 and choice of texture taste and ingredients in week 4 . Attitudes towards 3D food printing and potential drivers of 3D printed food acceptance were assessed in weeks 1 and 4 before and after repeated consumption of the snack bars .
262,Sensory scientists have adapted several sensory methods to fit childrens cognitive abilities according to their different developmental stages . Although children have been reported to be able to use sensory methods to describe foods and beverages published applications are limited to static characterizations . In this context the objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of using two dynamic methods for sensory characterization with children . A video featuring colored circles was used to convey the idea of temporal perception and to familiarize children with the methods . A series of six vanilla milk desserts was used in the tasting session . A total of 102 children recruited from two Uruguayan schools participated in the study . They were randomly divided in two groups each of which used one of the methods . Results showed that TCATA and TDS allowed capturing the dynamics in the video . However TCATA provided a more detailed description of how the colored circles evolved with time than TDS . In the case of the milk desserts samples both methodologies showed similar results regarding the most relevant sensory characteristics . However children mostly used them as static methods . In the TDS task children dithered for long before selecting a new attribute which points towards difficulties in evaluating dominance . Results from the present work suggest that refinements are needed to make TCATA and TDS methods applicable with children for characterizing food stimuli .
263,In several situations it is desired to simultaneously alter the intensities of two food stimuli without affecting acceptance or causing sensory rejection . However at present it is only possible to determine sensory thresholds by varying just one stimulus at a time . The objective of this study was to propose a new methodology the Hedonic Thresholds Methodology Varying Two Stimuli HTM
264,Consumers increasingly fulfil the role of co creators by collaborating with producers in new product development . Communicating that the product has been co developed with consumers tends to positively influence consumer perceptions . However research remains limited regarding
265,This study aimed to determine how sample temperatures affect sensory attributes of and emotional responses to tomato soup samples . Six professionally trained panelists evaluated two tomato soup products randomly served at four temperatures 25 40 55 and 70C and rated intensities of 29 attributes . Trained panelists found that five attributes changed with sample temperature of tomato soup . A total of 103 consumers also evaluated the same tomato soup products served at four temperatures using check all that apply ballots related to sensory attributes and emotional responses . The 27 emotional and 20 sensory attributes differed significantly among samples of two product types served at four temperatures . A principal component analysis showed that variation in sensory attributes could better be explained by product type rather than sample temperature while emotional response variation was attributed more to sample temperature than to product type . Sensory and emotional drivers of liking were also found to differ with sample temperature . Another study in which 66 consumers characterized sensory and emotional attributes of purified water at the four temperatures was conducted . Consumer emotional responses to water samples changed with sample temperature while sensory perception varied only minimally . In conclusion our findings provide empirical evidence that sample temperature significantly influences both emotional responses and sensory attributes and temperature effects vary with the type of food .
266,The consumption of infusions is affected by many factors namely those associated with culture health and sensory properties . The main goal of this research was to explore and understand consumers perceptions and behaviours regarding consumption and preparation of herbal infusions applying a mixed methodology the evaluation of consumers behaviours assessed through direct self reported measures and indirect methods such as free word association and auto videography . A total of 489 Portuguese consumers replied to a web based questionnaire . Based on their frequency of consumption and availability 60 participants were selected for an observational study . Over 27 of the participants had at least a daily cup of herbal infusion and over 74 had it at least every week . At home participants reported the use of teapots or mugs cups to prepare their infusions and mostly chose bags . Approximately 80 of the respondents removed the bags or loose leaves after steeping mainly based on the infusion colour . The freeword association results show that daily and weekly consumers establish a stronger connection with the sensory emotional health and wellbeing dimensions of the product while less frequent consumers only consider the composition of the herbal infusion . From the observational study it was noticeable that most of the consumers take less than one minute to steep the infusions clearly below the four to ten minutes recommended for the most popular herbal infusions like lemon verbena or peppermint . These results emphasize the need for communication strategies focused on the preparation process to give consumers tools to improve their sensory experience .
267,The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of front of pack variations on consumer attention . In a laboratory experiment using an eye tracking method the authors exposed 165 respondents to planograms containing target products displaying identical FOPs or FOPs with variations . Attention was measured by fixation duration and fixation counts and eye movements were recorded at 250Hz . The findings showed that FOP variations catch respondents attention . Visual saliency has often been defined as a physical property of an object . In the current study we show the importance of also taking into account the interaction of one stimulus with other stimuli . To our knowledge this is the first time that the effects of FOP variations have been investigated . On a managerial level the current study offers a simple and low priced solution to cut through the clutter and catch consumers attention which is the first step to a product purchase .
268,Temporal Dominance of Sensations and Temporal Check All That Apply are the most popular methods used with consumers for the temporal sensory characterization of a set of products . However TDS and TCATA share the same limitation they rely on a predefined and necessarily short list of descriptors . Free Comment enables the sensory characterization of a set of products freed of any issue induced by the use of a list of descriptors but for practical reasons collecting FC descriptions concurrently to the product intake is nearly impossible . Attack Evolution Finish is an alternative to TDS and TCATA that replace concurrent by retrospective data collection . In AEF subjects are asked to choose in a list one descriptor for each of the so called periods Attack Evolution and Finish . The paper introduced Free Comment Attack Evolution Finish to extend FC to temporal sensory analysis where descriptor selections of AEF are replaced by FC descriptions . FC AEF has been used at home with 63 consumers having tasted five dark chocolates . The data were analysed product wise and period wise and showed that FC AEF enabled to provide temporal discrimination and characterization of the products . The product wise analyses identified in each period the descriptors of each product enabling this discrimination . The period wise analyses identified for each product the descriptors generating a temporal kinetic of its perception .
269,Due to its simplicity Check all that apply is a promising method for consumer studies with children to generate sensory and other descriptions of samples and to find their drivers of liking . This paper explores how childrens approach to the CATA test influences the outcome based on two case studies that illustrate suitable setups for CATA tests with children of the age group 69 . The children s approach to the CATA task was described with ticking style indicators based on which three ticking style groups were defined . One group ticked only a few attributes probably due to cognitive limitations e.g . lack of reading skills limited vocabulary or ability to focus on the task . The second group gradually increased their number of ticked attributes per sample over the test while the third subgroup ticked a steady number of attributes throughout the test . The two latter groups are likely to represent different test strategies one using the CATA list relatively to the sample space and one using the CATA list as in a more absolute way . Analysis regarding data validity assessed by the detection of pre defined Design of Experiment sample differences and the alignment to a trained panel using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis revealed that ticking style played a crucial role . This study shows the importance of analysing ticking style as a validation strategy for CATA tests run with children and as a tool to gain insights into underlying test strategies .
270,Both food image and name are important in advertising and packaging which means that identifying their effects on consumer preferences is of both conceptual and managerial importance . However although an increasing body of research currently focuses on the impact of food attributes on consumers whether the sensory correspondences between food shape and name typeface affect consumer reactions is an under researched topic . This paper thus comprises five studies to demonstrate the congruence effect between food shape and name typeface whereby consumers prefer foods with a round shape that are labeled with a round name typeface . This shapetypeface congruence effect is driven by the psychological mechanism of processing fluency which derives from the sensory correspondences between food shape and name typeface . Finally this study identifies an important boundary condition of the congruence effect confirming it affects only the consumer response to hedonic and not utilitarian goods . Using multiple foods and typefaces the findings provide significant implications for processing fluency sensory correspondences and food marketing .
271,Research on the relationship between vegetarianism and subjective well being has produced inconsistent results which may partly be due to small sample sizes and divergent operationalizations of well being . For these reasons the present study aimed to thoroughly examine this association in two large representative samples from Germany Study 1
272,The present research investigates the general effect of auditory noise control in individuals eating and drinking experiences . In particular the study applied passive vs active commercial headphone noise control techniques to an urban drinking situation . Here each participant drank twice the same coffee while exposed to a louder vs less loud version of the same background noise of a food court in busy hours . Note that by loud louder and less loud we are referring to differences in the sound level of the noise .
273,Satisfaction with food related life is one component of satisfaction with life . Although researchers have identified associations between satisfaction with food related life and specific food behaviours it is still not clear how consumers conceptualize this complex construct . The aims of the present study were to explore consumers conceptualization of SWFRL to compare how parents and adolescents in dual headed households perceive SWFRL and to identify aspects that would increase their SWFRL . One hundred and sixty four dual families composed of mother father and at least one adolescent child between 10 and 17years of age participated in the study . They completed a word association task with Being satisfied with my food related life and completed the sentence I would be more satisfied with my food related life if . Participants responses were aligned with the formal definition of SWFRL . References to specific foods and food characteristics were also mentioned in the word association task . No significant differences were found between parents and adolescents in the frequency of mention of responses related to the identified categories and supra categories suggesting lack of differences in their conceptualization of SWFRL . Changes in eating behaviours and individuals resources for purchasing and preparing foods were regarded as the main factors that could increase SWFRL . Differences between family members were found in some of the aspects associated with an increase in SWFRL . Results from this study can aid in the development of strategies for promoting changes in eating habits and increasing SWFRL targeted at different family members .
274,Involvement in vegetable preparation is thought to be an effective strategy to increase childrens vegetable intake but the evidence from experimental studies is scarce . A between subject experiment was executed in a restaurant setting to investigate the effect of participation in vegetable preparation on 46 year old childrens vegetable intake . After a baseline evening meal intervention children participated in a vegetable preparation session together with an enthusiastic chef . Control children participated in small groups in a book reading activity . Subsequently they ate an evening meal . Follow up sessions at one month and three months were included to assess possible longer term effects . Vegetable intake was the main outcome . Secondary outcomes were vegetable choice and involvement in food related activities at home . For all four sessions childrens vegetable intake ranged between 50 and 60g in both conditions . Participation in carrot preparation did not increase childrens vegetable intake . Involvement in food related activities at home remained stable in the intervention group whereas it decreased slightly in the control group . A cluster analysis identified four distinct vegetable eating patterns over time suggesting that there are different segments of children . To conclude participating once in an out of home vegetable preparation session with an enthusiastic chef did not influence childrens intake of a familiar vegetable but it may support their general involvement in food related activities at home .
275,Subjective taste intensity in adults is affected by the scent of food . Previous studies have shown that children compared with adults prefer sweet tasting foods as well as foods with a familiar smell . However how taste smell congruency and smell familiarity develop in early toddlerhood is still unclear . Here we examined the effects of the odours of soy sauce one of the most familiar foods in Japan and honey which is a sweet gustatory stimulus but unfamiliar to younger Japanese toddlers by comparing the sugared water consumption of toddlers under different odour conditions . Forty seven younger
276,The present study investigated the effects of thinking style health related consumption purpose and their interaction on food choice using yogurt packages . For each yogurt four 2 level label variables were used in a discrete choice experiment image taste description probiotics claim and nutritional information . The choice experiment was completed by 148 female study participants while their eye movements were recorded using a remote eye tracker . The expanded Cognitive Reflection Test was used to evaluate their thinking style . The participants self reports on the purpose of their yogurt consumption were used to evaluate whether or not the purpose of product consumption was associated with health per participant . Results from the choice task showed that both CRT and health related consumption purpose influenced the effect of image and nutritional information variables . For the participants visual attention the CRT significantly influenced all four label variables while health related consumption purpose only significantly influenced the image variable . Visual attention towards image decreased when the purpose of product consumption was associated with health . In addition the attention towards and the importance attached to nutritional information increased with increasing CRT scores but these effects were diminished when the participants purpose of product consumption was related to health . These results show that the influence of thinking style on food choice may be moderated by the consumers health related consumption purpose .
277,Traditionally wines have been described using lexicons and trained panels . However consumers of wine have varying knowledge about wine s sensory properties and they may interpret these attributes in different manners or use different words to describe the wines . As such the objective of the study was to investigate how consumers evaluate cool climate wines produced in Nova Scotia Canada . The study involved 972 wine consumers and 76 wines . Each wine was evaluated using projective mapping and ultra flash profiling . Each PM and UFP involved seven different wines and one replicate sample . The participants were able to distinguish between the different varieties of wine and positioned the identical samples together . Overall the participants used many attributes that described the taste and aroma of the wines as well as distinguished wines based on their sweetness and bitterness . The participants used very few terms to describe the mouthfeel and appearance of the wines . Based on these results wine producers and organizations may want to focus on educating consumers on the importance of mouthfeel and appearance attributes of wines . Overall the participants in this study had a low level of objective wine knowledge but they purchased wine frequently and were interested in wine . Wine producers and organizations should create labels that use descriptors that are used by consumers but also include descriptors that educate the consumers .
278,This preliminary study describes the impact of the COVID 19 health crisis on peoples interests opinions and behaviour towards food . Here the evolution of peoples internet searches the characteristics of the most watched YouTube videos and Tweeted messages in relation to COVID 19 and food was studied . Additionally an online questionnaire studied changes in food shopping habits during the lockdown motivations behind the changes and perceived reliability of the information received from media . Results showed initial trending searches and most watched YouTube videos were about understanding what COVID 19 is and how the illness can progress and spread . When the official statement of a pandemic was released trending searches in relation to food and shopping increased . Data retrieved from Twitter also showed an evolution from shopping concerns to the feeling of uncertainty for the oncoming crisis . The answers to the online questionnaire showed reduction of shopping frequency but no changes in shopping location . Products purchased with higher frequency were
279,A growing body of research has demonstrated the existence of cross modal correspondences that involve tastes and sounds . For example front vowels and voiceless consonants are more matched with sweetness than back vowels and voiced consonants . However research on taste sound correspondences so far has focused mainly on the vowel position and or consonant types . The literature on onomatopoeia and phonaesthetics suggests that vowel length can be used to convey pleasure or euphony and displeasure . This paper explores the linkages between vowel length and taste attributes . Specifically this paper investigated the link between long vowel sounds and sweetness . In three studies we demonstrate that people expect words containing long vowels to connote sweeter tastes than words containing short vowels . Our findings reveal the importance of vowel length in taste sound associations and show its linkage with the taste continuum .
280,Research on food waste reduction suggests that solutions aimed at reducing waste early in the consumption cycle are the most impactful . Based on this premise food research labs and food manufacturers have started creating and selling foods made from food ingredients that are generally discarded . Such foods termed upcycled foods are safe for human consumption and provide a promising solution to reduce food waste . However the commercial success of this new category of foods will depend on consumers acceptance . This research examines a key indicator of acceptance consumers willingness to pay . We find that although consumers are willing to pay less for upcycled foods compared to conventional alternatives messaging increases consumers willingness to pay . Specifically we find that rational messaging is more effective than emotional messaging . Overall our findings suggest that upcycled foods may command good acceptance among consumers .
281,Tooth segmentation acts as a crucial and fundamental role in dentistry for doctors to make diagnosis and treatment plans . In this paper we propose a Two Stage Attention Segmentation Network on dental panoramic X ray images to address the issues suffered in the tooth boundary and tooth root segmentation task which are caused by the low contrast and uneven intensity distribution . We firstly adopt an attention model which is embedded with global and local attention modules to roughly localize the tooth region in the first stage . Without any interactive operator the attention model so constructed can automatically aggregate pixel wise contextual information and identify coarse tooth boundaries . To better obtain final boundary information we use a fully convolutional network as the second stage to further segment the real tooth area from the attention maps obtained from the first stage . The effectiveness of TSASNet is substantiated on the benchmark dataset containing 1 500 dental panoramic X ray images our proposed method achieves 96.94 of accuracy 92.72 of dice and 93.77 of recall significantly superior to the current state of the art methods .
282,Dropout is commonly used in deep neural networks to alleviate the problem of overfitting . Conventionally the neurons in a layer indiscriminately share a fixed drop probability which results in difficulty in determining the appropriate value for different tasks . Moreover this static strategy will also incur serious degradation on performance when the conventional dropout is extensively applied to both shallow and deep layers . A question is whether selectively dropping the neurons would realize a better regularization effect . This paper proposes a simple and effective surrogate dropout method whereby neurons are dropped according to their importance . The proposed method has two main stages . The first stage trains a surrogate module that can be jointly optimized along with the neural network to evaluate the importance of each neuron . In the second stage the output of the surrogate module is regarded as a guidance signal for dropping certain neurons approximating the optimal per neuron drop rate when the network converges . Various convolutional neural network architectures and multiple datasets including CIFAR 10 CIFAR 100 SVHN Tiny ImageNet and two medical image datasets are used to evaluate the surrogate dropout method . The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better regularization effect than the baseline methods .
283,Linear discriminant analysis is among the most popular supervised dimensionality reduction algorithms which has been largely followed in the fields of pattern recognition and data mining . However LDA has three major drawbacks . One is the challenge brought by small sample size problem second makes it sensitive to outliers due to the use of squared
284,Clustering is a task used to group data from variegated sources including Big Data the Internet of Things and social media . Density peaks clustering has become a popular clustering technique for its simplicity and quality . However DPC requires a proper subset of input data points to be selected as centers using a plot called decision graph . This manual specification adds subjectivity and instability besides breaking the continuous flow of the algorithm . Automatic center detection approaches struggle with obtaining good results while avoiding to add parameters and complexity to the algorithm . We propose an approach to automatically determine cluster centers by detecting gaps between data points in a one dimensional version of the decision graph we detect these gaps heuristically by comparing the distance between pairs of consecutive points in terms of their gamma score . We tested our approach on synthetic and UCI data sets . Results show that the number of clusters is accurately predicted in comparison to other state of the art methods using F score and Adjusted Rand Index .
285,There has contradictions in timeliness and diversity in the design schemes of complex product systems . The traditional solidified knowledge template for the knowledge reuse purpose can not meet the rapid design needs of complex products . This paper proposes a configurable knowledge ontology model and a corresponding design method for rapid derivation of complex products . Based on the combination of basic knowledge elements customized knowledge elements and assorted knowledge elements a knowledge structural body is constructed by unitizing knowledge ontology into units of knowledge . And a dynamic structured knowledge template configuration method based on physical form configuration and virtual form association is proposed . The knowledge configuration information is transmitted and parsed in XML form and the virtual form is established to associate and dynamically configure the corresponding physical form knowledge structure . Based on the structured knowledge model configuration template a rapid derivative design method for electronic equipment is proposed . The rapid derivation design process is divided into three stages requirement analysis index demonstration and scheme formation . By establishing seven knowledge attributes such as global local scope retrieval the required product knowledge elements rule knowledge elements and tools are dynamically configured to realize the dynamic processing of design parameters based on configuration knowledge elements and then form a corresponding design scheme . Finally a rapid derivation design system is developed and applied to electronic equipment which verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model and method .
286,Community is an important property of networks . Recently label propagation based community detection algorithms develop rapidly since they can discover communities with high efficiency . However the results of most of them are inaccurate and unstable because the node order of label updating and the mechanism of label propagation are random . In this paper a new label propagation algorithm Graph Layout based Label Propagation Algorithm is proposed to reveal communities in networks which aims at detecting accurate communities and improving stability by exploiting multiple graph layout information . Firstly GLLPA draws networks to compact layout based on the force directed methods with
287,In this paper for the first time a feature selection procedure is modeled as a multi criteria decision making process . This method is applied to a multi label data and we have used the TOPSIS method as a famous MCDM algorithm to evaluate the features based on their relationship with multiple labels as different criteria . Our proposed method
288,Generalized zero shot classification is a challenging task to recognize test data which may come from seen or unseen classes . Existing methods suffer from the bias problem that the unseen images are easy to be misclassified to seen classes . Generating some fake unseen samples by Generative Adversarial Network has been a popular method . However these models are not easy to train . In this paper we proposed a method by learning domain invariant unseen features for generalized zero shot classification . Specifically we learn the support seen class set for each unseen class for transferring knowledge from source to target domain . The unseen samples of each class are generated based on the combinations of the samples from its support seen class set . In addition for dealing with the domain shift problem between source and target domains we learn domain invariant unseen features by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance of seen data generated unseen data and then project target data to the common space . For dealing with the bias problem we select some confident target unseen samples to augment training samples for training the classifier . In experiments we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state of the art methods .
289,Autonomous learning diagnostics where the students strengths and weaknesses are disclosed from their observed performance data is a challenging task in e learning systems . Current student knowledge models can alleviate some of the problems in learning
290,Domain adaptation learning is proposed as an effective technology for leveraging rich supervision knowledge from the related domain to learn a reliable classifier for a new domain . One popular kind of domain adaptation methods is based on feature representation . However such methods fail to consider the within class and between class relations after obtaining the new representation . In addition they do not consider the negative effects of features that might be redundant or irrelevant to the final classification . To this end a novel domain invariant feature learning method based on the maximum margin criterion and sparsity technique for unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed in this paper referred to as discriminative and informative joint distribution adaptation . Specifically DIJDA adopts the maximum margin criterion in the adaptation process such that the transformed samples are near to those in the same class but segregated from those in different classes . As a result the discriminative knowledge referred from source labels can be transferred to target domain effectively . Moreover DIJDA imposes a row sparsity constraint on the transformation matrix which enforces rows of the matrix corresponding to inessential feature attributes to be all zero . Therefore the most informative feature attributes can be extracted . Compared with several state of the art methods DIJDA substantially improves the classification results on five widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method .
291,Automatic and reliable fault diagnosis of rotating machinery cross working conditions is of practical importance . For this purpose ensemble transfer convolutional neural networks driven by multi channel signals are proposed in this paper . Firstly a series of source CNNs modified with stochastic pooling and Leaky rectified linear unit are pre trained using multi channel signals . Secondly the learned parameter knowledge of each individual source CNN is transferred to initialize the corresponding target CNN which is then fine tuned by a few target training samples . Finally a new decision fusion strategy is designed to flexibly fuse each individual target CNN to obtain the comprehensive result . The proposed method is used to analyze multi channel signals measured from rotating machinery . The comparison result shows the superiorities of the proposed method over the existing deep transfer learning methods .
292,In wireless sensor networks sensor nodes located close to the base station or sink are more susceptible to energy loss leading to premature disconnection of the network or energy holes . This is due to the fact that all traffic is forwarded towards the sink increasing the workloads for these closer nodes . One solution for this issue is to shorten the hop distance a sensors data has to travel until reaching the sink by deploying additional relay nodes . This paper considers the problem of optimal relay node placement for maximizing the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks in three dimensional terrains . We first design a mathematical model of the problem and reformulate it as a mixed integer programming model to provide a basis for finding lower bound solutions . We divide the problem into two phases and show that the second phase can be solved exactly using an algorithm based on maximum flow and binary search . We then propose a local search algorithm for the first phase utilizing the exact algorithm to create full solutions . Experimental validation on 3D datasets has been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms .
293,Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem . As opposed to population based algorithms which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space . Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models in which variables are treated independently and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations . Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non separable . In this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re Sampled Inheritance whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far . To assess the effect of the RI mechanism we extensively test various existing compact algorithms with and without RI and compare the best RI based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities . We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance . Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities .
294,This paper proposes a sparse representation layer in the feature extraction stage of a convolutional neural network . Our goal is to add sparse transforms to a target network to improve its performance without introducing an extra calculation burden . First the proposed method was achieved by inserting the sparse representation layers into a target networks shallow layers and the network was trained end to end using a supervised learning algorithm . Second In the forward pass the network captured the features through the convolutional layers and sparse representation layers accomplished with wavelet and shearlet transforms . Thirdly in the backward pass the weights of the learned kernels of the network were updated through a back propagated error while the sparse representation layers were fixed and did not require updating . The proposed method was verified on five datasets with the task of image classification FOOD 101 CIFAR10 100 DTD Brodatz and ImageNet . The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to higher recognition accuracy in image classification and the additional computational cost is relatively small compared to the baseline CNN model .
295,To avoid the curse of dimensionality resulting from a large number of features the most relevant features should be selected . Several scores involving must link and can not link constraints have been proposed to estimate the relevance of features . However these constraint scores evaluate features one by one and ignore any correlation between them . In addition they compute distance in the high dimensional original feature space to evaluate similarity between samples . So they would be corrupted by the curse of dimensionality . To deal with these drawbacks we propose a new constraint score based on a similarity matrix that is computed in the selected feature subspace and that makes it possible to evaluate the relevance of a feature subset at once . Experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate the improvement brought by the proposed constraint score in the context of both supervised and semi supervised learnings .
296,The large scale utilization of wind energy brings severe challenges to the dispatching operation of power systems . Currently the probability density prediction method combining quantile regression neural network with Epanechnikov kernel function is an excellent algorithm for wind power prediction which can give the comprehensive probability distribution of future wind power and effectively quantify the uncertainty of wind power generation . However existing probability density prediction methods process data sequentially in different quantiles and computational time costs multiply with the increase of training data . It affects the practicality of the probability density prediction method . To overcome this issue this paper proposes a multi core parallel quantile regression neural network based on parallel masterslave model . The algorithm divides the complex prediction tasks at all quantiles into multiple parallel sub tasks which are independently run on different cores so that performance advantages of the multi core CPU can be fully utilized for improving the computational efficiency of the joint operation model . We compare four different scale sample sets under different process numbers . The influence of different CPU core numbers on the parallel performance of MPQRNN are analyzed by the algorithmic nature of speedup and parallel efficiency . To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model comparative experiments of other four traditional models are carried out on data sets . The simulation results demonstrate that the MPQRNN can not only improve the training efficiency of QRNN but also obtain precise results of wind power forecasting showing potential value and utility for complex power system .
297,Knowledge and emotion play important roles in the process of crowd evacuation . Knowledge determines the moving direction of an individual and emotion determines the moving speed of an individual . However the existing works lack consideration of knowledge and emotion at the same time which results in unreasonable simulation of crowd evacuation . To solve this problem we propose a knowledge and emotion dual driven method for crowd evacuation simulation . First the knowledge representation and knowledge transmission are modeled to quantify the knowledge of evacuees . In this step the knowledge representation is modeled by differentiating the hazard source knowledge and the scenario knowledge and the factors affecting knowledge transmission are combined with the susceptible infected model to simulate the process of knowledge transmission . Second the emotion model is constructed to quantify the individual emotion in the evacuation process . In this paper the quantification of emotion takes into account two factors the influence of individual knowledge on emotion is quantified by using Siminovs psychology model the influence of emotional contagion among individuals is also considered . Then quantitative individual knowledge and emotion are combined with the reciprocal velocity obstacles model to build the knowledge and emotion dual driven crowd evacuation model . Finally we implement a 3D crowd simulation system based on the knowledge and emotion dual driven model to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis . The experimental results show that the proposed method can more realistically simulate crowd evacuation in an emergency situation .
298,The high cost of labeling data for analysis increased the interest in semi supervised learning especially constrained clustering which usually involves reduced cost . At the same time Active Learning aims to minimize the cost of creating labeled datasets by trying to identify which unlabeled data are more relevant for using during the learning process considering which labels are already available . This paper proposes four AL strategies to an evolutionary constrained clustering algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models with corresponding theoretical asymptotic analyses . These strategies use information from many different sources such as the partition the population and even specific aspects of the algorithm . We perform empirical evaluation on 14 well known datasets as a way to measure the impacts of each strategy both in relation to accuracy and labeling cost . The results were compared with baseline supervised algorithms as well as COBRAS a state of the art Active Learning algorithm for constrained clustering . Three of the proposed strategies obtained significantly better results than COBRAS in our empirical evaluation . Thus the combination of FIECE EM with these strategies can be considered viable alternatives for AL in a constrained clustering setting .
299,In this work deep learning based diagnostic procedure is developed for the identification of engine defects of 2 wheeler vehicle . The process starts with acquisition of vibration data . Second time domain signals are converted into angular domain . Third random distribution of angular domain signals is done to have training and test data . Further processing of training and test data is carried out using wavelet synchro squeezed transform to form timefrequency images . Then cost function of convolution neural network is modified by introducing a new entropy based regularization function in the existing cost function which can meaningfully reduce the activation in the hidden layer of CNN so as to make the learning really deep . Thereafter training of improved CNN is carried out using WSST images of training samples . In the next step WSST images of test data are applied to tuned CNN for the identification of defects . A comparison of proposed method has been carried by existing deep learning solutions and the method proposed in the state of artwork . The comparison shows that the proposed method is at least 3.8 more superior in terms of accuracy than the existing defect diagnosis methods while diagnosing defects of internal combustion engine of 2 wheeler vehicle .
300,The decisions of asset selection and allocation lie at the heart of financial portfolio management . For these challenging tasks the mathematical programming model of the meanvariance optimization problem proposes to use the concept of diversification . The novel methodology in this article is a representation of the accumulated knowledge of this model from the modern portfolio theory . It is a practical application for portfolio managers to help synthesize the available historical data and to infer rational decisions . The state of the art backtesting methodology integrates the unsupervised machine learning method of clustering analysis into the meanvariance portfolio optimization model . The test results from the proposed novel methodology show that clustering with Euclidean distance measures outperform the results of the benchmark and other specified clustering methods for different datasets backtesting periods and temporal scales of major stock indices .
301,High utility itemsets are sets of items that have a high utility in a transaction database . Discovering high utility itemsets has many important applications in real life such as market basket analysis . Nonetheless mining these patterns is a time consuming process due to the huge search space and the high cost of utility computation . Most of previous work is devoted to search space pruning but pay little attention to utility computation . Factually not only search space pruning but also high utility itemset identification have to resort to the computation of various utilities . This paper proposes a novel algorithm named REX which extends the classic d
302,In Deep Learning training a model properly with a high quantity and quality of data is crucial in order to achieve a good performance . In some tasks however the necessary data is not available at a particular moment and only becomes available over time . In which case incremental learning is used to train the model correctly . An open problem remains however in the form of the stabilityplasticity dilemma how to incrementally train a model that is able to respond well to new data while also retaining previous knowledge . In this paper an incremental learning model inspired in Rehearsal named CRIF is proposed and two instances for the framework are employed one using a random based selection of representative samples the other using Crowding Distance and Best vs. Second Best metrics in conjunction for this task . The experiments were performed on five datasets MNIST Fashion MNIST CIFAR 10 Caltech 101 and Tiny ImageNet in two different incremental scenarios a strictly class incremental scenario and a pseudo class incremental scenario with unbalanced data . In Caltech 101 Transfer Learning was used and in this scenario as well as in the other three datasets the proposed method NIL achieved better results in most of the quality metrics than comparison algorithms such as RMSProp Inc and iCaRL and outperformed the other proposed method RILBC . NIL also requires less time to achieve these results .
303,Credit risk assessment is usually regarded as an imbalanced classification task solved by static ensemble classifiers . However the dynamic ensemble selection strategy that can select different ensemble classifiers for each query sample is rarely used . Deficiency of the existing DES algorithm in dealing with imbalanced data is the major challenge . In this paper a novel combined DES model is developed for imbalanced learning problems . To handle the imbalanced data sets the synthetic minority over sampling technique is initially used to balance a training set before generating a candidate classifier pool then the weighting mechanism of DES MI is used to highlight the importance of minority instances when evaluating classifier competences . To further ensure the comprehensive evaluation and right selection of the ensemble classifier the meta learning framework of META DES is used to account for multiple criteria and the two step selection strategy of DES KNN is employed to perform a trade off between the competence and diversity of the classifiers . Our experiments on 15 imbalanced data sets from the KEEL repository show that the proposed model improves the performance of seven known and popular DES algorithms in terms of the area under the curve . Moreover the type I error rate of the proposed method is lower than that of XGBoost and LightGBM in a real P2P loan data set indicating the efficiency of the proposed method for credit risk assessment .
304,Combined heat and power economic dispatch is an important optimization task in the economic operation of power systems . The interdependence of heat and power outputs of cogeneration units and valve point effects of thermal units impose non convexity nonlinearity and complication in the dispatch modeling and optimization . In this paper a novel PSO algorithm called biogeography based learning particle swarm optimization is applied to solve the CHPED problem considering various constraints including power output balance heat production balance feasible operation area of cogeneration unit and prohibited operation zones . In BLPSO based on a biogeography based learning model each particle uses a migration operator to update itself based on the personal best position of all particles . This updating strategy helps BLPSO overcome premature convergence and improve solution accuracy . Moreover a repair technique is employed to handle the system constraints and guide the solutions toward feasible zones . The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by testing on four CHPED problems containing 5 7 24 and 48 units . The experimental results show that BLPSO outperforms the state of the art methods in terms of solution accuracy and stability . Therefore BLPSO can be regarded as a promising alternative for the CHPED problem .
305,During a practical detection process insufficient defect data unbalanced defect types and the high cost of defect labeling can present problems . Therefore it often takes considerable time and labor to collect actual samples to improve the accuracy of defect classification and recognition . In this paper we propose a weak supervision machine vision detection method based on artificial defect simulation . First four typical mobile phone screen defects scratches floaters light stains and severe stains are simulated by the proposed synthesis algorithms and an artificial defect database is created . Next the artificial dataset is applied to a deep learning recognition algorithm and an initial model is trained . Then the collected actual defects are augmented due to the insufficient training quantity . The augmented actual defects are then applied as the training data and the initial model is retrained by fine tuning . Finally the well retrained model is used for defect recognition . The experimental results demonstrate that satisfactory performance is achieved with the proposed detection method .
306,The purpose of multiple kernel learning is to learn an appropriate kernel from a set of predefined base kernels . Most of the MKL methods follow the basic idea of support vector machine to learn the optimal weights of base kernels and build the used classifier . However SVM is a local method and ignores the structure information of the data in that its solution is exclusively determined by the so called support vectors . In the paper we propose an improved SVM based MKL method called minimum class variance multiple kernel learning . The key characteristic of MCVMKL is that it exploits the ellipsoidal structure of the data during learning the optimal weights and building the classifier . Besides its formulation is invariant to scalings of the weights of base kernels . We develop two optimization strategies to handle the optimization model of MCVMKL . Further we derive a rough upper bound for the objective function of MCVMKL and propose a variant called trace constrained multiple kernel learning by using the trace of the within class scatter matrix . TCMKL enlarges the margin between different classes and simultaneously shrinks the region covering the data as much as possible . Moreover it can automatically tune the regularization parameter and so saves the training time due to avoiding using the time consuming cross validation technique to select an appropriate regularization parameter . Finally the comprehensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective and can achieve better performance over the competing methods .
307,As a digital representation of building projects Building Information Modeling can accumulate large volumes of log data containing hidden knowledge for deep exploration . However such ever increasing logs are likely to suffer from high complexity inaccuracy and uncertainty which will inevitably raise challenges in uncovering latent and meaningful patterns . In order to yield satisfactory clustering quality and efficiency for better design process management a novel clustering based BIM event log mining approach is put forward in this paper . For one thing a hybrid clustering algorithm named adaptive efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network is developed with a modified learning rate to accelerate the convergence . For another a new clustering validity index only relying on boundary points is designed to reduce computational complexity . An experiment is conducted in a 4 GB realistic BIM design event log dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method . It begins from extracting a set of features associated with designers engagement and efficiency and ends up retrieving inherent insights into the persons design behavioral patterns . Moreover the cluster analysis can significantly distinguish the design productivity at different time periods into the high medium and low level which presents a unique opportunity in understanding and assessing design productivity objectively . Practically our method can support data driven decision making for managers to strategically schedule personalized work for different designers aiming to boost design efficiency and smooth the design process .
308,Online crowdsourcing methods have proved useful for studies of diverse designs in the behavioral and addiction sciences . The remote and online setting of crowdsourcing research may provide easier access to unique participant populations and improved comfort for these participants in sharing sensitive health or behavioral information . To date few studies have evaluated the use of qualitative research methods on crowdsourcing platforms and even fewer have evaluated the quality of data gathered . The purpose of the present analysis was to document the feasibility and validity of using crowdsourcing techniques for collecting qualitative data among people who use drugs . Participants Qualitative data recruitment was feasible as evidenced by the rapid sampling of a relatively large number of participants from diverse geographic regions . Computerized text analysis indicated high ratings of authenticity for the provided narratives . These authenticity percentiles were higher than the average of general normative writing samples as well as than those collected in experimental settings . These findings support the feasibility and quality of qualitative data collected in online settings broadly and crowdsourced settings specifically . Future work among people who use drugs may leverage crowdsourcing methods and the access to hard to sample populations to complement existing studies in the human laboratory and clinic as well as those using other digital technology methods .
309,Despite several sources corroborating an expanding market and increased visibility and greater diversity in users profiles very little is known about the number of crack cocaine users in France . The estimates rely on a single data source capturerecapture method . Annual data are extracted from treatment centres nationwide . To account for heterogeneity we use an innovative zero truncated geometric regression based estimator controlling for individual and centre characteristics . We use the well known Zelterman estimator as a benchmark . The number of crack cocaine users received in treatment centres increased dramatically from 3388 in 2010 to 5143 in 2017 . The estimated number of crack cocaine users is believed to have tripled over the course of the same period to 28983 respectively with prevalences below 1 similar to other European countries . The coverage rate decreased in a similar fashion indicating lower utilization . In particular females and younger users are underestimated by data from treatment centres . The prevalence of crack cocaine use is fairly low but steadily increasing . The diversity in users profiles is a challenge to prevention and public health policies that should expand their scope to a more inclusive perspective of what defines crack cocaine users . Our method overcomes several methodological issues and can be easily applied to a wide range of settings .
310,Alcohol labels are one strategy for raising consumer awareness about the negative consequences of alcohol but evidence to inform labels is limited . This quasi experimental study sought to test the real world impact of strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels on consumer attention message processing and self reported drinking . Alcohol labels with a cancer warning national drinking guidelines and standard drink information were implemented in the intervention site and usual labelling practices continued in the comparison site . Changes in key indicators of label effectiveness were assessed among a cohort of adult drinkers in both the intervention and comparison sites using three waves of surveys conducted before and at two time points after the alcohol label intervention . Generalized Estimating Equations with difference in difference terms were used to examine the impact of the label intervention on changes in outcomes . Strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels significantly increased consumer attention to 17.2 95 CI 8.2 36.2 and processing of labels and consumer reports of drinking less due to the labels . Strengthening health messages on alcohol containers can achieve their goal of attracting attention deepening engagement and enhancing motivation to reduce alcohol use . Strengthening alcohol labelling policies should be a priority for alcohol control globally .
311,Australia bans the sale possession and use of liquid nicotine for vaping . One of the major arguments used to justify Australia s policy is that the availability of nicotine vaping products will lead a substantial number of young people who would otherwise not have smoked cigarettes to take up regular smoking . In this article we provide a critical analysis of the use of the gateway theory to justify Australian policy . We argue first that the evidence that vaping serves as a gateway to smoking is unconvincing . Smoking more often precedes vaping than vice versa regular vaping by never smokers is rare and the association is more plausibly explained by a common liability model . Second we argue that even if the evidence were stronger it would not justify a ban on the sale of nicotine to adult smokers because there are other ways of preventing adolescent vaping that do not require a ban . We describe an alternative regulatory model for Australia that would address legitimate concerns about preventing adolescent uptake while allowing adult smokers to access these products for cessation or as an alternative to smoking cigarettes .
312,Drug overdose is a significant public health problem yet little is known about racial ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration . This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship response revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1 2018 and December 31 2019 . Spatio temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development planning and delivery of effective treatment need . Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network . The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age gender and race ethnicity naloxone administrations and survivorship drug suspected of causing the overdose victim outcomes and average naloxone dosage per victim . Between group differences were tested using 2 tests of independence . Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics . All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment . About eighty seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white and seventy one percent were between the ages of 2039 . White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females . A non opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos . Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose . However following naloxone administration no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted . Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found . Finally overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites . This study found a significant disparate impact of race ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered . Further individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug related mortality suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose . However while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis .
313,Housing is a critical determinant of HIV related outcomes among people living with HIV who use drugs including on HIV treatment adherence . Research shows that sense of home may have important implications for mitigating harms associated with low income housing environments among PLHIV who use drugs but how this shapes treatment is poorly understood . Semi structured interviews were conducted with 31 PLHIV who use drugs recruited from an ongoing prospective cohort in Vancouver Canada . Recruitment was targeted towards individuals living in single room occupancy housing who had previously reported low treatment adherence . Interviews were co led with a peer research assistant and focused on housing conditions drug use patterns and HIV management . Interviews were transcribed analyzed thematically and interpreted by drawing on concepts of home and place making . The ability to exert control over housing environments contributed to participants perceptions of home by fostering feelings of safety and allowing for creation of personalized space . Participants readily identified the importance of housing stability and quality in maintaining health including HIV care . However informed by social structural mechanisms that undermined agency negative experiences of home adversely impacted treatment adherence . Findings indicate that sense of home may enable ability to manage HIV care and is promoted through feelings of security within and control over housing environments . Supports in navigating competitive housing markets are needed to address the role that home plays in HIV treatment adherence .
314,Catalonia requires decentralized and simplified strategies for the diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among people who inject drugs . We aimed to perform a direct comparison of the diagnostic performance between two single step strategies for the screening and diagnosis of viremic HCV infection in PWID attending a drug consumption room in Barcelona i on site HCV RNA testing using the point of care test Xpert HCV VL Fingerstick and ii on site dried blood spots collection for HCV RNA testing at the laboratory . Additionally we aimed to assess participants preferences in receiving HCV RNA testing results and feasibility of same day delivery of PoCT results . The real world clinical performance of these two strategies was established in comparison with the reference method . HCV genotypes subtypes and HIV status were also determined by sequencing and serology respectively . A questionnaire including preferences regarding the delivery of test results was administered . The prevalence of HCV RNA was 63.0 . The RNA PoCT showed a sensitivity of 98.4 for detectable viral loads and of 100 for quantifiable viral loads . For the DBS based assay a sensitivity of 93.7 was obtained for detectable viral loads 96.7 for the quantifiable 10 IU mL threshold and 98.3 for both the quantifiable 1000 and 3000 IU mL thresholds . No significant differences were detected between the sensitivity values of these two strategies and the specificity was 100 in both cases . Half of the participants preferred to receive the HCV RNA result on the same day and 80 of participants received their RNA PoCT results on the same day . Both the HCV RNA PoCT and the DBS based assay are highly reliable tools for the simplified diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among current PWID . These strategies allow for on site sample collection and delivery of test results facilitating decentralized care in harm reduction services .
315,People who inject drugs have high rates of hepatitis C and yet many remain undiagnosed and untreated . HCV treatment guidelines and elimination strategies recommend task shifting to expand where and by whom HCV testing and care is delivered . A randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate if point of care HCV antibody testing by peer outreach workers outside of health and social service spaces would improve engagement in HCV care . People with a lifetime history of injection drug use without prior knowledge of HCV antibody status were randomized to receive HCV outreach plus either POC or referral to community based HCV program for testing as usual . The study was co designed by people with lived experience of HCV . 920 people were approached to participate over 14 weeks . After refusals withdrawals and removal of duplicates there were 380 study participants . Outreach took place primarily in public spaces such as parks coffee shops and apartment lobbies . Participants reported very high rates of poverty housing instability and recent injection drug use . Despite being at high risk for HCV 61 had no history or knowledge of past HCV testing Peer outreach workers were able to efficiently reach a marginalized group of individuals who had a high HCV antibody prevalence and low rates of prior HCV testing . This improved participants knowledge of their HCV antibody status but that knowledge in itself did not lead to any change in participant s subsequent engagement in HCV care . Future work is required to evaluate strategies such as incentives or peer navigators to improve linkage to HCV care after diagnosis .
316,Drug checking services aim to provide people who use drugs with information on the content and purity of their substances as a harm reduction intervention . The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between injecting alone and use of drug checking services in Vancouver Canada . Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of people who inject drugs . We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of injecting alone on use of drug checking services . Between May 2018 and December 2018 a total of 793 people who inject drugs were included in the study 579 reported injecting alone and 177 reported use of drug checking services . In a multivariable model adjusted for various confounders injecting alone was negatively associated with use of drug checking services . We observed a negative association between injecting drugs alone and use of drug checking services which may be due in part to a number of exogenous factors that prevent people who inject alone from accessing drug checking services . As these individuals are at heightened risk of experiencing overdoses there is a need to pursue other strategies to reach this group of people who use drugs .
317,This paper presents an assessment of the current emergency response to homeless people who use substances in Montreal a major North American city . This project addresses the rising concern about homelessness in high income countries . Several studies have shown that homeless people frequently use emergency services especially in the context of substance use . Yet the key actors perspectives are poorly documented .
318,The Australian medicines regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled all codeine containing medicines to be available only on prescription on 1 February 2018 . This study was conducted to determine whether use of analgesics changed following codeine re scheduling to prescription only status and whether there was a change in the use of codeine preparations and a therapeutic shift to stronger opioids or other analgesics in the Australian veteran population following the change . Interrupted time series analysis using Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme claims data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs for clients with dispensing of opioid and non opioid analgesics between January 2015 and April 2019 . Trends in the monthly rate of analgesic dispensings were compared for the period between January 2015 and January 2018 with the period February 2018 to April 2019 . Paracetamol with codeine 8mg was the only analgesic with an increased rate of dispensing following the February 2018 codeine scheduling changes . Prior to codeine re scheduling the rate of dispensing of paracetamol with codeine 8mg was decreasing by 0.9 each month . Immediately after the scheduling changes dispensing of paracetamol with codeine 8mg increased by 45 and in the fifteen month period thereafter the rate of dispensing increased by 4 each month . Therapeutic shift from over the counter codeine products to other opioids was not observed with no increase in the rate of dispensing of any of the other opioid analgesics following the codeine scheduling changes . A significant increase in prescription use of paracetamol with codeine 8mg was observed after the February 2018 codeine re scheduling . Therapeutic shift to stronger opioid analgesics was not observed in the study population .
319,Background Policies aimed at addressing the high rates of opioid overdose have prioritized increasing access to medications for treatment of opioid use disorder . Numerous barriers exist to providing MOUD within the criminal justice system and or to justice involved populations . The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the peer reviewed literature on implementation of MOUD within criminal justice settings and with justice involved populations .
320,We see the contours of a cigarette free adolescent cohort in Norway . Simultaneously increasing use of vaping devices among adolescents internationally and in the US in particular has evoked fear of a new nicotine addicted generation . This longitudinal study explores the vaping phenomenon in a context where nicotine e liquid is still prohibited . Data are from longitudinal qualitative interviews with a sizable sample of 12 17 year olds 118 8 Gradual and collective shifts in vaping practices and in the symbolic meaning of vaping were observed in three phases . First in 8 E cigarettes were devalued from novelty and transgression to childish and uninteresting within the same sample over a four year period . In conclusion e cigarettes in the sample represented fashionable experimentation rather than steady user patterns .
321,Online sampling is widely used to recruit hard to reach samples such as drug users at nightlife events . We conducted the first study comparing differences in demographics drug use and nightlife behaviour between an online sample of young adults engaging with the European nightlife scene and an offline sample recruited at nightclubs and festivals in Europe . Online participants who attended at least six nightlife events in the past 12 months were recruited using social media advertising . Offline participants were recruited at nightclubs and festivals using a random intercept method . Samples were compared with respect to age gender past year use of alcohol cannabis cocaine ecstasy MDMA and amphetamines and past year attendance at nightclubs licensed festivals illegal festivals pubs and house parties . 6153 online and 3529 offline participants were recruited . When adjusting for differences in age and gender online participants were less likely to have used each drug and to have attended illegal festivals pubs and house parties in the past 12 months . The online sample also used each drug and attended each venue with the exception of nightclubs less frequently on average than offline participants . Adjusted odds ratios and regression coefficients indicate that the majority of observed differences between the samples were of a small effect size . Estimates of drug use and nightlife engagement are more conservative when using online sampling compared to venue based sampling . Observed differences were generally small in effect indicating good overall representativeness when using online sampling in the European nightlife scene .
322,This study examined the effects of the iPlayClean anti doping intervention on attitudes towards doping and susceptibility and whether delivery mode affected the results .
323,In 2017 there were large increases in overdose deaths among women in the United States across age groups . In addition U.S. women who inject drugs are at increased risk for substance use related disease transmission bacterial infections as well as sexual and physical violence compared to men who inject drugs . Relatedly women face unique access barriers to substance use related services such as stigma and low coverage of gender specific drug use related services . Despite these heightened risks experienced by WWID interventions specifically tailored to preventing women from transitioning into injection drug use have not been developed to date . As such we advocate for the development of gender responsive programs to prevent injection drug use initiation . This is critical to ensuring a comprehensive approach to preventing injection drug use initiation among those populations at highest risk of injection related morbidity and mortality .
324,Previous research found inconsistent associations between alcohol control policies and socioeconomic inequality with adolescent drinking outcomes . This study expands the focus beyond individual associations to examine whether a combination of policies is related to socioeconomic inequality in adolescent drinking outcomes and whether this relationship varies across survey years .
325,Factors and policies which potentially explain the changes in alcohol consumption and related harms from 2010 to 2017 in 11 middle income countries in the South East Asian region were examined .
326,In some U.S. states laws prohibit sales of recreational marijuana to intoxicated customers to prevent associated harms . In alcohol markets training in responsible sales practices is one intervention to help reduce such sales to intoxicated customers . Similar training may be beneficial in the recreational cannabis market . An online responsible marijuana vendor training was developed . Among its five modules learning elements taught store personnel to recognize signs of alcohol impairment and intoxication refuse sales and understand the risks of driving under the influence of cannabis . A sample of Deterrence of sales to intoxicated customers does not seem to exist regardless of whether the states laws prohibit it . Only 16 of 146 stores refused sales . There was no difference in refusal rates between intervention and control stores Training in responsible sales practices alone did not appear to reduce sales to apparently alcohol intoxicated customers . Legal deterrence from making these sales may be insufficient or nonexistent for store management to support adherence to this responsible sales practice . Regulatory and policy actions may be needed to increase perceived risk with such sales to achieve training s benefits .
327,Medical marijuana laws can impact marijuana and opioid use but the relationship between MMLs and other drugs such as prescription stimulants remains unexamined . Because lesbian gay and bisexual individuals report higher levels of prescription stimulant use than heterosexuals we explored the relationship between MMLs and past year medical and non medical stimulant use by sexual identity and gender . We pooled 20152017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data for adults and non medical stimulant use 6.6 versus 2.4 aROR 2.23 than heterosexual men . Bisexual women had higher non medical stimulant use than heterosexual women . Female and male heterosexuals in MML states had lower odds of medical stimulant use than in non MML states . Bisexual men in MML states had lower odds of medical and non medical stimulant use than bisexual men in non MML states . Similar patterns emerged for bisexual women s non medical use . Prescription stimulant use was higher in non MML states for most LGB subgroups . MMLs may differentially impact stimulant use primarily for bisexual men and women . States enacting MMLs should consider potential impacts on drugs other than marijuana especially among LGB populations .
328,Although people who use drugs are a high risk group for tuberculosis there is practically no data on TB prevalence in Ivory Coast . The aim of the study was to estimate pulmonary TB prevalence and assess the cascade of care with confirmed pulmonary TB among PWUD in Abidjan .
329,The United States and Canada are in the midst of an overdose epidemic fueled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl . While marked differences in vulnerability to drug related harm between men and women who use drugs is well characterized the extent to which gender differences manifest in the present overdose crisis remains understudied . We examined differences in self reported unintentional exposure to fentanyl between men and women who use drugs . Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of people who use drugs in Vancouver Canada . Survey data were extracted on individuals who self reported having used drugs known or believed to contain fentanyl in the past 30 days between December 2016 and November 2017 . We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between self identified gender and self reported unintentional exposure to fentanyl . As a sub analysis correlates of self reported unintentional exposure to fentanyl were identified using MLR stratified by gender . Of 578 eligible participants including 219 women 200 perceived their exposure to fentanyl as unintentional . In the MLR being a woman was positively associated with self reported unintentional fentanyl exposure . Among women at least daily heroin use was negatively associated with self reported unintentional fentanyl exposure while perceiving a high or moderate risk of overdosing on fentanyl was positively associated with outcome . Among men older age was positively associated with self reported unintentional fentanyl exposure while injection drug use and at least daily heroin use was negatively associated with the outcome all Women were more than two times as likely to self report they were unintentionally exposed to fentanyl compared to men . These findings highlight the urgent need to further understand experiences of gender based risk differences and develop gender focused interventions and policies aimed at preventing drug related harm .
330,Injecting risk behaviour such as receptive sharing of injecting equipment and or re using one s equipment is associated with bloodborne virus transmission and infections in people who inject drugs . We aimed to estimate prevalence and correlates of injecting risk behaviours amongst PWID . We conducted a systematic review and meta analyses to estimate country regional and global prevalences of injecting risk behaviours . Using meta regression analyses we determined associations between study and country level characteristics and receptive needle syringe sharing . From 61 077 identified papers and reports and 61 studies from expert consutation evidence on injecting risk behaviours was available for 464 studies from 88 countries . Globally it is estimated that 17.9 of PWID engaged in receptive needle syringe sharing at last injection 23.9 in the past month and 32.8 in the past 612 months . Receptive sharing of other injecting equipment was common . Higher prevalence of receptive needle syringe sharing in the previous month was associated with samples of PWID with a lower proportion of females shorter average injecting duration a higher proportion with daily injecting and older studies . Countries with lower development index higher gender inequality and lower NSP coverage had higher proportions reporting receptive needle syringe sharing . High levels of injecting risk behaviours were observed amongst PWID globally although estimates were only available for half of the countries with evidence of injecting drug use . There is a need for better capturing of injecting risk behaviours in these countries to inform implementation of harm reduction services and evaluate potential impacts of interventions to reduce risk .
331,People who drink alcohol often seek to manage their intake in order to maximise the pleasurable effects such as feelings of sociability and relaxation without reaching their tipping point where they feel out of control or unwell . This paper aimed to explore three stages of intoxication feeling the effects being as drunk as you would like to be and reaching the tipping point in a large international sample . The Global Drug Survey is an annual cross sectional online survey of drug use . This paper draws on data from 61 043 respondents from 21 countries who took part in GDS2015 collected in November 2014 to January 2015 . Respondents reported their usual type of drink how many drinks they would require to reach each stage of intoxication and how frequently they reached each stage . Alongside socio demographic measures they also completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test . Male respondents reported consuming 87.55 gm to be as drunk as they want to be and female respondents reported 70.16 gm on average . The tipping point was reached at 138.65 gm for male respondents and 106.54 gm for female respondents . Overall 20.3 reported reaching their tipping point at least once a month . Being male aged under 25 and at higher risk for alcohol use disorder was associated with reporting reaching the tipping point more frequently . The amount of alcohol being consumed to reach a desired point of intoxication is much higher than the maximum daily and sometimes weekly amount recommended by country guidelines . Encouraging people to avoid reaching their tipping point may be a useful intervention point alongside better communication of low risk drinking guidelines .
332,Illicit drug use is associated with severe health related harms yet people who use drugs face substantial barriers to healthcare . We sought to identify factors associated with disclosure of drug use to a healthcare provider and describe differences in self reported quality of care received based on disclosure status . A client reported experience questionnaire on healthcare access and quality adapted from the World Health Organization Survey on Health and Health System Responsiveness was administered within two ongoing prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver Canada . Respondents not currently receiving addiction treatment were asked about experience of care and drug use disclosure to their most commonly accessed outpatient healthcare provider in the past 6 months . We used an adjusted logistic regression model to identify client characteristics associated with disclosure . From a total of 261 respondents less than half In a sample of PWUD accessing outpatient healthcare services we observed low rates of drug use disclosure particularly for Indigenous respondents and reduced quality of care for those who disclosed . These findings highlight the need for culturally safe and non stigmatizing care to address pervasive stereotyping in the healthcare system and improved screening for substance use disorder in outpatient healthcare services .
333,Georgia launched national HCV elimination program in 2015 . PWID may experience barriers to accessing HCV care . To improve linkage to care among PWID pilot program to integrate HCV treatment with HR services at opiate substitution therapy centers and needle syringe program sites was initiated . Our study aimed to assess satisfaction of patients with integrated HCV treatment services at HR centers . Survey was conducted among convenience sample of patients receiving HCV treatment at 5 integrated care sites and 4 specialized clinics not providing HR services . Simplified pre treatment diagnostic algorithm and treatment monitoring procedure was introduced for HCV treatment programs at OST NSP centers which includes fewer pre treatment and monitoring tests compared to standard algorithm . In total 358 patients participated in the survey 48.6 receiving HCV treatment at the specialized clinics while 51.4 at HR site with integrated treatment . Similar proportions of surveyed patients at HR sites and clinics stated that they did not face any barriers to enrollment in the elimination program . Most patients from HR pilot sites and specialized clinics stated that they received comprehensive information about the treatment 98.4 vs 94.3 Quality of services and perceived satisfaction of patients receiving treatment suggests that integration of HCV treatment with HR services is feasible .
334,In Baltimore the emergence of fentanyl and its analogues exacerbated an existing heroin crisis and increased uncertainty about drug composition and potency . In an effort to reduce overdoses harm reduction organizations and health departments across the U.S. began distributing fentanyl test strips a low barrier inexpensive drug checking strategy . Studies show that people who use drugs frequently suspect that their drugs contain fentanyl and are interested in using fentanyl test strips to check their drugs however some people question their usefulness in regions where fentanyl presence is assumed . Understanding the utility of fentanyl test strips in fentanyl saturated markets isapriority to best tailor interventions . In depth interviews Fentanyl was viewed as pervasive dangerous and difficult to avoid in the local drug supply . This dominant narrative characterized PWUD as disempowered by the heightened unpredictability of the drug market . While several strategies are used to navigate the drug market respondents wanted more information about their drugs . In this context fentanyl test strips were used in unique and unexpected ways to empower PWUD to be savvier market consumers including avoiding fentanyl when there could be negative social or legal consequences negotiating with dealers and helping others in their social network navigate the opaque drug market . These findings add nuance and place fentanyl preference and use in the context of the drug market . When fentanyl presence is assumed people used fentanyl test strips in unexpected ways to gain some control over their drug use . Novel uses for fentanyl test strips strengthen existing strategies used to navigate the drug market and mitigate overdose risk and highlight their potential to quickly disseminate valuable information about the local drug supply .
335,Engaging the community in decisions making is recognised as important for improving public health and is recommended in global alcohol strategies and in national policies on controlling alcohol availability . Yet there is little understanding of We conducted case studies in three local government areas in England in 2018 purposively selected for examples of community engagement in decisions affecting the local alcohol environment . We conducted 20 semi structured interviews with residents workers local politicians and local government practitioners and analysed documents linked to engagement and alcohol decision making . Four rationales for engaging the community in decision making affecting the alcohol environment were identified i as part of statutory decision making processes ii to develop new policies iii as representation on committees and iv occurring through relationship building . Many of the examples related to alcohol licensing processes but also local economy and community safety decision making . The impact of community inputs on decisions was often not clear but there were a few instances of engagement influencing the process and outcome of decision making relating to the alcohol environment . While influencing statutory licensing decision making is challenging community experiences of alcohol related harms can be valuable evidence to support new licensing policies . Informal relationship building between communities and local government is also beneficial for sharing information about alcohol related harms and to facilitate future engagement . However care must be taken to balance the different interests among diverse community actors relating to the local alcohol environment and extra support is needed for those with least capacity to engage but who face more burden of alcohol related harms to avoid compounding existing inequalities .
336,To determine the prevalence patterns of use and consequences of inhaling alcohol vapour or mist . Cross sectional survey recruiting an international non probability sample of people who use alcohol and other drugs as part of the annual Global Drug Survey . Online questionnaire translated into 19 languages . 110 557 people took part in GDS2020 and 88 124 completed a question about inhaling alcohol in the last 12 months . The focus of this study is GDS2020 respondents who reported inhaling alcohol mist vapour from a balloon in the last 12 months . Last 12 month use of alcohol vapour onset duration intensity of effects value for money compared with alcohol and incidence of falls injuries . A total of 803 people reported the use of alcohol vapour in the last 12 months with 51 of the sample coming from 3 countries Australia Denmark and England . Two thirds were male and they were more likely to be under 25 . 45.7 reported that they were a bit very drunk before they inhaled alcohol . 51.3 reported that the effects lasted for less than 5mins . Both the intensity of effect and perceived value for money showed a normal distribution on a 10 point scale . 12.7 of respondents reported falling injuring themselves . Inhaling alcohol vapour appears to be more common amongst younger higher risk drinkers . The rapid onset of action and inability to titrate consumption to effect is a risk for acute injury . We consider that alcohol is harmful enough through oral consumption without adding to the risk of injury by offering such a potentially risky additional administration method .
337,Within the context of the ongoing overdose crisis and limitations of conventional opioid treatments the scale up of injectable hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine as evidenced based treatments is currently underway in some settings in Canada . Past research has underscored the importance of treatment initiation in shaping onward treatment trajectories however structural factors that influence participants motivations to access injectable HDM or DAM have not been fully characterized . This study examines peoples motivations for accessing HDM DAM treatment and situates these within the social and structural context that shapes treatment delivery by employing the concept of structural vulnerability . Fifty two individuals enrolled in injectable HDM DAM programs were recruited from four community based clinical programs in Vancouver Canada to participate in qualitative semi structured interviews . Approximately 50h of ethnographic fieldwork was also completed in one clinical setting and one on one with participants public spaces . Interview transcripts and ethnographic fieldnotes were analyzed through a structural vulnerability lens with a focus on treatment initiation . Participants previous experiences and perceptions of other drug treatments foregrounded their initiation of injectable HDM DAM . Social and structural factors influenced participants motivations to address immediate physical risks and their initial perception of this treatment s ability to align with their opioid use experiences . Similar social and structural factors that drive immediate physical risks were also evidenced in participants motivations to make changes in their daily lives and to address broader opioid use goals . Participants descriptions of their motivations to initiate HDM DAM highlight how structural vulnerabilities shaped participants experiences initiating injectable HDM DAM .
338,With increased use of electronic nicotine delivery devices and non cigarettes tobacco products among adolescents the percentage of Italian students who use nicotine products is at its highest level of the past ten years even though prevention and anti smoking policies have produced tangible results in decreasing tobacco smoking prevalence . This cross sectional study examined trends in exclusive and dual smoking identified new poly consumption patterns and profiled old and new nicotine users . We used the annual cross sectional ESPAD Italia survey which sampled students currently used for surveillance and monitoring of at risk population between 2012 and 2018 The lifetime prevalence of cigarette smokers slightly decreased from 60.9 in 2012 to 56.9 in 2018 whereas the proportion of vaping users substantially increased from 32.9 in 2013 to 52.0 in 2018 . Combining cigarette and vaping use these trends result in an increase in the lifetime prevalence of any use from 60.8 in 2013 to 66.2 in 2018 . Three out of every 10 minors have experienced smoking and or vaping and younger students were more prone to be dual users . Overall current vapers were generally less prone to risky behaviours . In contrast to a slight decrease in cigarette smoking the prevalence of Italian students approaching old and or new smoking habits in their lifetime is substantially increasing . The popularity of alternative nicotine based products particularly e cigarettes has increased among teenagers resulting in a summation of usage patterns rather than a compensation and attracting a novel slice of young users . The lack of regulation within current drug policy to limit the access to such licit psychoactive substance use is urgently needed to avoid a future nicotine addicted population .
339,Evidence details how cannabis can influence the use of other psychoactive substances including prescription medications alcohol tobacco and illicit drugs but very little research has examined the factors associated with these changes in substance use patterns . This paper explores the self reported use of cannabis as a substitute for alcohol among a Canadian medical cannabis patient population . Data was derived from a survey of 2102 people enrolled in the Canadian medical cannabis program . We included 973 respondents who reported using alcohol on at least 10 occasions over a 12 month period prior to initiating medical cannabis and then used retrospective data on the frequency and amount of alcohol use pre and post medical cannabis initiation to determine which participant characteristics and other variables were associated with reductions and or cessation of alcohol use . Overall 419 participants reported decreases in alcohol usage frequency over 30 days 323 decreased the number of standard drinks they had per week and 76 reported no alcohol use at all in the 30 days prior to the survey . Being below 55 years of age and reporting higher rates of alcohol use in the pre period were both associated with greater odds of reducing alcohol use and an intention to use medical cannabis to reduce alcohol consumption was associated with significantly greater odds of both reducing and ceasing alcohol use altogether . Our findings suggest that medical cannabis initiation may be associated with self reported reductions and cessation of alcohol use among medical cannabis patients . Since alcohol is the most prevalent recreational substance in North America and its use results in significant rates of criminality morbidity and mortality these findings may result in improved health outcomes for medical cannabis patients as well as overall improvements in public health and safety .
340,People who require help injecting illicit drugs experience elevated rates of a range of health related harms including overdose and acquisition of blood borne pathogens . In response some supervised injection services in Canada have begun to permit clients to be physically injected by fellow clients or staff members . However little is known about uptake and characteristics of clients who engage in this practice . We therefore sought to examine factors associated with receiving injection assistance at SIS among people who require help injecting drugs in Vancouver Canada . Data were drawn from two community recruited prospective cohort studies of people who inject drugs . We used multivariable generalized estimating equation analyses with time updated covariates to identify factors associated with self reported receipt of injection assistance at SIS . Between June 2017 and December 2018 319 individuals who reported having recently required help injecting were included in the study . Of these 160 were women and the median age was 42 years at baseline . In total 54 participants reported receiving injection assistance at a SIS at least once over an average of 3.3 months of follow up . In multivariable GEE analyses recent homelessness 2.04 95 confidence interval 1.13 3.66 fentanyl injection non fatal overdose and enrolment in methadone maintenance therapy were associated with increased odds of receiving injection assistance at SIS . Although uptake of assisted injection at SIS was relatively low among this sample of people who require help injecting this practice was associated with several indicators of structural vulnerability and drug related risk . These findings suggest that accommodating assisted injection within SIS may be providing opportunities to engage and reduce harms among higher risk subpopulations of PWID in this setting .
341,The ways in which young people learn about cannabis product availability and where they obtain cannabis products are important to understand for prevention and intervention efforts . Young adults who reported past month cannabis use 51.5 from family or friends 39.1 from medical cannabis dispensaries and 5.5 from strangers or dealers in the past month . Compared to those getting cannabis from family or friends those getting cannabis from MCDs or RCRs spent more money used more cannabis products were more likely to use alone used greater quantities of bud flower and reported more consequences from use . Further those obtaining cannabis from MCDs were more likely to screen positive for cannabis use disorder . For type of products those obtaining cannabis from MCDs or RCRs were more likely to use joints bongs pipes dabs vape and consume edibles relative to those obtaining from family or friends . Subgroup differences were found for both source patterns and cannabis related outcomes . Males and those with a cannabis medical card reported spending more money on cannabis using more types of products and indicated more frequent use and greater CUD symptoms and consequences . Compared to Whites Blacks spent more money on cannabis and used more products and Hispanics reported using more products and greater quantities of cannabis bud flower . Findings highlight the different ways that young adults obtain cannabis and how young adults with a medical cannabis card may be at greater risk for problems compared to young adults who use cannabis recreationally .
342,Globally research on the co infection of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs is growing . However studies in resource poor countries remain limited . Therefore we conducted this study to explore factors associated with HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia . This national survey was conducted in 2017 in the capital city and 11 provinces . We used a peer based social network recruitment method to recruit 286 participants for face to face interviews and HIV and HCV testing . A modified Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify risk factors associated with HIV HCV co infection . The prevalence of HIV and HCV was 15.4 and 30.4 respectively . Of the total 9.4 of the participants were HIV HCV co infected and 61.4 of the HIV infected participants were co infected with HCV . About half of the participants tested HIV positive were aware of their HIV status of whom 83.3 were on antiretroviral therapy . Only 11.5 of the participants with HCV antibody positivity were aware of their HCV infection status of whom 50.0 were on HCV treatment . The adjusted prevalence ratio of HIV HCV co infection was significantly higher among women than among men and among participants who lived on the streets than among those living with their family or relatives . The APR of HIV HCV co infection was also significantly higher among participants who had received methadone maintenance therapy than those who had not received it . The prevalence of HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia was considerably high . Intervention programs are required to increase access to harm reduction interventions among most marginalized people who inject drugs to prevent HIV and HCV infection . HCV screening services should be expanded in this key population given its small population size and the availability of directly acting antiviral agents in the country .
343,LED lamps have already conquered the market of general lighting . This new product will generate a substantial flow of e waste requiring studies for the correct management especially concerning recycling alternatives . This study proposes a material characterization of all the tubular and bulb LED lamp components .

344,Cables and wires have a widespread use due to their application in electric power and data transmission . Since they consist of a conductive core and an insulating layer they can be brought back to life after disposal through recycling in the form of secondary raw materials such as copper aluminium and or polymer . The aim of this paper is to research the possibilities of electrostatic separation use for separating aluminium left in residue fraction after the process of recycling Al waste electric cables as well as to determine the influence of operating parameters and the optimal separation conditions . Waste fraction characterisation has determined that aluminium is mainly found in smallsize particles with the mass fraction higher than 60 . During the research planning the central composite design was used and three operating variables of an electrostatic separator were tested roll speed voltage and separation splitter position . Results have shown that it is possible to obtain a concentrate with the Al mass fraction of 97.86 at 91.20 recovery . It has been shown that the splitter position has the most significant influence on the grade of concentrate and recovery . It has also been shown that the roll speed individually and the interaction of the roll speed and splitter position have a significant influence on the grade of concentrate .
345,Biodiesel was prepared at laboratory scale via transesterification reaction from waste cooking oil using Sr Ti mixed metal oxide as a heterogeneous base catalyst . The solid base catalyst was synthesized by polymer precursor method . The most efficient active phase of catalyst was explored by varying the Sr Ti atomic ratio in mixed metals oxides . The synthesized catalyst underwent for TGA Powder XRD SEM EDX FT IR XPS and BET surface area analysis to assess its physicochemical characteristics . Additionally basicity which has been observed as the most process governing factor was also evaluated through Hammett indicator benzoic acid titration method . The Sr Ti mixed metals oxide with 4 1 was observed with highest catalytic activity for methanolysis reaction . Its potency was facilitated by fairly acquired BET surface area 43.6m
346,This study evaluated the physicochemical and morphological properties of pectin and chitosan particles combined with sugarcane vinasse for soil fertilization applications . Particles were obtained by adding the biopolymeric solutions dropwise into the crosslinking solutions followed by drying . Vinasse enhanced pectin gel stability improving pectin vinasse particle properties . Physicochemical characterization indicated that vinasse nutrients were properly incorporated in both pectin and chitosan matrices . Particles showed spherical shape with an average diameter of 3 and 2mm for the pectin and chitosan particles with vinasse respectively . Chitosan particles compared to pectin showed lower swelling capacity and solubility and higher mechanical resistance indicating a denser and more compact polymer network . Both particles were able to hinder water evaporation rates from sandy soil under water stress conditions . Biobased particles with vinasse added show potential to be applied as soil fertilizer representing an alternative to use and disposal of this expressive wastewater from sugar and alcohol industries .
347,Catalytic conversion of xylose and the hemicellulose fraction of waste biomass to furfural is important for the valorization of waste lignocellulose . Here a clean and efficient catalytic system consisting of sulfonated carbon microspheres catalysts and valerolactone was developed for the upgrading of xylose and waste lignocellulose to the furfural in one pot . Sulfonated carbon microspheres C
348,Critical materials are vital to modern technology . Components of modern vehicles can be recycled to recover and reuse the CMs to help ensure a supply of these materials . Electronic components from a 2015 GMC Sierra truck and 2016 Toyota Camry sedan were analyzed for CMs . The components were processed via size reduction aqua regia leaching and dissolution and final solutions were analyzed for metal content . It was found that most electronic components of both vehicles contain CMs . The most concentrated CMs in the components were Sn Nb and Tb . Nd and Co were found in several of the magnetic components . CM economic value was found to be low compared to the overall value of the components and the CM content would not allow for a viable pathway for recycling . Remanufacturing of components may be a more economic option of reuse in the future .
349,This study investigates an image recognition system for the identification and classification of waste electrical and electronic equipment from photos . Its main purpose is to facilitate information exchange regarding the waste to be collected from individuals or from waste collection points thereby exploiting the wide acceptance and use of smartphones . To improve waste collection planning individuals would photograph the waste item and upload the image to the waste collection company server where it would be recognized and classified automatically . The proposed system can be operated on a server or through a mobile app . A novel method of classification and identification using neural networks is proposed for image analysis a deep learning convolutional neural network was applied to classify the type of e waste and a faster region based convolutional neural network was used to detect the category and size of the waste equipment in the images . The recognition and classification accuracy of the selected e waste categories ranged from 90 to 97 . After the size and category of the waste is automatically recognized and classified from the uploaded images e waste collection companies can prepare a collection plan by assigning a sufficient number of vehicles and payload capacity for a specific e waste project .
350,Currently resource efficiency is getting more importance due to a build up of disposed waste in landfills . The closed raw material cycle is an important topic in industries as it is economic and pollute free . This scenario applies to both existing and innovative future materials . To tackle the pollute emission of vehicles multimaterial and hybrid structures are gaining importance in lightweight construction . Hybrid structures that are a combination of metallic materials and carbon fibre reinforced plastics are often used for lightweight structures . In the present work a method is presented that can separate hybrid structures using thermal process so that they can be recycled separately . The thermal process was investigated with the help of different heating techniques such as the furnace induction resistance and infrared on the hybrid structures . Corresponding process windows and the boundary conditions for respective heating techniques are investigated in the current work . The influence of various heating techniques on the separation process is validated using microscopic results .
351,For sustainable growth an economic model must tend toward a circular system especially in the field of waste management . This work focuses on the valorization of spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst from oil refineries which generate 400 000 metric tons of spent catalyst per year worldwide most of which is sent to landfills . A new alternative to landfilling is proposed for this waste based on the combination of acid leaching for the recovery of lanthanum a valuable rare earth and the reuse of the leached solid residue as a cement substitute . A comparative life cycle assessment was made including four environmental impact categories i.e . global warming fossil resource scarcity mineral resource scarcity and water consumption in order to quantify the potential environmental benefits of secondary lanthanum recovery from industrial waste with respect to primary lanthanum extraction from mineral resources . A maximum of 85.6 La recovery was achieved and 15wt of cement can be substituted with leached solid residue without changing the original cement classification . The waste management process presented in this paper promotes the sustainable management of the spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst and contributes to the development of a new resource for a critical material such as lanthanum . The implementation of this novel waste management process could reduce global warming and mineral resource scarcity but would increase fossil resource scarcity and water consumption in comparison with primary La extraction .
352,In this work the hydrothermal coupling pyrolysis method was used to treat municipal solid waste incineration fly ash and municipal sewage sludge . The regulation of migration mechanism of heavy metals which included Cr Ni Cu Zn Cd and Pb were investigated including the conditional effects of hydrothermal pretreatment the pyrolysis temperature the pyrolysis time and the heating rate on the HM distribution . The results indicated that HTT as a pretreatment method achieved the redistribution and preliminary immobilization of the HMs decreasing the potential environmental risk level . After HTP the HMs were more immobilized and this effect was enhanced when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 300 to 800C . However Zn Cd and Pb evaporated under high temperature . Leaching experiments revealed that all the HMs in the pyro char from pyrolysis at 800C were below the standard . The influences of the HR and pyrolysis time on the HM immobilization were slight under a higher temperature . After HTP the HM environmental risk decreased to a low level . The physicochemical characteristics of the pyro char demonstrated that carbon trapping and chemical sedimentation played leading roles in the middle temperature range while mineral matrix encapsulation might have been dominant under high temperature .
353,The purpose of this study is to test alternative additives for trace element supplementation and process stabilization during anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge . Process instabilities due to acidification are a typical problem in waste fermentation . Provision with minerals and TE is crucial for microorganisms in AD to work effectively allowing higher organic loading rates within the digester without risking acid accumulation . In batch fermentation tests different mixture configurations of OFMSW digested sewage sludge and biomass ashes were evaluated . Based on an extensive characterization of the TE contained in wood ashes suitable combinations of digested sewage sludge and OFMSW as a baseline substrate together with ash additives were derived . While high dosages of ash reduced biogas production 1 1 mix of ash and OFMSW facilitated higher CH
354,Elevated boron concentrations above the regulatory standard were inadvertently discovered in downgradient groundwater monitoring wells at 22 construction and demolition debris landfills in Florida US . This created a unique opportunity to evaluate whether C D debris can be considered a plausible source of boron at unlined landfills . Approximately 1200 historical landfill leachate and groundwater records were surveyed from semi annual and annual monitoring reports covering a 9 year period . Laboratory leaching experiments were conducted on soils from each of these sites to determine if the source could have been boron mobilized from naturally occurring soils . Historical leachate quality data from lined landfills near four of the unlined C D debris landfills were examined to determine if leachate from the unlined landfills could be the boron source . The US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1312 or Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure and the EPA Method 1316 were performed on materials commonly found in C D debris to see if these products have the potential to leach appreciable levels of boron . The results of this work indicate leachate from unlined C D debris landfills as the most plausible source of elevated boron concentrations in downgradient monitoring wells .
355,Acidogenic fermentation of food waste for production of volatile fatty acids contributes to both food waste minimization and resource recovery . To gain knowledge on functional bacterial communities and facilitate continuous production of VFAs this research firstly studied the effects of initial pH values and temperatures on VFAs production distribution and bacterial communities during acidogenic fermentation of food waste . The optimal conditions were determined as pH 7 and 35C corresponding to the highest total VFAs yield of 11.8g COD L with major components of acetic propionic and butyric acid . Bioinformatic analysis showed that the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial classes e.g .
356,The effect of a biosurfactant rhamnolipid coupled with a thermal treatment was investigated to determine its impact on improving the deflocculation of dehydrated sludge from wastewater treatment processes . Results showed that the RL treatment positively impacted sludge conditioning to weak acidity and hydrolyzed the carbohydrates and proteins released from the matrix of the extracellular polymeric substance . When RL was coupled with high temperature thermal treatments soluble chemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand solubilization increased by 9.619.7 times and 13.429.3 respectively . The RL treatment reduced antibiotic resistant bacteria by 5.498.4 and antibiotic activity was further accelerated by high temperature thermal treatment . The combination of biosurfactant and thermal treatment can effectively deflocculate dehydrated sludge and should be considered an alternative technology for the sludge management process .
357,The scope of this research is to present a more holistic approach on measuring countries performance in managing and exploiting their Municipal Solid Waste . Specifically we argue that relying solely on criteria like the recycling and or the cyclical material use rate can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of countries true performance . That is because the level of waste generation is left unaccounted despite the fact that low waste generation is an important environmental target and so is the countries true potential as it is reflected by their economic and social progress .
358,Carbon based bimetallic electrocatalysts were obtained by catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics with Fe Ni based catalysts and were used as efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalysts in this study . The prepared iron nickel alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in oxidized carbon nanotubes are solid products with a unique structure . Moreover the chemical composition and structural features of FeNi OCNTs were determined . The iron nickel alloy nanoparticles were wrapped in carbon layers and the carbon nanotubes had an outer diameter of 2050nm and micron scale lengths . FeNi OCNT with a Fe Ni ratio of 1 2 exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance as an ORR catalyst with a positive onset potential of 1.01V and a half wave potential of 0.87V which were comparable to those of a commercial 20 Pt C catalyst . Furthermore FeNi OCNT12 exhibited promising longterm stability and higher tolerance to methanol than the commercial 20 Pt C catalyst in an alkaline medium . These properties were attributable to the protective OCNT coating of the iron nickel alloy nanoparticles .
359,This paper reports the preparation of newly synthesized bio epoxy monomers suitable for replacing petrochemical derived epoxy resins . An original green method able to produce epoxy monomers starting from neat carbohydrates waste flours and even from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was here proposed . Hence for the first time the epoxidation of carbohydrates was attained only through the exposition to UV and ozone radiation without using any organic solvent to carry out the reaction . Besides the innovation in the epoxidation method this work explored the possibility of valorizing waste materials by recycling carbohydrate scraps in particular the exposition of waste flours and municipal solid waste to UV and ozone and their consequent epoxidation allowed obtaining green precursors for the production of a bio based epoxy resin .
360,Novel and efficient drying method based on electromagnetic induction plate heating was used to treat sewage sludge . This work focused on the effects of EMI P action on heavy metals in dried SS . Surface functional groups surface chemistry and microstructures of SS treated were investigated and compared to provide insights into the transformation mechanisms of HMs during EMI P drying process . The results show that the EMI P dried SS showed undesirably total concentrations of Cd and Zn and leaching concentrations of HMs exceeded the Chinese ground water standard . Ni Zn and As in the EMI P dried SS still exhibited high mobility the leaching percent of Ni Zn and As can reach up to 28.56 10.36 26.96 26.61 and 30.64 23.14 respectively . Compared with conventional thermal drying the EMI P method can effectively reduce the eco toxicity derived from HMs by 28.06 under 500V condition . The stabilization effect of the EMI P action can be attributed to the following EMI P action promoted the generation of surface complexes with HMs HMs adsorption by silicate minerals was enhanced under high frequency magnetic fields and honeycomb structures of EMI P dried SS with micropores provided abundant active sites to bond with HMs .
361,The purpose of this discussion is to highlight the essential role that solid waste management must play in a humanitarian response towards disasters in particular the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic . We highlight a number of potential avenues for scholarly investigation into the waste impacts of our response to Covid 19 but in particular briefly unpacks the relationship between disasters consumption and disposability as one potential research topic . The discussion is intended to start a conversation that is at the moment critically relevant and to contribute to a more inclusive and less normatively Western waste management studies discourse .
362,This paper reports a complete characterisation of poultry litter ash and its potential use as a heavy metal stabiliser . We propose a novel approach in which the ashes deriving from municipal solid waste incineration are combined with poultry litter ash rather than with coal combustion flue gas desulfurisation residues . Heavy metals stabilisation was demonstrated by comparing the elemental concentrations in the leaching solutions of the starting raw and stabilised materials leachable Pb and Zn showed a reduced solubility . The characterisation was conducted by total reflection X ray fluorescence X ray diffraction micro Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X ray spectrometry . The results showed that the poultry litter ash was Ca P K and S rich . It contained amorphous materials 73 and fly ash cyclone 61 and soluble phases as well as resilient crystalline and amorphous phases . After two months the Pb and Zn concentrations in the leachate solutions were below the limit set by the European regulations for waste disposal . We propose a mechanism for the heavy metals stabilisation based on the carbonation process and high amounts of P Ca and reactive amorphous phases . In conclusion it is demonstrated that poultry litter ash can be an effective secondary source of heavy metals allowing their immobilisation through P and Ca based reactive amorphous phases .
363,Material efficiency measures such as recycling rates are often used to set circular economy targets to achieve higher resource efficiency and lower environmental impact . The aim of this study was to identify material efficiency indicators suitable to reflect the environmental performance of waste and recycling systems using PET bottle waste management in three European countries with diverse waste management structures and recycling performance levels . Material flow analysis and life cycle assessment were performed to assess the material efficiency and environmental impacts of each system as a basis to analyze the relation between these two dimensions . PET bottle waste generation was 5.4kg person and year in Austria in 2013 6.0kg pa in Germany in 2017 and 6.9kg pa in Serbia in 2015 . Out of this waste flow 41 91 and 11 were directed into PET recyclate in Austria Germany and Serbia respectively . For all systems higher material efficiency translated into lower environmental impact and vice versa . However linear regression analysis between different material efficiency indicators and environmental impacts showed that indicators targeted at actual recycling specifically at closed loop were better suited to reflect environmental performance than input based indicators . Therefore whenever data are available output based quality related indicators should be used to measure the material efficiency of waste and resource systems because they correlate best with the goals of increasing resource efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts .
364,Bitumen ages in the short and long term due to environmental conditions . As the bitumen ages it loses its original properties and flexibility . Hardened bitumen causes certain distresses in pavement that may endanger traffic safety and reduce travel comfort . Bitumen is one of recoverable material however some techniques may not be ecological due to considerable energy time and cost . On the other hand recovering of aged bitumen might be eco friendlier energy efficient and economic by using bio based waste materials such as waste vegetable cooking oils . In this perspective this paper was established on the idea of sustainable recovery of aged bitumen and WVCO . Base bitumen was aged in case of short term and long term in laboratory condition and modified with WVCO ranging from 2 to 10 by weight of bitumen . To determine the effect of WVCO modification on aged bitumen conventional and rheological test methods were utilized . To find the optimum rate of WVCO for full recovery of aged bitumen an index called Pure Rejuvenation Index was specified and applied for each test results . It can be concluded from PRI analyses that WVCO can be used as rejuvenator to recover aged bitumen and approximately 3 and 6 of WVCO are required for ST and LT aged bitumen cases respectively . However different test methods yield different optimum rates of WVCO for ST and LT aged bitumen . Recovering of WVCO and aged bitumen by using together may provide environmental protection and conservation of resources .
365,Circular Economy turned into one of the most popular topics worldwide for presenting itself as the solution to problems linked to the traditional take make consume dispose system . But how can CE be addressed as public policies worldwide While there are ambitious and committed strategies in the European Union and Asia the path that emerging economies are taking is poorly researched . Therefore we selected Colombia a Latin American country which is beginning to implement new public policies that are on par with global concerns . Furthermore its waste management panorama has been transformed in recent decades due to its legal framework restructuring differently than others in the region . This article aimed to elucidate which drivers have influenced the waste management policies in Colombia based on its historical context and how these drivers impacted Municipal Waste Management systems . Amongst the principal drivers identified we highlight financial sustainability and inclusive recycling which have allowed improvements towards a more sustainable waste management in the country . Moreover it was possible to understand how the current legal framework was structured and its future challenges . This study constitutes a knowledge base for scholars and policymakers from other emerging economies creating a potential to verify the relationship and antagonisms between waste management drivers and how they affect public policy implementation .
366,A shift is underway in China from perceiving municipal solid waste as a strictly environmental concern to identifying MSW as a resource . China exhibits a growing focus on using MSW in the energy sector while putting more emphasis on waste sorting and recycling in general and sorting food waste in particular . Timely planning of MSW treatment capacity requires reliable forecasts of future MSW quantities and their characteristics . This article uses econometric analysis to perform regional specific projections for collected MSW . Four scenarios are presented three of which include sorting of food waste from the mixed MSW stream and or capping mixed MSW generation . In the different scenarios aggregated on a national level mixed MSW ranges from 159 million metric tons to 340 MMT and sorted food waste from MSW from zero to 109 MMT in 2050 . Conclusions show that sorting of food waste will create stable levels of mixed MSW in many provinces and that there is a risk of overinvestments in MSW incineration capacity in most provinces .
367,Waste mobile phones contain significant amounts of valuable metals and non metallic materials . Consequently the extraction of valuable materials from discarded phones which is a more cost effective method compared with primary mining is an essential step for maximizing the recovery of secondary resources and minimizing e waste pollution . We designed a green and efficient path for recovering valuable metals from waste mobile phones and explored its technical feasibility from both environmental and economic perspectives through life cycle assessment and revenue expenditure model .
368,The purpose of this paper is to provide a full characterization of post consumer plastic film recovered from mixed municipal solid waste treatment plants in Spain . Currently this type of plastic waste is not recycled due to technical or economic barriers and is still sent to landfill . Different types of municipal plastic waste from manual and automated sorting were studied i colour plastic film recovered by ballistic separators and then manual sorting in different seasons ii colour plastic film recovered by automated sorting and iii white plastic film from primary manual sorting process . The samples were characterized by different techniques including the ultimate and proximate analysis Higher Heating Value and Lower Heating Value metal content Thermogravimetric Analysis and Derivative Thermogravimetry Fourier Transform Infrared analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry . The results were compared to those obtained for pretreated colour and white plastic film waste and contrasted with industrial recycled film granules of polyethylene . Additionally pretreated plastic film samples were also characterized by analyzing viscosity Pressure Volume Temperature diagram specific heat capacity and halogen and sulphur contents . Characterization data from this study will contribute to identify and develop potential recycling alternatives for a more sustainable municipal plastic waste management which is recognized as a priority in the European Circular Economy Action Plan to use resources in a more sustainable way .
369,The possibility of a pyrolysis process as a mean of recycling the residual plastic rich fraction derived from of a material recovery facility has been evaluated . The unknown product composition of WEEE residue has been supposed through coupled thermal infrared analysis and ultimate analysis and resulted as PP 3wt PBT 3wt PVC 4wt styrene based polymers 50wt thermosetting resins 24wt inorganic fraction 16wt . DSC experiments showed that the overall energy defined as the degradation heat needed in order to completely degrade WEEE residue was about 4 of the exploitable energy of the input material . The effect of temperature and different zeolite catalysts were investigated in particular in terms of yield and quality of the produced oils during the pyrolysis process . Produced oils were potentially exploitable as fuels and almost all catalysts improved their quality . The best performance was reached by NaUSY with the second highest production of light oil and the greatest total monoaromatics yield plus 12wt in comparison to thermal pyrolysis experiments . Furthermore light oil produced by NaUSY has one of the best LHV and no halogenated compounds were detected by GCMS analysis . Char or pyrolytic gas combustion could supply the energy required for the thermal degradation of WEEE Residue .
370,This research focused on the recovery of valuable materials from ferrous grinding swarf . We received the sample from the automobile industry . The sample has consisted of approximately 20wt moisture and 80wt residue . The chemical composition of the oven dried sample was approximately 87wt iron . In this study aqueous washing process for oil removal from ferrous grinding swarf was investigated with two different commercial reagents Micro 90 and Detergent 8 . Three different amounts of solids were mixed with 20mL of diluted reagents for the aqueous washing . In the Micro 90 solution about 80 of the oil was removed after three washing cycles at a solids content less than 3g 20mL . On the other hand when using Detergent 8 100 oil was removed after three washing cycles at a solids content of less than 3g 20mL . Pulp density was an important factor in determining oil removal efficiency . For the scale up experiment different washing methods such as ultrasonication and overhead stirrer were examined . The preliminary reuse test of the Detergent 8 solution was also conducted for the feasibility of the aqueous washing process .
371,Black soldier fly larvae treatment is an emerging technology for the conversion of biowaste into potentially more sustainable and marketable high value products according to circular economy principles . Unknown or variable performance for different biowastes is currently one challenge that prohibits the global technology up scaling . This study describes simulated midgut digestion for black soldier fly larvae to estimate biowaste conversion performance . Before simulation the unknown biowaste residence time in the three midgut regions was determined on three diets varying in protein and non fiber carbohydrate content . For the static
372,Selecting appropriate locations for municipal solid waste management facilities such as transfer stations is an important issue in rapidly developing regions . Multiple alternatives and evaluation attributes need to be analyzed for finalizing the locations of these facilities . Multi attribute decision making approaches are found to be very effective for ranking several potential locations and hence selecting the best among them based on the identified attributes . However conventional MADM approaches fail to find the rankings of alternatives derived from all possible combinations of these potential locations . Therefore this study presents a two stage MADM model that also accounts for all possible combinations of locations . This study evaluates economical environmental social and technical attributes based on realistic conditions of the study area
373,Volatile fatty acids are intermediates of anaerobic digestion with high value and wide range of usage . Co digestion of sewage sludge and external organic waste for VFA production can help achieve both resource recovery and ensure sustainable and innovative waste management . In view of this the effect of substrate proportions on VFA production from co digestion of primary sewage sludge and OW is studied . Long term operation in a semi continuous reactor was performed to assess the resilience of such a system and the VFA rich effluent was tested for its ability to be used as carbon source for denitrification . Co digestion was initially carried out in batch reactors with OW proportion of 0 25 50 75 100 in terms of COD and scaled up in a semi continuous reactor operation with 50 OW . In the short term operation in the batch mode acetic acid dominated however increasing OW fraction resulted in increased valeric and caproic acid production . Moreover in the long term semi continuous operation caproic acid dominated accounting for 55 of VFAs . The VFA rich effluent from the semi continuous reactor achieved the highest denitrification rate as a carbon source when compared with acetic acid and methanol . The results demonstrate that co fermentation can increase VFA yield and shift products from acetic acid to caproic acid in long term operation and the VFAs can be used within wastewater treatment plants to close the loop .
374,Typical used disposable nappies usually consist of nonwoven fabrics Super Absorbent Polymer and organic material namely fluffy pulp urine and or excreta . Currently this waste stream is being disposed to landfills causing many environmental issues . An alternative management method could be the valorisation of the biodegradable material through anaerobic digestion and the recycling of plastics and SAP . Pretreatment of nappies is mandatory to separate SAP and plastics from the organic material . The aim of this work was the development of a process to minimize SAPs volume as this component can swell up to 1500 times its own mass by water absorbance thus hindering any further biological process . CaCl
375,We analyze waste generation differences across Spanish regions by studying the evolution of two complementary indicators municipal solid waste per unit of GDP as well as in per capita terms . To that end we apply the recent statistic developed by Phillips and Sul which allows us to test for the null hypothesis of convergence . In the present case this hypothesis is equivalent to admitting that the waste generation follows a similar path across the Spanish regions . Our results lead us to reject this hypothesis which implies that Spanish regional waste generation is quite heterogenous and exhibits several patterns of behavior . We observe that the northern regions exhibit the lowest waste ratios while the insular and Mediterranean coast regions have the highest waste generation . This different behavior is also explained by some socioeconomic factors . Per capita income environmental spending and education level are helpful in this regard . The population dispersion and the number of years that a region has been governed by a left wing party are also associated with lower levels of waste generation . Finally we can also observe that the regions with the highest levels of waste generation are greatly dependent on the tourism industry . Then strategies targeting the transit towards a more sustainable economy in Spain should take into account this fact . In particular the adoption of methods for the reduction of the waste levels generated by tourism activities in these areas can be very useful .

377,Waste sorting is essential to address the current predicament of waste management . Though it is important insufficient attention has been paid to explore residents waste sorting intention and behavior and understand its formation process . To narrow the research gap this research built a theoretical research model by adding personal moral norms and waste sorting knowledge into the theory of planned behavior to explicate residents waste sorting intention and behavior formation process . Meanwhile given the discrepancy between waste sorting intention and actual behavior this research also explored the effect of external conditions such as incentive measures on this discrepancy . Based on survey data from 397 Chinese residents this research found that attitudes subjective norms perceived behavioral control personal moral norms and waste sorting knowledge were directly and significantly related to residents waste sorting intention . Waste sorting knowledge also had an indirect influence on residents waste sorting intention through attitudes and perceived behavioral control . Additionally this research corroborated the discrepancy between waste sorting intention and behavior and suggested that the link between intention and behavior was contingent on incentive measures . Incentive measures strengthened the effect of intention on behavior . This research is useful for understanding residents waste sorting intention and behavior and valuable for encouraging residents to sort waste in their daily lives .

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship among municipal waste generation greenhouse gas emissions and GDP in Switzerland over the period 19902017 . We apply both time series procedures and a Machine Learning approach . Empirical findings underline a bidirectional causal relationship between municipal solid waste generation and GDP indicating that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis holds for Switzerland . Moreover we found that waste recovery is a key driver in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions . In fact in the Tree Model the probability that a change in the waste recovery variable could lead to a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions registered a value of 87 .
380,The volume of end of life automotive batteries is increasing rapidly as a result of growing electric vehicle adoption . Most automotive lithium ion batteries are recycled but could be repurposed as second life batteries since they have 7080 residual capacity which can be adequate for stationary applications . SLBs have been proposed as potential inexpensive low carbon energy storage for residential and utility level applications with or without photovoltaics . However it is unknown whether SLBs will be better than new batteries and whether SLBs will provide similar cost and carbon emission reduction for the different stationary applications in all locations . This work compared the levelized cost of electricity and life cycle carbon emissions associated with using SLBs and new LIBs in the US for three energy storage applications residential energy storage with rooftop PV utility level PV firming and utility level peak shaving leading to a total of 41 scenarios . SLBs reduced the levelized cost of electricity by 1257 and carbon emissions by 731 compared to new LIBs in the considered applications with higher reductions for utility level applications . SLBs still provided benefits at the residential level when compared to rooftop PV alone by reducing the levelized cost by 1525 and carbon emissions by 2251 making SLBs attractive to residential consumers as well . SLBs offer an opportunity to utilize an end of life product for energy storage applications provided the uncertainty in SLB quality and availability is addressed .
381,Much attention has been devoted to disposing traditional sized poly waste by pyrolysis for methyl methacrylate . The pyrolysis of micron sized PMMA waste which may be different from that of traditional sized PMMA waste received little concern . The present study investigated the kinetics and volatile products of micron sized PMMA waste pyrolysis in inert atmosphere using thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared analysis . A global optimization algorithm namely Shuffled Complex Evolution was employed to simultaneously optimize the kinetic parameters . Results indicated that one shoulder and one peak occurred in the MLR variations with temperature . The values of the MLR at the shoulder and peak the average MLR all increased with the heating rate . The optimized kinetic parameters by SCE can be utilized to well reproduce the experimental thermogravimetric data . The values of activation energy and natural logarithm of pre exponential factor were in the range of 235.95248.61kJ mol and 16.9628.76min
382,Worldwide production of large volumes of dredged materials has become a pressing environmental problem . In Turkey the government has yet to develop management strategies that successfully prevent or minimize dumping into the Marmara Sea . One potential solution is the utilization of the DMs as a source of material for earthworks particularly in sanitary landfills in Istanbul and Kocaeli . The most economically developed cities in Turkey they were evaluated in terms of potential environmental impacts and regulatory compliance . Five ports harbors representing specific portions of the study area and different industrial activities were selected as pilot regions . Physical chemical mineralogical toxicological and leaching potential measurements of DMs dredged from the seabed revealed they qualify as non hazardous waste . Index and engineering tests performed on raw and processed DMs were assessed to determine the geotechnical requirements for soil based materials used in sanitary landfills . The results showed that non hazardous DMs could be utilized as a cover base cap liner and or fill material at various sections within the landfills . This method provides environmental advantages not seen with other management strategies for DMs such as dumping at sea or upland disposal .
383,In this paper the waste fried oil was used to remove the unburned carbon in coal fly ash during flotation process and found that the waste fried oil could be a novel collector for the removal of carbon from coal fly ash . The results implied that the wetting rate of the fly ash after treated by waste fried oil was decreased meanwhile the contact angle was increased . A significant decrease in wetting heat was observed which indicated a weaker interaction between deionized water and fly ash after treatment with waste fried oil . Flotation tests showed that the content of unburned carbon could be reduced effectively through froth flotation when took waste fried oil as collector . FTIR analysis testified that waste fried oil had abundant oxygen containing groups that could be adsorbed in a carbonaceous matter to achieve hydrophobization . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive analyses showed that the main compositions of flotation concentrate products were unburned carbon whereas the tailing products consist of aluminum and silicon which confirmed the superior separation performance when the waste fried oil was used as a collector in coal fly ash flotation . This investigation provides an approach to remove the unburned carbon in coal fly ash based on the principle of waste control through waste which can solve the environmental problems brought by large amounts of both coal fly ash and waste fried oils .
384,It is a fact that plastic packages are widely used over the world . This large scale consumption has resulted in a decrease of the initial resources used to manufacture the packages and has made it more of a challenge to dispose the increased amount of solid plastic wastes . Plastic waste is one of the most significant types of waste materials in the world owing to its non degradation and low biodegradability . The presence of large quantities of plastic waste has led to a number of environmental problems . Various researches have already been conducted to find a safe and environmentally friendly solution for the disposal of plastic wastes . Recently different types of plastic have been incorporated into concrete mixtures because of its long service life and lower weight in order to eliminate or reduce environmental problems . This paper presents an overview of previously published research papers which is investigating the use of different types of plastic wastes in concrete mixtures . In addition a global view is summarized regarding the effects of plastic waste on fresh mechanical thermal and acoustical properties of concrete .

Here we aim at advancing our fundamental understanding on the possibility for relatively unbiased yet affordable and practicable sub sampling benefiting from state of the art equipment theoretical calculations by the theory of sampling and implementation of best sub sampling practices . Solid recovered fuel was selected as a case of a solid waste sample with intermediate heterogeneity and chlorine as an analyte with intermediate variability amongst waste properties . ToS nomographs were constructed for different sample preparation scenarios presenting the trend of uncertainty during sub sampling . Nomographs showed that primary shredding final d
390,Current studies on the food energy water nexus do not capture effects on human health . This study presents a new methodology for assessing the environmental sustainability in the food energy water health nexus on a life cycle basis . The environmental impacts estimated through life cycle assessment are used to determine a total impact on the nexus by assigning each life cycle impact to one of the four nexus aspects . These are then normalised weighted and aggregated to rank the options for each aspect and determine an overall nexus impact . The outputs of the assessment are visualised in a nexus quadrilateral to enable structured and transparent interpretation of results . The methodology is illustrated by considering resource recovery from household food waste within the context of a circular economy . The impact on the nexus of four treatment options is quantified anaerobic digestion in vessel composting incineration and landfilling . Anaerobic digestion is environmentally the most sustainable option with the lowest overall impact on the nexus . Incineration is the second best option but has a greater impact on the health aspect than landfilling . Landfilling has the greatest influence on the water aspect and the second highest overall impact on the nexus . In vessel composting is the worst option overall despite being favoured over incineration and landfilling in circular economy waste hierarchies . This demonstrates that circular does not necessarily mean environmentally sustainable . The proposed methodology can be used to guide businesses and policy makers in interpreting a wide range of environmental impacts of products technologies and human activities within the food energy water health nexus .
391,Optimization of anaerobic digestion poses many practical constraints .

392,Olive mill solid waste is an abundant agricultural waste without viable solution . The effects of OMSW different pretreatments different additives and utilization of different saccharification enzymes were tested on saccharification process and sugar release and on fermentation inhibitors formation and ethanol production . Microwave treatment with formic acid resulted in highest saccharification rates and fermentation yields although loss of sugars and fermentation inhibitors production was notable . Microwave with water treatment resulted in less saccharification and ethanol . To facilitate economical process and to extract maximum value solid remnants after saccharification were tested as heavy metal sorbent . Microwave with water resulted in the best sorbent followed by microwave with formic acid . Addition of sulfuric acid to either microwave or autoclave resulted in very poor saccharification and absorbance capacity . Therefore combination of ethanol and sorbent production from OMSW are suggested .
393,A process for the valorization of citrus peel waste has been developed aiming to produce succinic acid and a series of added value products through the biorefinery platform . CPW was subject to physicochemical and biological treatment to isolate essential oils and pectin as extractable products pretreating the material for subsequent production of succinic acid that enabled application of remaining biorefinery residues as fertilizer substitute . Cellulose hemicellulose and lignin contents of CPW accounted for 22.45 8.05 and 0.66 respectively while acid hydrolysis reduced hemicellulose by 3.42 in BR . Moreover essential oils extracted from CPW included 17 compounds among which D limonene reached 96.7 . The hydrolyzate generated was fermented for succinic acid production using

395,This study provides Sri Lanka wide empirical evidence on trends and determinants of waste disposal mechanisms at household level over the past decade from 2007 to 2016 . The study uses the data of 60 820 households from three waves of the Sri Lanka income and expenditure survey and estimates a multinomial logistic regression model . The descriptive statistics show that though Sri Lankan households predominantly burn waste there is an emerging trend of shifting the main mechanism more towards waste collection arrangements .
396,This paper contributes to the knowledge on waste biomass conversion processes occurring in the presence of hot compressed water . The experimental procedure detailed herein assesses different process schemes based on the low temperature reaction known as hydrothermal carbonization . The performances of two lab scale reactor configurations with and without a downstream flash expansion step were evaluated and compared . Each setup was tested with six different types of waste biomass . Fir beech and olive prunings are representative of lignocellulosic raw materials while potato pea and carrot are representative of non lignocellulosic wastes from processing in the local agro food industry . The batch reactions were carried out for up to 120min . The hydrochars were characterized by elemental composition humidity heating value and mass and energy yields . The extent of difference between the results obtained for the two procedures varied significantly with the material treated . At a residence time of 30min the solid yields increased due to expansion ranging from 10 to 36 for lignocellulosic material and 50 to 220 for agro food industry scraps . The downstream flash expansion step causes an increase of the solid yields especially for hydrochars from lignocellulosic materials leading to higher energy recovered compared to the configuration without expansion . Lignocellulosic and agro food wastes behaved dissimilarly likely because of different hydrothermal reaction pathways . The additional expansion step can considerably increase the efficiency of energy recovery in full scale plants the extent of which depends on the biomass waste substrate used .
397,Horizontal spacing of horizontal extraction gas wells can be designed to achieve a 90 pumping rate of the total generated landfill gas from given waste properties cover characteristics and vacuum pressure . However cover characteristics and vacuum pressure are also important design parameters and different combinations of them result in different distributions of gas pressure in the waste some of which would induce problematic air intrusion while others might pose threat to cover stability . This paper uses the maximum gas pressure directly below cover to distinguish these combinations and provides the first study of the effects of the above parameters on potential outcomes . The ability of the overlying cover to resist LFG emission from the landfilled waste is suggested not to exceed a critical value otherwise the maximum gas pressure below it would become at least 1kPa larger than atmospheric pressure . A design formula for this critical value is proposed with respect to typical values of waste properties vacuum pressure and the buried depth of horizontal wells in wide ranges . Together with consideration of recovery efficiency the proposed method can be used to design a horizontal extraction gas collection system and a cover system in better working condition and to evaluate the maximum gas pressure below cover . These applications are illustrated by a worked example .
398,In the current scenario used paper cups are disposed of without any proper treatment thereby damaging the environment .

399,Waste management and recycling are fundamental issues for policy makers to protect the environment . Although these topics have been broadly studied at country level studies addressing sub national units are still limited . This research aims to contribute to this field by analyzing the waste generation and recycling processes across the Portuguese municipalities during the period 20092018 . The paper assesses the decoupling hypothesis consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve advocating that a threshold of development is reached and afterwards environmental degradation declines through less waste production and higher recycling rates . To address this hypothesis the waste generation and recycling equations are estimated using as fundamentals the total production activity and by sector the population age structure and population density as proxy for the degree of urbanization . This study also assesses whether the development dichotomy between more and less developed municipalities affects waste and recycling performances and to what extent the fiscal consolidation period influenced these processes . Empirical evidence validates the inverted U shaped relationship between municipal waste generation and overall production per head the U shaped relationship between recycling and waste generation as well as between recycling and the share of the tertiary sector . The municipal production structure is shown to be important for explaining waste generation and recycling behavior in contrast to population age structure that only differentiates recycling performance . It is also shown that the fiscal consolidation period affected positively the waste and recycling processes while population density and the development dichotomy are not relevant factors for explaining differences in waste generation and recycling activities across the Portuguese municipalities .
400,Flood waste management is important for reducing the damage and secondary environmental pollution caused by delays in disaster recovery . One key issue related to flood waste management concerns estimating the precise quantity of waste to plan recovery strategies and policies . In this study an advanced flood waste estimation technique was devised using data stratification . In total 90 flood cases in South Korea were sorted by three strata characteristics administrative region urbanization rate and disaster type and coastal accessibility . According to the results such data stratification led to flood waste prediction improvement not only by the single stage stratification but also by successive stratifications . Data stratification was effective both for identifying groups with similar contexts and for eliminating disparities in the dataset that impede accurate waste prediction . Among the stratification sequences tested the order resulted in the most improvement in flood waste prediction was UR AR and DC . This stratification order yielded enhanced waste prediction in 74 cases . Since this study deals with a strategy to resolve gaps in disaster data which is a crucial issue in many countries it is envisaged that this strategy can be transferred to other countries .
401,The European Union is aiming at a circular economy and increased resource efficiency which requires a waste management at the end of life of products . This is especially challenging for new and innovative products for which no recycling infrastructure exists so far . Wind power plants are such a product for which large amounts of waste are expected within the next years as more and more plants reach their end of life . Especially the end of life rotor blades of wind power plants pose challenges with regard to waste management since treatment options for the installed glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics are still in a development stage . Moreover material specific characteristics and technical aspects require separate treatment of these materials . To plan efficient treatment infrastructure detailed knowledge on future waste streams is required . Against this background this paper aims at estimating the mass of glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastic waste from rotor blades . To do so we derive material specific weight functions and material specific shares to calculate the amount of installed glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics in rotor blades . We apply normally distributed lifetimes to project the calculated installed masses into the future and account for uncertainties within a simulation study . The estimation model is applied to a dataset of wind power plants within the European Union . Based on the considered dataset we estimate that 570 of fiber reinforced plastic waste will occur between 2020 and 2030 in the European Union of which 18 are carbon fiber reinforced plastic waste .
402,Nowadays municipal solid waste has become a vital part of the economy both as an output of human activities and as an input in the economy through material or energy recovery . Education has been shown to be closely related to the amount of MSW generated . The present research uses panel data obtained for 25 world counties for the years 19952016 and the examined variables include MSW Gross Domestic Product and education level . Through econometric methods the present paper accounts for the presence of cross section dependence and uses appropriate panel unit root tests to discover feasible cointegrated relationships . Also it strongly accounts for the interdependence between MSW economic growth and education level . Based on these the validity of the Waste Kuznets Curve hypothesis is redefined . Specifically an inverted U shape relationship is observed both in the static and dynamic analyses for MSW . The calculated turning points although quite high they are in all cases within the sample . In all specifications the sign of education level is negative as expected . Therefore it is shown that education can act as an effective tool to enhance pro environmental behaviour leading in turn to lower MSW arisings .

407,Municipal solid waste management is an important but complex logistical problem . The deployment of MSW management systems is hindered by the ever growing generation of waste and the often insufficient infrastructure to manage process and dispose of waste . This paper presents a coordinated framework for complex MSW management systems . The framework accommodates multiple key stakeholders in MSW systems such as suppliers of waste consumers of waste and derived products and providers of transportation and processing services . Here the stakeholders submit bids to a coordinator that solves an optimization problem to determine allocations and clearing prices that maximize the collective profit for all stakeholders and that balance supply and demand for waste and products . Furthermore the clearing process guarantees that the individual profits are non negative . Notably the framework operates as a competitive market that accelerates transactions between stakeholders and that handles complex logistical constraints that would be difficult to handle in peer to peer transactions . The framework also facilitates the integration of policy incentives and the monetization of environmental impacts . In this regard we evaluate a tax applied to open dump disposal . To illustrate the applicability an MSW system in Mexico was analyzed as a case study . Results reveal that taxation can be used to incentivize the provision of services for all stakeholders . Specifically we found that an appropriate tax can completely avoid disposal in open dumps . A tax of 5.1 USD tonne was identified as the minimum penalization that avoids diverting waste to open dumps .
408,Recycling of spent lithium ion batteries has drawn considerable attention in recent years as an economic solution to the resource shortage .

409,The concept of biorefinery expands the possibilities to extract value from organic matter in form of either bespoke crops or organic waste . The viability of biorefinery schemes depends on the recovery of higher value chemicals with potential for a wide distribution and an untapped marketability . The feasibility of biorefining organic waste is enhanced by the fact that the biorefinery will typically receive a waste management fee for accepting organic waste . The development and implementation of waste biorefinery concepts can open up a wide array of possibilities to shift waste management towards higher sustainability . However barriers encompassing environmental technical economic logistic social and legislative aspects need to be overcome . For instance waste biorefineries are likely to be complex systems due to the variability heterogeneity and low purity of waste materials as opposed to dedicated biomasses . This article discusses the drivers that can make the biorefinery concept applicable to waste management and the possibilities for its development to full scale . Technological strategic and market constraints affect the successful implementations of these systems . Fluctuations in waste characteristics the level of contamination in the organic waste fraction the proximity of the organic waste resource the markets for the biorefinery products the potential for integration with other industrial processes and disposal of final residues are all critical aspects requiring detailed analysis . Furthermore interventions from policy makers are necessary to foster sustainable bio based solutions for waste management .
410,The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of removal of difficult to biodegrade organic compounds from real stabilized landfill leachate with a membrane process alone and in combination with powdered activated carbon adsorption . For filtration ceramic membranes were used . The characteristics of the raw leachate were 788mg COD L and color of 0.4458cm
411,Reducing food waste is necessary for achieving healthy diets and sustainable food systems due to its negative impacts on resource conservation food security and environmental social and economic costs . This paper aim is to quantify the amount and types of food that is wasted by the consumers in different restaurant configurations . The second aim is to understand the reasons which lead them to waste food and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the waste . To fulfil the aims a mixed methodology was used including primary data collection in restaurants for the quantification of food waste interviewing consumers and staff along with calculating the environmental impact from the waste using life cycle assessment . The results show that different incentives and levels of interaction in consumers choice of food types exert influence on plate food waste . When incentive and interaction are low the amount of food waste is larger . It is the case of a la carte restaurants . The best performance in the restaurant categories was when both incentive and level of interaction were higher . Buffet where the consumers pay by weight therefore is the configuration that generates less food waste on the consumer s plate . The main wasted products are rice and beans followed by beef and then other carbohydrates . The life cycle assessment indicated a carbon footprint varying from 128 to 324g CO
412,Life Cycle Assessment is a widespread tool used to guide decision makers towards optimal strategic choices for sustainable growth . A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects . Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1 1 substitution ratio between similar materials products this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary . The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients . In this perspective the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste . In total sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials based on state of the art and presented case studies . The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies . The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities .
413,Due to the growing concerns about the increasing release of consumer products to the environment especially for defective electronic products the management of the closed loop supply chain is emerging . To do this a chain consisting of a manufacturer a retailer and a collector is offered in a manufacturer led Stackelberg game . Due to the presenting of some concepts in the model which are provided by considering two categories of customers for primary and secondary goods it is suitable for electronics supply chains . In order to coordinate between the members of the chain a hierarchical revenue sharing contract is introduced which is suitable for some members of the chain where operate as a holding company . In the following some numerical examples are applied to examine the applicability of the proposed models . The results of the sensitivity analysis on the main parameters of the problem indicate an increase in the profitability of all members in the coordination contract compared to the decentralized mode . Furthermore customer sensitivity to price and quality has also inverse and direct impact to members profitability respectively . Each of the analyzes provides some in depth managerial implications that can be considered for future research . Finally another research result will explain the increase in the amount of return defective goods by the customer in the contract mode .
414,Municipalities have been facing problems to keep the management of their municipal solid waste in financial balance . Increasing public awareness stricter legislation and large generation of MSW have led to high costs concerning related services . Therefore cities are starting to charge their citizens for the services provision and methods utilized vary significantly . They can range from a flat rate to the so named pay as you throw a proportional system in which the total amount varies according to the waste generated individually . In a scenario of little information regarding charging systems this research consulted academic material official websites and documents of the studied countries as well as national legislation in order to learn how countries with different characteristics charge their citizens for MSW management . It was observed a great variation in charging systems and prices usually the more developed a country is the more sophisticated it is in terms of charging schemes . Developed countries are ahead in terms of not only charging systems existence but also their type with a larger PAYT presence throughout their territories . Developing countries on the other hand still do not charge and or are struggling to universalize the charging since most municipalities still finance the service through general taxes . When utilized the charging method usually chosen is the flat rate for its simplicity of calculation and understanding . For improvements in charging systems it is necessary not only the presence of a legal framework but most importantly a greater maturity regarding SW management .
415,Despite the growing interest of the automotive industry in using recycled polymers their undesired odor is limiting their application in vehicles interior components . To get deeper insights into its causes this study aimed at characterizing the odor of post consumer and recycled automotive polypropylene with different contents of talc and an anti fogging additive . Samples were evaluated by different sensory methods currently applied by the automotive industry which confirmed that they are not feasible for reuse in interior automotive applications . As these odor evaluations are usually performed by non trained panelists and do not allow a detailed description of the samples single odor qualities sensory evaluation according to ISO 13299 was performed by trained panelists . Samples showed mediumhigh odor intensities rated from 5.1 to 5.6 and a general dislike of the odor with hedonic ratings from 1.8 to 2.6 . Their odor profiles correlated well with the odorants identified by chemo analytical characterization using gas chromatographyolfactometry and two dimensional GC O coupled with mass spectrometry . An array of odorants with benzene and phenolic structures were identified as potential contributors to the samples overall smell and are likely to originate from degradation of additives commonly used in automotive components . While the addition of talc or anti fogging additive did not significantly improve the odor of the samples the description of the samples smell and the identification of odor active compounds related to it allow the development of avoidance strategies for the manufacturing of neutral smelling products intended for vehicles interior applications .
416,Technology for the transformation of waste feathers to quality regenerated filaments has been developed . Regardless of superior properties of natural keratin materials previously developed regenerated materials from keratin had tensile properties much lower than their natural counterparts due to backbone hydrolysis and inefficient reconstruction of disulfide crosslinkages . In this work tough keratin filaments have been regenerated from white duck feathers via efficient restoration of disulfide crosslinkages using a dithiol reducing agent . Dithiol substantially reserves free thiol groups in the extraction and formed lengthy intermolecular crosslinkages in regenerated keratin filaments . Due to the high degree of intermolecular reconstruction of disulfide bonds and formation of lengthy crosslinkages via dithiol chain extension the keratin filaments exhibited considerable improvements in mechanical properties especially for ductility and water stability . The tenacity and elongation at break were 160.7MPa and 14 respectively . The filaments retained about 80 of the tenacity of natural feathers at either dry or wet conditions and demonstrated stretchability 150 higher than natural feathers . The fiber regeneration technology makes it possible to substitute primary fiber sources by renewable poultry feathers . Successful filament substitution or addition can bring more than 88 billion dollar revenue . The technology not only contributes to a sustainable fiber and poultry industry but adds substantial values to poultry feathers .
417,Safe disposal of the sludge generated from sewage treatment plant is a major challenge worldwide . Hydrothermal carbonization is considered a potential pretreatment alternative for sewage sludge to facilitate the improved resource recovery . In the present study the mixed centrifuged sewage sludge was subjected to the HTC pretreatment to determine characteristics of the solid hydrochar and liquid fraction with a purpose of energy recovery and extraction of value added compounds respectively . HTC was performed in a high pressure batch reactor at 200C temperature for 18h duration . The HC produced after HTC resembled with the low quality peat coal whereas the LF contained value added chemicals such as humic acid and phosphate phosphorous PO
418,This study proposes a design of a household waste collection system based on a two stage procedure . First the bin location allocation problem is solved by selecting collection sites from a set of potential sites and determining the type and number of bins at each selected collection site . Second bin to bin waste collection routes are obtained for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that are restricted by either work shift duration or vehicle capacity . Mixed integer linear programming models are proposed for both stages considering the particular characteristics of the problem . The models are applied to a real world instance in the commune of Renca in Santiago Chile . The results of first stage indicate an important preference for small bins since they have a lower unitary cost . Due to the large size of the real instance a Large Neighborhood Search heuristic is used in the second stage to find good feasible vehicle routing solutions in a reasonable period of time . The results for the routing phase suggest a larger number of routes in the morning work shift since these routes have shorter distances . The LNS heuristic presents a satisfactory behavior when compared to the MILP model with small instances . The proposed bin to bin household waste collection vehicle routing presents a more efficient solution than the existing door to door waste collection in the commune of Renca with respect to the total daily traveled distance and the average work shift duration . Finally a sensitivity analysis is presented and discussed for both models .
419,Controversies on food delivery services environmental impacts have been sparked due to the growth of this economic sector . This study focuses on the environmental impacts generated by packaging waste related to urban food delivery services . In particular the Python based web crawling and sample survey methods are used for big data mining and LCA based environmental impacts evaluation and Kernel density analysis methods are combined to determine the positioning trend of food delivery service providers and expansion direction of environmental pollution load in Jing Jin Ji region . Results indicate that food delivery service packages presently account for a very small proportion of municipal solid waste . However this study also evidences that food packaging accounts for 15.7 of the total MSW generated in this region . Even if this growing market sector might have a relatively low impact households lifestyle might affect the results . In terms of consumption quantity plastic bags are the most used packages accounting for 35.08 wooden chopsticks account for 32.21 and plastic boxes account for 27.43 . Among all environmental impact categories resulting from the process of production of packages greenhouse effect is the most distinct one . Paper boxes generate the most serious environmental pollution . The distribution of environmental pollution loads resulting from food delivery service packages positively correlates with the distribution of food delivery service providers in Jing Jin Ji . Shijiazhuang has the highest degree of pollution resulting from food delivery service packages with the interrupt value ratio of 80 followed by Baoding City and Chengde City which have the interrupt value ratios of 65.1 and 48.6 respectively . Finally as bridges between food delivery service providers and consumers food delivery service platforms should improve their environmental protection mechanisms . Meanwhile the government should define a standard concerning food delivery service packages to consolidate the concept of environmental protection in the society to change the ways people consume in order to achieve a harmonious co existence between resource utilization and environmental protection .
420,In recent years a growing number of investigations have examined food waste in the food service sector in which the catering of individual events received little attention . We aimed to contribute to fill this knowledge gap by presenting insights from a case study based on data from 239 event caterings . The case study presents findings about the influences of four variables namely event type season event size and menu prices on buffet leftovers . We used a waste tracking system that allowed kitchen staff to quantify buffet leftovers for 4years from the beginning of 2014 until the end of 2017 . Among the studied variables the event size demonstrated the strongest influence on the generation of buffet leftovers in the case study . Buffet leftovers showed a trend of decreasing quantities relative to the number of guests for increasing event sizes . For instance smaller events with less than 100 participants recorded the highest quantities of approximately 280g of buffet leftovers per guest and larger events of more than 500 participants recorded the lowest quantities of approximately 74g per guest . In addition we found that three food product groups
421,Platinum group metals have gained significant interest due to their unique characteristics which make them the main constituents in advanced applications . In this work we introduce new pH dependent optical mesocaptors for the colorimetric monitoring and separation of Au from E waste leach liquors without a preconcentration process . The mesoporous silica nanospheres are fabricated via simple reproducible and low cost procedures . The optical mesocaptor is designed via indirect immobilization of thiazole yellow G and amacid yellow M chromogenic probes onto mesoporous nanostructured scaffolds . The silanol groups in the mesopores of silica surface robustly anchored dilauryl dimethyl ammonium bromide linker to induce the interactions with the TYG and AYM chelates thereby leading to the fashioning of a stable optical mesocaptors without releasing of the chelates throughout adsorption and sensing assays . The finding provides evidence of the capability of the synthesized decorated new nanostructured sensor shows excellent sensitivity toward Au with a limit of detection as low as 1.16g L

423,Despite pressing attention on construction waste management issues low rates of construction waste reuse and recycling remain a limitation in construction projects . In recent years Building Information Modeling has gained momentum for CWM purposes its data richness visualization and simulation capabilities provide an opportunity to enhance CW R R planning at the project level . In this context this study proposes temporal based algorithms integrated with 4D BIM for the planning of concrete and drywall waste R R throughout construction projects . Two case studies from Central Texas were used for the demonstration of the algorithms and estimates were validated with ground truth data and literature values from different projects in North America . The overarching objective of the proposed algorithms is to streamline estimation and visual planning of CW for on site reuse and off site recycling therefore promoting a more proactive and schedule based CWM plan . In addition the approach improves team communication around CWM goals of the project . Moreover through the use of 4D BIM on site waste reuse opportunities are planned in advance thus improving resource recovery and minimizing waste disposal in landfills .
424,Investigations of stabilized solidified sediment by simulated field construction processes are fundamental to evaluating the potential reuse as fill materials . A series of tests were conducted on the samples prepared from S S sediment grains which was obtained by crushing the cement treated sediment . By sampling the SG with different field curing durations and measuring them by unconfined compressive strength tests the effect of t1 on the UCS was investigated . By continually curing the samples prepared from the SG with 28 field curing days in laboratory for an additional 7 28 35 and 70days and subjecting them to UCS and tank leaching tests with different ambient pH values the effect of t2 and ambient pH was evaluated . Increasing t1 and t2 was found to significantly influence the strength of SG which highlights the importance of an appropriate curing period . The releases of the metals in the SG exhibited a strongly pH dependence but less correlation with t2 . Neutral conditions offered the best immobilization capacity for Cu As Cr Ni and Zn exhibited the lowest release at pH 10 the release of Pb decreased moderately with increasing pH . The S S sediment complied with the acceptance criteria in terms of metal release and can be regarded as an environmentally friendly fill material . The results highlight the technical feasibility of stabilized sediment recycling in aquatic environment projects .
425,The increase in non separated solid waste is a threat to environmental health . People may be motivated to reduce the destructive effects of waste accumulation in the environment by receiving educational messages and learning the proper methods of waste separation . This study aimed to determine the effect of educational messages on waste separation in dormitory students based on Extended Parallel Process Model . This randomized controlled trial was performed on 320 students categorized into four groups from October to December 2019 . After installing waste separation tags on separate containers three types of messages were presented to encourage and educate waste separation in the following four groups threat messages efficacy messages threat efficacy messages and control group . Data were collected prior to and one week after training by a self reported valid and reliable questionnaire . They were analyzed in SPSS21 . In the efficacy group and threat efficacy group not only the mean scores of perceived threat associated with non segregation and waste accumulation attitude and intention but also the mean score of efficacy and waste separation behavior were improved . In both groups the mean score of perceived barriers for waste separation was lower than the other two groups . Use of efficacy based massages alone or in combination with the threat component was proposed to promote waste separation . No specific study has documented the effectiveness of messages based on EPPM on solid waste separation behaviors . The current study highlighted the effectiveness of using EPPM to promote waste separation behavior in practice not in theory .
426,This paper presents an inventory of sewage sludge ashes generated in the mono incineration plants for municipal sewage sludge in Poland . This research focused on the detailed study of mass flows chemical composition and phosphorus recovery potential . There are currently 11 sludge mono incineration plants operated with a total capacity of 160 300Mg dry weight of sludge annually . Recently a significant increase in the amount of SSA generated in these plants has been observed reaching 26 756Mg in 2018 . Chemical composition of SSA showed significant amounts of the main nutrients calcium phosphorus magnesium and potassium . Additional main elements were iron silicon and aluminium . The main trace elements in the SSA were zinc and copper . Pollutants according to fertilizer regulations of different countries present in Polish SSA were chromium nickel lead and cadmium . The radionuclides uranium and thorium often present in higher amounts in commercial phosphate rock based fertilizers were only detected in SSA at low levels of 49mg kg and 23mg kg respectively . Theoretical phosphorus recovery potential from the SSA was estimated at 1613.8Mg of which 33.9 is bioavailable . Currently in Poland the recommended approach is the production of fertilizers as a result of the extraction of phosphorus from the SSA with its use in the production of secondary mineral fertilizers . Further research in this area is required considering Polish conditions and legislation .
427,Bread waste represents a significant part of food waste in Sweden . At the same time the return system established between bakeries and retailers enables a flow of bread waste that is not contaminated with other food waste products . This provides an opportunity for alternative valorisation and waste management options in addition to the most common municipal waste treatment namely anaerobic digestion and incineration . An attributional life cycle assessment of the management of 1kg of surplus bread was conducted to assess the relative environmental impacts of alternative and existing waste management options . Eighteen impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe methodology . The different management options that were investigated for the surplus bread are donation use as animal feed beer production ethanol production anaerobic digestion and incineration . These results are also compared to reducing the production of bread by the amount of surplus bread . The results support a waste hierarchy where reduction at the source has the highest environmental savings followed by use of surplus bread as animal feed donation for beer production and for ethanol production . Anaerobic digestion and incineration offer the lowest environmental savings particularly in a low impact energy system . The results suggests that Sweden can make use of the established return system to implement environmentally preferred options for the management of surplus bread .
428,Tire scrap is a solid waste that can be potentially used as the feedstock for the production of liquid fuels via the thermochemical process such as catalytic pyrolysis . Nevertheless it remains challenging to develop the efficient while cost effective catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of tire . In this study the pyrolysis of tire scrap at 500C with the biochar produced from the gasification of poplar wood at 850C were conducted . The biochar catalyst significantly affected the evolution of the volatiles and the char properties while had a slight impact on the yields of the gas tar and char products . The biochar catalyst catalyzes the cracking of limonene a major liquid product in tar to form significantly more propane in gases and alkanes or alkenes in the tar . In addition the interaction between the biochar with the oxygen containing organics promoted the re condensation reaction which increased the oxygen content in the char but the biochar catalyst did not influence the evolution of the aromatics . Additionally the catalytic pyrolysis also makes the biochar catalyst more oxygen deficient and more resistant towards oxidation . Concluding all the results showed that biochar which were produced from the gasification of poplar wood can be a potential catalyst for the pyrolysis of tire .
429,We present rapid and efficient identification of ten different types of post consumer plastics obtained from a local recycling unit by deploying a low cost compact CCD spectrometer in laser induced breakdown spectroscopy technique . For this investigation spectral emissions were collected by an Echelle spectrograph equipped with an intensified charge coupled device as well as a non gated Czerny Turner CCD spectrometer . The performance is evaluated by interrogating the samples in a single shot as well as accumulation mode . The results from principal component analysis have shown excellent discrimination . Further the artificial neural network analysis has demonstrated that individual identification accuracies rates up to 99 can be achieved . The data acquired with ES ICCD in the accumulation of ten shots have shown average identification accuracies 97 . Nevertheless similar performance is achieved with the NCT CCD spectrometer even in a single shot acquisition which reduces the overall analysis time by a factor of 15 times compared to the ES ICCD . Furthermore the detector collection system size weight and cost also can be reduced by 10 times by employing a NCT CCD spectrometer . The results have the potential in realizing a compact and low cost LIBS system for the rapid identification of plastics with higher accuracies for the real time application .

432,In recent years anaerobic digestion of organic waste is rapidly appearing as a winning waste management strategy by producing energy and anaerobic digestates that can be used as fertilizers in agricultural soils . In this context the management of the OW treatment process to maximize agro system sustainability satisfying the crop nutrient demands represents the main goal . To investigate these traits two protocols to assess the plant availability of digestate nitrogen and phosphorus were evaluated . With this aim the N and P availability was determined on 8 digestates and 2 types of digestate based compost from different OW via sequential chemical extractions . In addition the digestates were tested in soil incubations and in plant pot tests with Italian ryegrass and compared with chemical fertilizer and a non amended control soil . The N extracted from digestates via SCE was related to soil N mineralization and plant N recovery . The C N ratio had negative impact on mineralized N and its recovery in shoots Shoots
433,Integrated gasification combined cycle is a highly efficient method for producing electricity but discharges a byproduct in the form of a glassy slag similar to other electricity generation operations . Several technologies for recycling IGCC slag have been developed thus far although the results obtained are not promising or universally applicable . We quantitatively characterized an IGCC slag by using various testing methods including an automated scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry system to recognize its potential for recycling . The IGCC slag did not contain free CaO and the absence of free lime would address a concern of volumetric expansion during hydration . Automated SEM EDS analysis revealed that approximately 98 of the IGCC slag particles consisted of calcium rich aluminosilicate materials . Obvious differences in the concentrations of Si Al and Ca between the amorphous phases and the average chemical bulk were recognized . The chemical composition of the amorphous Si Al Ca phases was similar to that of Class C fly ash while the average bulk composition of the IGCC slag was in between that of Class C and Class F fly ashes . Considering this discrepancy understanding the dissolution mechanism of the reactive amorphous fraction as well as an exact assessment of the reaction products based on the role of Ca in alkali activated materials provides a new approach for the valorization of IGCC slag .
434,Chinas automobile industry is developing rapidly but the recycling rate of end of life vehicles has been low . In 2018 the recovery rate of end of life passenger vehicles was less than 18 of the scrapped amount . Dynamic material flow analysis can predict the amount of end of life passenger cars in China in the future and analyze the flow of materials in recycling system . Life cycle assessment can be used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions . Therefore this paper integrates these two methods into the model construction of recycling decision system . Meanwhile sensitivity analysis of the important factors affecting the efficiency of the recovery system is carried out . Finally the main recovery indexes of the system are predicted under three scenarios low speed medium speed and high speed development which are set based on scrap volume standard recovery rate proportion of assembly into remanufacturing and carbon tax price . The research results show that in 2018 656.9kg vehicle of iron 150.2kg vehicle of aluminum and 7.9kg vehicle of copper are recovered from end of life passenger car in China and the carbon emission during the recovery process is 651.1kg of CO
435,Hydrothermal treatment for dairy manure into value added hydrochar and bio oil is a potential technology for its resource utilization . During the process of treatment extractant is applied to the separation of hydrochar and bio oil . In this study three polar extractants and two nonpolar extractants were used and the physico chemical properties of hydrochar and the composition of bio oil were investigated . Compared with nonpolar extractants polar extractants could extract the bio oil absorbed on the hydrochar exterior and interior surface resulting in more mass loss of hydrochar and better extraction performance on the production of bio oil . The decrease of H C atomic ratio and the increase of O C atomic ratio indicated the demethanation tendency to occur during the extraction process and enhanced the hydrochar stability . The scanning electron microscope and specific surface area analysis revealed that polar extractant had a more positive effect than nonpolar extractant on the occurrence of disperse spherical microparticles and the augment of hydrochar specific surface area . The bio oil from polar extractant mainly consisted of N containing compounds ketones phenols and acids while the bio oil from nonpolar extractant mainly consisted of esters alkanes and aromatics . These results reveal that the hydrochar extracted by polar solvent exerts a greater potential for the production of carbon based material .

438,Steel slags are generally alkaline with a high calcium content and are viewed as a potential feedstock for carbon dioxide sequestration and utilization mostly through aqueous mineral carbonation routes . For recovery of multiple metals such as Ca Fe Mg and Si and generation of value added products by dissolution and precipitation reactions in aqueous media enhancing the metal selectivity and extraction efficiency are important . However there is limited understanding of independent parameters that influence these important characteristics . In this work a systematic attempt was made to correlate these key dissolution characteristics of basic oxygen furnace slag in acidic media with its mineralogical and physical characteristics the changes in aqueous chemistry and the role of potential secondary precipitates . The findings from this study substantiate that steel slag is a potential feedstock because of the calcium being mainly present as orthosilicates which were found to leach congruently without forming a leached layer that might hinder calcium extraction . The leaching of Fe from the slag is the main source of impurity and its slow oxidation precipitation leads to a pH plateau at the end of the dissolution step . Oxidation precipitation of Fe is controlled by hydroxyl concentration in the aqueous solution which necessitates a pH swing step by addition of a base after dissolution . Use of surface complexing agents such as sodium molybdate can significantly reduce iron impurity in the leachate and obtain an iron rich slag residue for recycle to iron and steel industry .
439,The Quebec residual materials management policy implies the banning of organic waste disposal or incineration from 2022 onwards . This policy also applies to domestic ship generated organic waste . However little is known about the current state of ship generated organic waste management in the province of Quebec . This study aims to analyse the current situation and propose sustainable strategies for ship generated organic waste valorisation in Quebec . Using the available data it was attempted to estimate ship generated waste quantities in Quebec after which the current practices of domestic ship generated organic waste management in Quebec and Europe were inventoried along with international waste management practices . Five waste valorisation scenarios were then proposed and compared in terms of advantages and disadvantages required equipment and associated costs and revenues . It involves 1 composting on board of the ship 2 centralised composting 3 composting at the port 4 centralised biomethanation and 5 biomethanation at the port . The current available data on ship generated waste quantities in Quebec did however not allow selecting an optimal scenario . The information provided in this short communication can serve as a valuable basis to guide future research efforts and decision making in this regard . Furthermore the current management of international waste was found to be complex and costly although biomethanation of such waste could offer a suitable and more sustainable solution . Finally it was concluded that a good cooperation between ships and ports is crucial to the implementation of any sustainable waste valorisation strategy .
440,Landfill simulation experiments were run at lab scale to compare the effects of intermittent and continuous aeration on the evolution of leachate composition and biogas production . The experiments were carried out using six reactors two of them under continuous aeration two under intermitted aeration and two anaerobic as a control . Different aeration regimes produced different effects on reactors . As expected carbon discharge via biogas was higher in reactors under continuous aeration than under intermittent aeration . The evolution of leachate quality was affected by the aeration regimes however at test end very similar concentration were ascertained for relevant leachate parameters in all aerated reactors .

442,Fast pyrolysis offers a promising efficient way for the resourceful disposal of waste tires and heating rate was a key influence factor on products properties . However the heating rates of the widely used experimental apparatus were generally outside the scope of most fast pyrolysis devices . To better guide actual pyrolysis process the present study focused on the effects of high heating rates on products distribution and sulfur transformation during waste tires pyrolysis . And experiments were conducted at temperatures from 425C to 575C by using a self designed photothermal reactor . The results showed that increasing heating rates posed slight effect on the products yields at 425C while obviously decreased char yield by forming more gases at higher temperatures . Moreover high heating rates promoted the fast cracking of tires to form more radical fragments leading to the formation of numerous small molecule H
443,To study the effects of different ash organics and C H O ratios on bio fuel characteristics and energy efficiency four kinds of sludge with different properties were used for microwave pyrolysis . Moreover the microwave pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of different sludge were also explored . The results showed that high ash sludge could accelerate the frequency of polar molecule rotation in the microwave field due to the presence of oxides with dielectric properties in ash thereby achieving faster heating rates and higher temperatures . However compared with high organic sludge high ash sludge exhibited lower bio gas yield and higher bio char yield . As the H C ratio increased from 0.127 to 0.148 the bio gas yield increased from 15.41 to 40.01 and the content of H

In order to reach the requirements of the Brazilian National Solid Waste Policy it is necessary to know which factors interfere in the performance of MSWC programs and WPOs to understand the relationships between these factors . The objective of this paper was to evaluate the sustainability of MSWC programs and WPOs in the State of Esprito Santo Brazil and propose a new methodological strategy . For data collection questionnaires were given to municipal civil workers from 24 municipalities and managers of 23 WPOs to calculate sustainability indicators and their correlations . Means and frequencies were calculated to analyze indicators in relation to sustainability peer to peer correlation analyses were performed to the construct graphs that obtained correlation coefficients which were applied to study the normality distribution . For each indicator we provided necessary investments to practical solutions . As a result a methodological proposal was presented to improve their actions which was hierarchized by degrees of temporal urgency for their implementation . The design of the actions has great potential to improve and develop sustainability practices in WPOs and MSWC programs . Due to the low quality of primary data collected we recommend the creation of the data control systems to continuously monitor .

Bones were collected from various fish species and processed for batch experiments . A commercial apatite product was also obtained for a comparative analysis . The experiments were performed at fishbone fly ash ratios of 0.0 and 1 10 settling times of 6 12 24 and 672h and W S ratios of 1.0 and 1.5mL g. The highest Pb removal efficiency reached 86.39 at 28days settling periods when the FB HAP dose was only 10 at W S 1.5mL g. FB HAP was found noticeably more effective than Apatite II particularly at shorter settling periods . Stabilization of Zn was efficient at longer settling period using FB HAP . The highest stabilization rate of Zn was 62.67 at W S 1.0mL g. The results indicated that settling time and W S ratio were the most important factors to enhance the stabilization of Pb and Zn in IFA . Utilization of waste fishbone is expected to be a low cost and eco friendly technology .

450,The management of food waste has been considered an extremely important issue since the 1990s but finding efficient solutions for small and rural communities is still challenging . Anaerobic digestion may provide interesting opportunities in terms of carbon emissions and economic payback in the long term but the choice of the correct technology and the spatial scale requires attention . The focus of this study is on a small rural municipality which is selected as a case study to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of the application of two options for AD and two spatial scales . Both the AD configurations are examined in terms of biogas exploitation through a combined heat and power generator and in combination with a post composting stage of the digestate . From economic and environmental perspectives the consortium scale application of the conventional wet process is expected to generate greater benefits in the long term as it enables 80 more electric energy production and economic revenues savings and avoids carbon emissions . However before selecting the technology decision makers should consider the public acceptance of local communities as the best technical economical solution may not be the most appropriate to specific communities . The methodology developed in this paper and the discussion of the results will inform decision makers about how to identify the most appropriate alternative for their purposes .
451,Recycling automotive waste has increasingly become an alternative solution towards producing sustainable materials given the rising issue of raw material shortages and waste management challenges at global level . The improper end of life vehicle waste management poses detrimental impacts on the environment . This paper proposes a novel method to develop thermal insulation sandwich panels using ELV waste motivated by the critical needs of creating high performance thermal insulation for buildings .

Recent research on microplastic pollution has mainly focused on aquatic ecosystems while knowledge gaps still exist regarding microplastic in terrestrial environments . In this study we established a new method for characterizing microplastic in complex soil substrate using FTIR spectroscopy . Microplastic was separated by density without removing soil organic matter to protect microplastic from damage . The Wizards feature was adopted to automatic direct and continuous characterize micron size plastic . Furthermore 33 soil samples were taken from Guiyu a notorious e waste dismantling area in Guangdong Province China under different land use . The results showed that microplastic was involved in 30 samples and the abundance of microplastic varied considerably among different soils ranged from 0 to 34 100n kg
455,This research assessed the impact of volatile fatty acids recovery and biomethane potential in an integrated fermentation digestion process with a single stage digestion of primary and rotating belt filtration sludges . Implementing semi continuous fermentation at 1 2 and 4days solids retention time showed a direct impact on the hydrolysis and VFA recovery which increased as SRT increased while also improving the dewaterability by reducing the concentrated sludge volume index of the processed sludge . pH controlled fermentation was effective improving the VFA yields by up to 93 and 72 at pH 9 for RBF and primary sludges respectively although fermentation at pH 6 showed promise for enhancing VFAs while lowering the required chemicals significantly . Although cellulose constituted only 21.0 and 29.5 of the TSS in primary and RBF sludges it contributed 3841 of the methane production for the two sludges respectively . Experimental results of integrated fermentation digestion and single stage digestion processes were incorporated in techno economic analysis . Results confirmed the economic viability of fermentation with payback periods of 2.71.1years and 3.62.7years while also revealed that VFA recovery could save up to 7.22.0 and 7.62.7 of the respective total sludge handling and disposal costs despite an average of 12.7 and 8.4 decrease in biogas production due to VFA extraction in the integrated systems of RBF and primary sludges respectively . Overall the integrated fermentation digestion system economically outperformed the single stage digestion for both sludge types under all studied scenarios .
456,With the rapid development of renewable energy the impact on environment and resource caused by waste photovoltaic modules has been realized gradually . To solve the problem recycling becomes an effectual way . Therefore the aim of this paper was to assess the economic feasibility of the photovoltaic modules recycling project in China by using cost benefit analysis . It was found that under the estimated treatment quantity will generate in China in 20202034 the recovery cost per kilowatt of photovoltaic modules will be 25.11 USD the unit benefit is 25.68 USD kW and the unit net benefit is 0.57 USD kW . The net present value and benefit cost ratio are 21.14 million USD and 1.023 . The sensitivity analysis indicated that the sale benefits of recycled materials and tax were the most sensitive factors affecting the project s economy . Finally we proposed ways to improve the economy for the government and related enterprises .

Theoretical calculations for suspension velocities of the current collectors and separators indicate that they could be separated under special conditions . Furthermore a special Z shaped pneumatic separator was used to separate the current collectors and separators for the first time . Experiments for manually cut samples indicate that the efficiency of pneumatic separation is approximately 100 with the sizes and airflow velocities in the range of 34cm and 6.967.8m s respectively . Furthermore industrial experiments of pneumatic separation indicate that the recoveries of the current collectors and separators are approximately 99.23 and 98.64 respectively . Computer simulations of the separation process indicate that the turbulence and the changes in high speed zones in the pneumatic separator benefit the separation of current collectors and separators . In conclusion pneumatic separation is a promising technology to separate crushed current collectors and separators .
458,The current worldwide expansion of waste PCB deposits represents both a pressing environmental issue and an economic opportunity fostering the development of numerous recycling processes across the world . An important input for designing such processes is the metallic content of WPCBs which is assayed by grinding and leaching samples taken from the stack of WPCBs to be recycled . The content values come with substantial uncertainties arising mainly from the uneven distribution of the metals within the structure of WPCBs .
459,Non hazardous industrial waste primarily consisting of manufacturing process residues has long been overlooked in waste reporting regulation and reuse . Limited information about NHIW generation with spatial and sectoral details has impeded the systematization of reuse efforts to move towards a resource efficient economy . In this article we develop a methodological framework that makes the best use of fragmented and limited observational data to infer the confidence intervals of NHIW generation by sector location and year across the United States . The framework decomposes the quantity of NHIW into two factors the activity level and the waste intensity factor . It statistically infers the probability distribution of the waste intensity factor and extrapolates waste tonnages to the entire country . In our demonstrative application of the method we provide an updated estimate for spent foundry sand and find that its total amount in the United States decreased from 2.27.1 million tons in 2004 to 1.44.7 million tons in 2014 . The spatial distribution however was highly uneven with over 90 of the waste generated in 10 of the counties indicating great variations in reuse potentials and benefits among regions . Our methodological framework makes a significant departure from existing estimations that usually rely on averaging limited observations or expert judgments biased by subjectivity . Detailing spatial and sectoral distributions and temporal trends in NHIW generation and reuse benefits our study could inform more systematic strategies on waste and materials management to build a circular economy .
460,The present work explored the production of volatile fatty acids through the anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge and cheese whey . Two batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the substrate mixing ratio and the initial pH on the acidogenic fermentation of SS with CW at different temperatures . The first batch experiment showed that a decrease of the SS proportion in the co digestion with CW led to a higher degree of acidification observing a synergistic effect at a SS CW mixing ratio of 25 75 . In the second batch experiment three temperatures and two initial pH were studied at SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios . Maximum degrees of acidification of 56 and 73 were achieved at 50C and initial pH of 5.5 for the SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios respectively . Finally the performance of a semi continuous reactor was demonstrated at laboratory scale reactor . Different hydraulic retention times pH and the effect of a thermal pre treatment of the SS was studied . The maximum degree of acidification in the lab scale reactor was 45 at 37C HRT of 20days and pH of 5.5 . Under these conditions the volatile fatty acids profile was dominated by butyric and acetic acids .
461,Packaging waste production especially single use containers is exerting detrimental effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including human health . To internalise the externalities associated with single use containers different instruments including a deposit refund scheme have been operationalised in many countries . Therefore DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro environmental behavioural change . This study addresses the complexity of single use plastic containers by analysing consumers perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland . Using 940 comments from the BBC Have Your Say messageboard this study adopts sentiment analysis to understand consumers opinions about the introduction and implementation of DRS in Scotland . Findings suggest that a UK wide scheme that is similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful . While consumers knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed the efficacy of DRS including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to sustainability . The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post consumer single use plastic containers . The implications of the findings for policy and practice especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed .
462,This paper assesses the performance of waste services in the region of Tuscany in Italy . It adopts non parametric techniques for this purpose . Furthermore it investigates the influence of the operational environment on the estimated performance by using the robust order m technique . Meaningful levels of inefficiency were found in the Italian waste services . A specification of the ownership of the operator entrusted with waste management by municipalities and the formal adoption of the zero waste strategy are included as environmental variables .
463,This study investigated the morphology and potentially toxic metal concentrations of paper waste based biochar and kitchen waste based biochar obtained at 500 and 700 C. The morphology and potentially toxic metals concentrations in the biochars were determined by SEM and FT IR analysis . The Cr Mn Cu and Cd concentrations in PB were low while the Ba content was relatively high at 0.1mgkg
464,Municipal solid waste is massively generated all over the world . Its organic fraction which represents a high percentage of MSW mainly contains biodegradable materials namely food waste paper and garden waste . The social cost of OFMSW treatment and or disposal is a serious and widespread problem particularly in highly populated areas . Thus effective and innovative solutions which include the upgrading of OFMSW are being currently sought . In fact the OFMSW abundance availability and average composition suggest its considerable potential within the circular economy desideratum paving the way to valorisation approaches . In this context an OFMSW sugar rich hydrolysate and its validation as a substrate for the production of the polyester poly to date the only bioplastic easily biodegradable in marine environment were successfully obtained in a previous study . Based on those results this work addresses the upscaling of the fermentative production in fed batch mode of P by

466,Over the last two decades Barcelona has implemented a far reaching reform of the citys solid waste collection . In 2000 the city was divided in four zones with four separate solid waste collection contracts being awarded to private firms with none being allowed to obtain more than two zones a rule that was revised in 2009 to just one contract per firm . This division of the market via exclusive territories sought to enhance competition in the expectation of the convergence of relative costs efficiency and service quality throughout the city . This study analyzes and evaluates the creation of lots as a tool of competition with monthly observations of costs and outputs between 2015 and 2019 . Main findings are that firms producing in larger zones report higher costs that increased competition was not sufficient to lead to converging costs and that none of the firms operate under increasing returns to scale . Based on our results we recommend creating an additional zone . We further suggest that if a public firm managed one of the zones the regulator would obtain more reliable information on the service costs and technical characteristics thus increasing her capabilities as supervisor of the private firms delivering the service in other zones .
467,China produced a large amount of construction and demolition waste owing to the rapid development of construction industry . Although a set of policies and regulations are being drafted in China for promoting C D waste recycling execution of these policies in practice seems to be far from effective . Currently approximately 75 of Chinese cities are still surrounded by large volumes of C D waste . Therefore identification of challenges in the development of C D waste management specially recycling is essential . This paper employs site visits to 10 recycling plants in 10 Chinese cities and interviews with 25 industry practitioners for examining the challenges . Eight challenges are identified unstable source of C D waste for recycling absence of subsidies for recycling activities and high cost for land use insufficient attention paid to design for waste minimisation absence of regulations on on site sorting unregulated landfill activities a lack of coordination among different government administration departments a lack of accurate estimation of waste quantity and distribution and a lack of an effective waste tracing system . Recommendations to address these challenges are presented . The results of this study are expected to aid policy makers in formulation of proper C D waste management in China and provide a useful reference for researchers who are interested in C D waste recycling industry .
468,Samples from 12 drillhole cores from the Urals Emba region to the north east of the Caspian Sea were analysed for pollen and spores . The records reveal vegetation and climate changes for the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene within the time interval from ca . 3.6 to ca . 1.65Ma . According to the results of the pollen analysis at the beginning of the Akchagylian stage there was a cooling and change in structure of the dendroflora and steppe dominated landscapes were present . At the end of the early Akchagylian and continuing into the middle Akchagylian a maximum variety of pollen from tree species occurred . The presence of mesophilic and thermophilic elements signifies a moderately warm and humid climate occurred at around 3.2Ma probably related to the Mid Pliocene Warm Period . A second major cooling occurred at around 2.5Ma coinciding with the onset of northern hemisphere glaciations . During this time coniferous forests dominated by
469,The clay mineralogy and geochemistry of loess is sensitive to variations in sediment source area transport processes and weathering regime over time and thus careful study of them can provide some insight into past climate variability . The well known loesspaleosol sequences on the Iranian Loess plateau are generally underlain by the red deposits consisting of reddish clay to silt sized sediments of wind blown origin . Study and analyzing of this oldest brown and reddish brown loess has a specific role in paleoclimate reconstruction but no previous study of the clay mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of them has been performed to date . Therefore total Fe
470,The stratotype section of Paks brickyard provides the most detailed accessible loess paleosol sequence from almost the entire Pleistocene in the middle part of the Carpathian Basin . The best and thickest loess archives of Hungary are preserved in this part of the basin and now two more drilling cores were deepened in this area on plateau position on loessic ridges PA I and PA II .
471,The horticultural societies of the central zone of Chile in the first millennium AD and the first half of the second have been the subject of archaeological study for many years and their cultural contexts have been described extensively . Their material culture lifeways and settlement patterns present significant differences between the Bato and Llolleo groups in the Early Ceramic period and between these and the Aconcagua groups of the Late Intermediate period . Increasing complexity social differentiation and changes in polity structure have been proposed but robust data are still missing for many of these interpretations . The object of this work was to contribute to the identification of inter and intra group social differences in mobility sex and age patterns and maize consumption based on stable isotope analysis of human bones and a sub sample of teeth . Analysis of the C N and O stable isotopes in collagen and bioapatite extracted from the samples showed differences between the three groups studied in spatial mobility patterns and consumption of C
472,Pottery from Kom W a Neolithic stratified site on the Fayum north shore includes intact vessels as well as sherd fragments with fragmented pottery also found on adjacent deflated surfaces . In part because of this material Kom W was previously interpreted as a village associated with the introduction of domestic plants and animals from southwest Asia . Here pottery recovered from Kom W by Caton Thompson and Gardner during their 1920s excavations is reviewed and compared to pottery from other north shore sites . Vessel size is reconstructed as well as placement of the vessels within Kom W. It is suggested that a number of vessels found at Kom W were used for storage in line with similar evidence from the Fayum north shore and from northeast Africa more generally .
473,Study of clay mineral is one of effective methods for reconstruction of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment . Here we represent clay mineral records from an upper MiocenePliocene red clay succession in the central Chinese Loess Plateau . On the basis of the existing age model we employ X ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy to carry out clay mineral analyses the results indicated that illite was the dominant clay mineral and the contents of smectite chlorite and kaolinite were minor . From the analysis of contents of clay minerals illite crystallinity illite 5 10 smectite ratio magnetic susceptibility summer monsoon intensity and deep sea
474,In tropical Southern Hemisphere South America late Quaternary marine core and speleothem records provide different proxies and accurate chronologies correlating millennial scale intervals of increased precipitation with southward shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone . However the climatic effect of these intervals on coastal landforms is poorly understood . Here we investigated the response of abrupt and long lasting climate events during the Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 2 in a 13.8 m thick sand succession located in a large scale coastal eolian system the Lenis Maranhenses Dunefield NE Brazil where winds and precipitation are anti phased and controlled by the single action of the ITCZ . A chronology of the sediment overburden determined by optically stimulated luminescence dating of 14 sediment samples obtained at 1 m intervals showed ages between 132.27.0 and 12.90.6 thousand years ago in stratigraphic order . A multi proxy approach based on grain size surface grain texture heavy minerals thermoluminescence sensitivity inorganic geochemistry reflectance and magnetic parameters from 268 sediment samples collected at 5 cm intervals indicated periods of dune building and stabilization . Significant stabilization periods are synchronous with Heinrich Stadials 6 4 3 2 and 1 and Greenland Stadial 4 within age model uncertainties . Heavy mineral analysis indicated a steady sand source to the dune succession while TL sensitivity analysis of quartz grains showed the input allochthonous sediments during stadials . The preservation of peak dune activity during the Last Glacial Maximum is attributed to the enduring precipitation brought by the subsequent Heinrich Stadial 1 event .
475,The expression of the abrupt cooling of the 8.2 ka event in the tropics is poorly understood . In this study we applied lithostratigraphy loss on ignition grain size and pollen analyses to sedimentary sequences from Thale Noi which is located in the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand in order to reconstruct the regional environmental history during the 8.2 ka event . Our results based on sediment . This characteristics and pollen records indicated that the study area was likely to have flooded prior to c. 8300 cal . a BP . The fall in sea level coincided with a high precipitation inferred from grain size between c. 8250 and 8100cal a BP . The increased precipitation can be attributed to the strengthening of the northeast monsoonal rains in the western Gulf of Thailand . The timing of the sea level fall and strengthen stronger winter monsoon is consistent with the abrupt decrease in the temperature records emanating from the northern hemisphere . Subsequently we observed a sea level rise from c. 8100 to 7950cal a BP which potentially continued till c. 7650 cal . a BP . The possibility of coastal erosion was detected by a hiatus in the sedimentary sequences dated between c. 7950 and 7650cal a BP . Then a standstill of the sea level occurred from c. 7650 to 7100cal a BP . This transgression is suggested to have caused coastal erosion that resulted in a hiatus in the sedimentation process between c. 7950 and 7650cal a BP . Correspondingly fluctuations in the monsoon strength resulted in an overall decreased precipitation from c. 8100 to 7450cal a BP although punctuated wet intervals were observed at c. 7950 and 7575cal a BP .
476,In this study we report the high resolution heavy mineral records from a 200.30m long borehole on the northern coast of modern Yellow River delta covering the last 1.90Myr . The results show that the heavy mineral assemblages are dominated by epidote followed by hornblende garnet and hematite limonite . In the Yellow River sediments the content of hornblende is higher than the epidote and the epidote to hornblende ratios are lower than the core YRD 1101 . The E H show two distinct lower values at depositional unit 42 and DU 41 to DU 2 indicating the obvious influence of YR sediments . The heavy mineral composition of DU 5 is distinct from YR sediments and interpreted as the result from heterogeneous provenance of the adjacent ancient rivers while DU 4 to DU 1 resemble the upper middle reaches of the YR sediments . The different sediment types of core YRD 1101 do not contain markedly different transparent heavy mineral assemblages in terms of concentration and mineral ratios . No matter how sedimentary environment changes the ratios of epidote and hornblende show very stable values in DU 41 and DU 3 due to the influence of YR sediments . The transparent heavy minerals such as hornblende epidote and other stable minerals which were relatively stable are controlled primarily by provenance while the sedimentary environment mostly influences the flaky minerals and the authigenic minerals . This study provides evidence regarding the history of the lower reaches of the YR and YRD since the early Pleistocene highlighting river s important role for the evolution of the western coast of the Bohai Sea .
477,Trapped charge dating of optically bleached quartz which involves techniques such as electron spin resonance and thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence is increasingly being used to establish Middle and Early Pleistocene chronologies for archaeological palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental sedimentary sequences . Comparative dating studies that make use of several independent or semi independent radiometric techniques in tandem are an invaluable means of assessing the reliability of optically bleached quartz dating methods and ascertaining empirical relationships between different quartz dating signals . In this study we undertake a comparative dating evaluation of single grain TT OSL and various ESR signals that exhibit different optical resetting properties at the Middle Pleistocene archaeological site of Porto Maior northwest Spain which contains a distinctive regionally significant Acheulean stone tool assemblage . We expand the existing chronological framework for Porto Maior using single grain TT OSL dating derive combined numerical ages for individual depositional units using Bayesian modelling and further examine the relationship between ESR and TT OSL signals by reviewing a range of published comparative dating studies . The new single grain TT OSL ages obtained for unit PM3 at Porto Maior are in close agreement with previously published ESR TiLi ages for this unit and significantly younger than those reported for the Al centre . Our broader comparison of published TT OSL ESR dating results also shows statistically significant agreement between single grain TT OSL and TiLi centre ages in other sedimentary settings suggesting a potentially closer relationship between the TT OSL producing traps and the TiLi paramagnetic centres in quartz rather than between the TT OSL and Al centre signals . The Bayesian modelling results for Porto Maior enable us to refine the existing bracketing depositional age for the archaeological accumulation at Porto Maior and provide a stronger statistical foundation for chronostratigraphic correlations with other Acheulean archaeological deposits found in the Mio River basin . The Bayesian model indicates that the entire Porto Maior sedimentary sequence was deposited between 312.632.6 ka and 18.87.7 ka and that the
478,This paper presents data on the fragments of ancient sedimentary deposits placed around the Piedade and Casa Branca streams important right bank tributaries of the Paraopeba River . From these data it was possible to establish a picture regarding the paleomorphology and paleodrainage of the area . The methodological steps adopted consisted of the definition of sedimentary facies as well as the establishment of their sedimentary provenance and deposition age . Through the facies analyses it was possible to show channel facies associated with debris flows and sieve deposits . In the sedimentary provenance stage spectra of ages congruent with those found in literature for the Moeda and Cau Formations were identified suggesting that the Moeda mountain range is a source area . We also analyzed data on the sediments of the current bed which indicate the same provenance showing that the current courses constitute an embedded analog of the paleochannels . The data herein obtained corroborate the hypothesis that the eastern periphery of the Bonfim Complex was dominated by a system of alluvial fans between 9.51 and 15.51.6 ka before present whose remnants are preserved on the current hilltops and mid slopes of the basement landscape .
479,Turkey is the last important domestic animal to have been introduced to Europe . It reached the Carpathian Basin at a historically critical time when this area was divided between the Catholic Hungarian Kingdom allied with Austria the Ottoman Turkish Empire and Protestant Transylvania a Turkish protectorate . This politically complex situation was also reflected in trade connections . Potential import routes therefore are unclear . Introduction from western central European countries is consonant with the spread of turkeys in the European continent but contacts between the Ottoman Turkish and Spanish trade networks may also be reckoned with . Two of the five sites that yielded turkey bones in Hungary fell outside Ottoman Turkish occupation . One originates from an urban context that only temporarily fell under Turkish rule . All turkey remains found at these settlements can be associated with elite consumption . Their anatomical distribution is dominated by meat rich skeletal elements . This paper is also a review of literary and linguistic evidence regarding the occurrence of turkeys in the territory of present day Hungary .
480,The Three Gorges Valley linking the upper and the middle lower Yangtze River areas is a key area for understanding the geomorphological evolution of the Yangtze River valley especially the timing of its formation which remains controversial and occurred following the authors to from the pre Miocene to Late Pleistocene periods . The 100m thick Yichang Gravel Layer extending over an area 100km
481,There is extensive evidence for extraction of grease and fat from bones of ungulates at Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene sites in the Southern Levant . Excavations at Shubayqa 6 identified an area where extensive processing of carcasses took place during the transition between the Late Natufian to Early Pre Pottery Neolithic A . Large quantities of fire cracked basalt highly fragmented faunal remains and burnt bones indicate that grease and fat were extracted on a large scale . Spatial analysis demonstrates that bird remains were discarded in the same location where this fat rendering took place . Waterfowl dominate the assemblage and would have been present mainly in the winter . Body part representation of the bird remains suggests that this abundance of avifauna resulted in people selectively processing the carcasses of the wetland birds they hunted . Gazelles would have been in peak condition at this time of year with higher concentrations of fat stored in their bodies . This seasonal glut of resources contrasts with the summer especially late summer when most of the commonly hunted bird species were absent and the gazelle in relatively poor condition . People aware of seasonal cycles in resource abundance may have preserved foods when available . Storing fat conserves resources for leaner times . Compared to the Natufian site of Shubayqa 1 fewer young gazelle in the faunal remains at Shubayqa 6 is an indication that hunting either targeted mature animals or was more intense in the winter when fewer young animals are present . Carcasses from juvenile animals are comprised of less fat and the association of the adult gazelle carcasses with the bird remains suggests that the two resources were processed alongside one another . Preservation of foodstuffs for leaner months of the year may have been one potential outcome of this activity .
482,A high number industrial hearths furnaces and kilns were excavated from an Indus archaeological site 4MSR on the dry bed of Ghaggar Hakra river channel near India Pakistan international border providing numerous artifacts of Indus metallurgical activity Gold and Silver anvil fishhook arrowhead spearhead moulds slag etc . . Array of inter connected hearths vats range of stone weights and beads made of semi precious stones further suggest the site was being used as a metal craft factory . Nine
483,We present the results of a new dating study carried out at Lunery la Terre des Sablons and Brinay la Noira two key Lower Palaeolithic sites located in deposits associated to the Cher River . These sites preserve abundant Mode 1 and Mode 2 lithic industries and are considered as among the oldest evidence of hominin presence in Western Europe north of the 45N latitude . Following a multi technique approach combining electron spin resonance single grain thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz grains and palaeomagnetism we obtained new chronological constraints for the sedimentary sequence and the associated lithic assemblages at the two sites . The new independent dating results derived from each method are consistent and in overall agreement with existing ESR and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide burial age estimates except for the Lowermost Unit 3at LTS . By integrating all of the previous and new dating results we derive combined age estimates of 772 735 ka and 66529 ka for the fluvial sands at LTS and BN respectively . These two distinct aggradation phases may tentatively be correlated to interglacial glacial transitions associated with Marine Isotope Stage 19 18 for the former and MIS 17 16 for the latter .
484,The Palaeolithic rock engravings that are located along the Naln river basin in Northern Spain have been studied from various perspectives but no use wear studies on the stone tools used to produce such engravings have ever been undertaken . This paper aims to explore a new approach to this type of incisions based on use wear analysis of experimental lithic tools used to engrave limestone blocks and slabs . Our results show that the use wear traces generated by engraving limestone are well developed and can be defined with specific criteria . The principal objective of this study was to provide the first experimental reference collection of use wear resulting from engraving limestone using flint and quartzite experimental tools to compare with the traces that appear on tools in the archaeological record in contexts with parietal and portable art and more specifically to add a new approach to the multidisciplinary study of the La Via rock shelter .
485,Kettle holes are common ice decay features in formerly glacial landscapes like those in Southern Scandinavia and Northern Germany . Here the kettle holes are represented either as dry depressions wetland areas or lakes . However the majority of these features are silted and part of the present farmland . We investigated a small kettle hole at Tyrsted near the township of Tyrsted south of Horsens with the aim to determine the extension and depth of this feature using geophysical methods . A former excavation at Tyrsted carried out from the Horsens Museum in 2017at a neighboring site revealed Late Palaeolithic flint of the Bromme type and worked reindeer antlers . This connection in a Late Glacial horizon is unique not only in a Danish context and it can help to improve and clarify the dating of the Bromme culture . We used ground penetrating radar electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography to estimate the extension of the kettle hole . Shear wave reflection and refraction seismics were able to detect the bottom sediment of the former lake at about 5m depth . Furthermore a seismic event at about 1.30m depth is visible which can be associated to the transition between the Allerd and Younger Dryas sediment making the detection of the Bromme horizon possible . After the non invasive investigation a location for an open excavation has been chosen in a way to groundtruth the geophysical results allowing the direct comparison with the stratigraphy . These results allow the archaeologists to identify key excavation areas focused on the investigation of the Allerd and Younger Dryas layers in a way to improve the dating information about the Bromme horizon collected so far . Furthermore geophysical investigations together with excavations will enable the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research groups to search large scale palaeolandscapes for these very rare but highly important finds .
486,Seismic hazards and risks around an individual fault can be assessed from complementary paleoseismic data . A high resolution sediment core recovered from the Yileimu Lake revealed 11 potential paleoearthquakes around the Fuyun fault in northern Xinjiang . Among them three events recorded by ductile deformation and turbidites or coseismic subsidence were possibly correlated with
487,Our understanding on glacier climate link in the Himalayan region is constrained due to lack of long term observational and high resolution proxy records . Hostile weather conditions and difficult approaches to access glaciers due to rough terrains largely limit observational studies on glaciers in the Himalaya . Sub alpine trees and shrubs close to glaciers growth of which is very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature provide precise continuous record on climate and glacier behaviour to supplement the observational records back to several centuries . To unfold the Gangotri glacier dynamics in the past we developed tree ring chronologies and studied the colonization pattern of the trees in the region . Tree ring chronologies of Himalayan birch and Himalayan pine developed from their respective upper tree line ecotone in the Gangotri glacier forefields showed impact of temperature on the growth variations . A comparison of Himalayan pine chronology with temperature proxies revealed regional and hemispheric scale temperature signal . Using tree ring chronologies we show expansion of the Gangotri glacier during cool phases that are also in agreement with the glacier fluctuation records from Central Asia and Southern Tibet . Moreover using tree colonization pattern in the glacier forefields we established for the first time that the Gangotri glacier terminus receded 1.853km since the late 16th century major part of which receded since 1935 C.E . The glacier retreat associated with the onset of 20th century warming got accelerated since 1957 C.E . . In view of our findings the Gangotri glacier might further face accelerated recession in the 21st century under the projected warming .
488,Settlement distribution modelling assumes that human spatial behaviour can be revealed by using the correct set of variables . However the regional variables of large scale gradients are only considered rarely . Also settlement modelling applications are often impeded by fragmentary and error prone datasets . Thus in current day Lithuania in order to study the dynamics of settlement distributional rules we implemented a modelling strategy that involves the use of statistical and machine learning methods with null model simulations and that is less affected by the incompleteness of datasets and the scales of variables . In this study we used regional variables in order to test their usefulness while providing a general understanding of the large scale processes that governed settlement distribution in prehistory . This study encompassed six time intervals between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages . The obtained results consisted of regional settlement predictive maps estimations of random forest variable importance and performances of GAM models as well as determinations of Besag s L functions of settlement patterns and Euclidean distances between the regional variables at the settlement sites . We detected decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the settlement prediction maps and settlement patterns declining variable importance and model performance as well as increasing regional environmental diversity of the settlement sites . A marked manifestation of these trends was observed between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages . This also corresponded to a major change in the constitution of the most important variables of the settlement distributions . We associate these findings with technological and lifestyle changes in the southern Baltic region interpreting them as causing a roughening of the human adaptive landscape increasing the specificity number and complexity of the settlement distributional rules . Our study revealed that even for incomplete datasets and spatial autocorrelation the application of advanced statistical machine learning techniques was able to provide new insights into the processes that governed the socio cultural evolution and spatial dynamics of humans in prehistory .

However not much is known about how different types of diverging information and individual differences affect epistemic change . In a preregistered study
492,Some research suggests that university lecture attendance positively correlates with academic performance . Although there are several motivational pathways which may explain attendance few studies have examined the psychosocial factors leading to student attendance intentions and behavior . Consequently we evaluated via structural equation modeling two prominent motivational theories to help explain lecture attendance Self Determination Theory and The Theory of Planned Behavior . Undergraduates
493,To profile children s reading comprehension we developed a dynamic approach with componential abilities being assessed within the same texts and provided with feedback in addition to the global comprehension of these texts . In 275 Dutch third to fifth graders we investigated to what extent the response accuracy for questions on componential abilities on first attempts and after feedback predicted global text comprehension within the same texts as well as the prospective development in a standardized reading comprehension test . We found that global text comprehension was increased by each correctly answered question on a componential ability on first attempts and by each correctly answered sentence integration question after feedback . The accuracy on first attempts also explained unique variance of the growth in the standardized reading comprehension test . A dynamic approach may thus help to arrive at a better understanding of the profiles of children s reading comprehension .
494,We show that higher capital and liquidity ratios increase the efficiency of conventional and Islamic banks . Using conditional quantile regressions we further show that the effect is stronger for highly efficient small highly liquid and highly capitalized conventional banks . We also find that more capitalized and liquid banks were efficient during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and the Arab Spring . Our findings support the view that the constraints imposed by
495,Induced pluripotent stem cells have opened up unprecedented opportunities for novel therapeutic options for precision medicine . Hematopoietic stem cell donor pools with previously determined HLA types may be ideal sources for iPSC production . Based on the HLA distribution of cryopreserved cord blood units and registered bone marrow donors we estimated how much of the Korean population could be covered by HLA homozygous iPSCs . We analyzed a total of 143 866 Korean HSC donors . Each donor sample was typed for the HLA A B and DRB1 alleles at low to intermediate resolution by DNA based molecular techniques PCR sequence specific oligonucleotide PCR with sequence specific primers and PCR with sequence based typing . We also identified individuals possessing homozygous HLA haplotypes by direct counting . The matching probabilities for zero mismatch transplantation were calculated for 143 866 Koreans and 50 million potential Korean patients . Among the HSC donor pool 17 HLA A alleles 41 HLA B alleles and 13 HLA DRB1 alleles as well as 128 homozygous HLA A B DRB1 haplotypes were identified at serologic equivalents and those haplotypes cumulatively matched 93.20 of the 143 866 Korean donors as zero HLA mismatch iPSC sources . Among the combinations of 2 056 haplotypes with frequencies 0.001 in a population of 50 million those 128 homozygous haplotypes can provide 93.65 coverage for potential Korean recipients . Haplobanking of a reasonable number of HLA A B and DRB1 homozygous iPSC lines derived from CBUs and cells of registered BM donors may be an efficient option for allogenic iPSC therapy .
496,Patients with severe aplastic anemia who fail immunosuppressive therapy have a dismal prognosis . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is one of the most effective treatment options . Two institutions have independently adopted a post transplantation cyclophosphamide approach for patients with SAA undergoing HSCT from a URD . Thirteen patients were included 11 of whom had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy . Eight patients had a mismatched URD . All patients were conditioned with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in various dosage combinations . PTCy was given at a dose of 100 mg kg . Two patients died and overall survival was 85 at 2 years . All patients engrafted but 1 patient developed secondary graft failure . Of the 11 patients alive after 2 years 9 had complete donor chimerism . All surviving patients were transfusion independent . Ten patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation and 2 patients had more than 1 reactivation . No Epstein Barr virus reactivation or post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease was observed . Four patients had mild hemorrhagic cystitis . In summary our findings show that PTCy is a promising treatment for patients with SAA undergoing URD HSCT .
497,The emotional and physical toll on caregivers of cancer patients is well documented but research evaluating the financial burdens and time commitments of caregivers is limited . We suspected that the rural location of our cancer center would intensify these burdens for caregivers . We conducted a prospective trial to assess the out of pocket expenses and time commitment of caregivers of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients within the first 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital from a National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer center . These results show that caregivers of autologous recipients paid out of pocket expenses of 196 over 4 weeks . If lost wages were included the expenses increased to 736 during this period . Caregivers of allogeneic recipients had out of pocket expenses of 110 in 4 weeks or a total of 610 when lost wages were included . In the month after discharge from the hospital caregivers traveled a median distance of 450 miles or 560 miles depending on whether the patient received an autologous transplant or an allogeneic transplant respectively . These results demonstrate a compelling need to address caregiver support given the significant financial out of pocket expenses and time commitment .
498,Refractory early relapsed and 17p deletion p53 mutation TP53mut positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been conventionally considered a high risk disease potentially eligible for treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation . In this multicenter retrospective analysis of 157 patients we compared the outcomes of patients with high risk CLL treated with alloSCT a B cell receptor pathway inhibitor and both . Seventy one patients were treated with BCRis 67 patients underwent reduced intensity conditioning alloSCT and 19 received alloSCT with a BCRi before and or after transplantation .

We included 98 CMV positive patients 30 undergoing haploidentical HSCT and 68 undergoing URD HSCT . The majority of patients had a malignant disease received a myeloablative conditioning regimen and received a bone marrow graft . The median pretransplantation anti CMV IgG level was 109 U mL . With median follow up of 2.2 years a total of 72 CMV reactivations occurred in 50 patients . There was no difference in CMV reactivation pattern between haploidentical HSCT recipients and URD HSCT recipients . In multivariable analysis until the first event the incidence of CMV reactivation was higher in patients with anti CMV IgG levels 100 U mL 2.38
500,Autologous CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocyte therapy is an approved and effective treatment for the management of patients with refractory and multiply relapsed B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Experience using this therapy in pediatric patients with extramedullary disease is limited in part because these patients have frequently been excluded from clinical trials owing to concerns for an increased risk of immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome . We infused 7 patients with refractory or multiply relapsed B ALL who presented with isolated EM relapse with tisagenlecleucel . Six patients had isolated central nervous system leukemia and 1 patient had an isolated testicular relapse . An initial complete response was seen in all patients with 5 patients remaining in CAR T induced remission at a median of 18 months from first infusion . Reversible ICANS was seen in 1 patient with CNS leukemia . Durable B cell aplasia occurred in 3 patients with a median time to B cell recovery of 6.5 months in the other patients . These data suggest that CAR T therapy has promising safety and efficacy in treating EM leukemia although definitive conclusions are limited by the small size of the cohort and limited follow up period .
501,The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in the development of host innate immune cells such as monocytes dendritic cells and natural killer cells . We examined the association between intestinal microbiota and subsequent immune reconstitution of circulating monocyte DC and NK cell subsets in 38 adult patients undergoing single unit cord blood transplantation . A higher diversity of intestinal microbiota at 1 month was significantly associated with higher counts of plasmacytoid DCs at 7 months after CBT as measured by the Chao1 index . Principal coordinate analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances showed significant differences between higher and lower classical monocyte reconstitution at 7 months post CBT . The families
502,Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is performed as a curative treatment for children with nonmalignant diseases such as bone marrow failure syndromes and primary immunodeficiencies . Because graft versus host disease is a major factor affecting survival probability and quality of life after HSCT the availability of HLA matched donors restricts the application of HSCT . Recently HSCT with post transplantation cyclophosphamide has emerged as a potent method to prevent GVHD after HSCT from HLA haploidentical donors and some studies have suggested the safety of PTCy HSCT for nonmalignant diseases . We conducted a prospective clinical trial aiming to help confirm the safety of HSCT and further reduction of GVHD using a combination of PTCy and low dose antithymocyte globulin from HLA mismatched related donors for children with nonmalignant diseases . Six patients underwent HSCT and achieved engraftment at a median of 14.5 days and no patient developed severe acute GVHD . All patients had sustained donor chimerism without developing chronic GVHD at the last follow up . In conclusion HSCT with PTCy and low dose ATG from an HLA mismatched related donor were feasible to control GVHD for nonmalignant diseases in the children involved in our study .

Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms . PRES was diagnosed based on clinic radiological evidence . Follow up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months . Forty one patients with FA were enrolled . Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals . The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1 locus mismatch
504,The combination of hypomethylating agents with the selective Bcl 2 inhibitor venetoclax has emerged as a highly active regimen in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in both the upfront and relapsed refractory settings . We report our early experience with a cohort of patients who were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after HMA VEN therapy . Thirty two patients with AML with a median age of 62 years underwent alloHCT after HMA VEN therapy . Twenty two were in complete remission CR with incomplete count recovery at time of HCT . With a median follow up of 14.4 months the 1 year overall survival was 62.5 and disease free survival was 43.8 . The 1 year nonrelapse mortality rate was 18.8 and the cumulative incidence of relapse was 37.5 . Among patients who underwent alloHCT in CR the 1 year OS was 77.3 and the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 9.1 . The cumulative incidence of grade II IV acute graft versus host disease was 43.8 . We conclude that alloHCT after HMA VEN is therapy associated with favorable allogeneic HCT outcomes in newly diagnosed older patients with AML as well as those with r r AML .

The median age of the cohort was 58 years . High risk cytogenetics were found in 50 of the patients . All patients received a proteasome inhibitor and or immunomodulatory drug based regimen before transplantation . At the time of transplantation 10 patients obtained at least a very good partial response . The response after autoSCT was at least a VGPR in 6 patients in 5 . All patients undergoing alloSCT achieved a CR at 3 months . Maintenance therapy was provided to 5 patients after autoSCT . The median progression free survival after transplantation was 6 months in the autoSCT group compared with 18 months in the alloSCT group

519,Mammary tumours occur frequently in female dogs where such tumours exhibit complexity when examined histologically . These tumours are composed not only of proliferative luminal epithelial cells but also of myoepithelial cells and or mesenchymal cells with cartilage and osseous tissues in a solitary mass . The origin of this complexed histogenesis remains speculative but cancer stem cells are likely involved . CSCs possess self renewing capacity differentiation potential high tumourigenicity in immunodeficient mice and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation . These cells are at the apex of a hierarchy in cancer tissues and are involved in tumour initiation recurrence and metastasis .

Herein a fiber based flexible porous composite is presented as sound insulator fabricated via single sided coating finishing on the one side of a nonwoven framework and has been demonstrated for high performance noise reduction . The enhanced acoustic insulation is identified to be structure dependent of the area density and microstructure of the sound insulator and the type of filler . The flexible sound insulator exhibits 100 enhancement in broadband acoustic insulation over the whole frequency range compared to the bare nonwovens . And the most sound transmission loss of at the peak is up to 37dB which is about 30 times that of bare nonwovens . Furthermore the novel sound insulator has an admirable dual gradient structure in which the concentration gradient of coating finishing agent is opposite to the pore gradient .

Unfortunately how to control its operational frequency is still an open question . Here taking the advantage of an aligned carbon nanotubes array polydimethylsiloxane composite with anisotropic thermal conductivity we introduce a novel optoacoustic transducer . Based on an advanced inductively coupled plasma etching technology the composite s thickness can be reduced from 200m to 18m . When its thickness is approximately 18m high frequency laser generated ultrasound can be obtained . It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the transducer s operational frequency is reverse proportion to the thickness of CNTs array PDMS composite which can confirm that this optoacoustic transducer works in thickness mode . Furthermore this kind of device can be miniaturized and amounted on tip of an optical fiber to realize all optical high frequency ultrasound imaging . All these encouraging results suggest that this novel CNTs array PDMS composite may provide an effective path for the frequency control of the optoacoustic transducer and this obtained device has the potential to be used for biomedical ultrasound applications in the future .

Ecological alternatives to the panel skin and adhesive such as a recycled PET bottle foil and a castor oil bio polyurethane respectively are tested and compared to commercial components . Bottle caps are characterised using a small punch test specially developed to obtain the properties of the bottle caps . Additionally low cost reinforcement is added to adhesives to enhance the mechanical behaviour of the panel . The sustainable panels achieve enhanced efficiency compared to aluminium based panels for core shear strength and stiffness besides having similar specific flexural properties compared to those of epoxy based PET panels . Despite their higher strength and stiffness epoxy polymer based panels show visible adhesive peeling off to bottle caps core and aluminium skin . In contrast the biopolymer exhibits larger deformation and debonding of both substrates indicating a progressive and ductile failure . The satisfactory efficiency of sustainable panels confirms the promising reuse of recycled bottle caps in structural applications .

533,As an important inorganic material geopolymer has been widely used for ceramics and sustainable cement in concrete . Sodium aluminosilicate hydrate gel known as the zeolite precursor gel has the most critical impact on the performance of geopolymer . The nano micromechanical properties of N A S H have been investigated in several studies but the resutls are always inconsistent . A novel compromise approach using Maximum Likelihood Estimation for deconvolution of nanoindentation data is introduced to fundamentally further understand this issue in this study . Correlation and difference of different statistical techniques are compared to clarify the rationality of this method . Multiple characterization techniques including microstructure observation at micro and nano scale element analysis and crystal identification are applied to reveal the mechanisms . The results indicate that the elastic modulus and hardness of the N A S H gel in geopolymer under different silica modulus and curing conditions vary in a small range from 10.50 to 14.30GPa and from 0.40 to 0.57GPa respectively . When applying statistical nanoindentation in geopolymer two kinds of spurious phases mixed phases and sub phases are unavoidable .

537,Ultra High Performance Concrete is a relatively new construction material which has been investigated over the past few decades . Despite its exceptional mechanical strength UHPC still requires passive steel reinforcement to maximise its bending capacity and the overall material cost will be high . The basalt fibre rebar has a higher mechanical strength than steel rebar with lower cost . In addition it also has better alkali resistance and good cost effectiveness . The basalt fibre rebar is therefore considered as a potential alternative reinforcement in the structural member . In this study a recently developed UHPC formula was adopted the conventional steel rebar and basalt fibre rebar were used as reinforcement . The developed components were tested against static flexural and methane air explosion loads . In the four point flexural tests the basalt fibre rebar reinforced specimen performed more ductile structural behaviour with higher flexural strength . Two large scale methane air explosion tests were conducted in buried utility tunnels with different length . The experimental test in shorter tunnel yielded lower explosion pressure with marginal structural response . The test in longer tunnel achieved a higher explosion pressure on concrete elements . The C30 and UHPC specimens with steel basalt fibre rebar reinforcement were tested . The pressure and deflection data revealed that basalt fibre rebar reinforced UHPC component had a more ductile structural behaviour against accidental gas explosion .
538,Novel fiber metal hybrid tubes with overlapped fiber reinforced plastics and aluminum layers were proposed in this paper . By combining progressive failure behavior of composites and large plastic deformation of metal materials the structure was hybridized at mesoscopic scale . To this end circular fiber aluminum hybrid tubes with various inner diameters combined with parent materials were fabricated using vacuum bag molding process . Quasi static uniaxial compressive tests were conducted to comprehensively explore the effects of geometric factors and failure patterns on energy absorption capability . The experimental results revealed that the pristine FRP and CF Al hybrid tubes collapsed in a progressive failure mode and generated abundant intra and inter laminar cracks during crushing . The GF Al hybrid tubes with large diameters collapsed in an unstable and inefficient mode due to local buckling and delamination . Compared with bare aluminum tubes the specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of CF Al hybrid structures were improved significantly by respectively 54.3 and 40.4 for tubes with 40mm inner diameter . Furthermore the CFE of CF Al hybrid structures improved by more than 40 when compared to their bare CFRP counterparts though the SEA reduced by more than 5.5 . In sum the proposed hybrid design efficiently reduced the peak crushing force with desirable SEA which has great potential for low cost and lightweight energy absorber applications .
539,N doped carbon nanosheet and B N co doped carbon nanosheet are first prepared through exfoliation of carbon of Schiff based covalent organic frameworks under ultrasound using sodium lignin sulfonate as the intercalation agent and modifier .

A new fire hazard evaluation system based on analytic hierarchy process is raised to comprehensively estimate fire risk of prepared sample . It is deduced from AHP that PVA loaded with 4wt BNC nanosheet shows the lowest fire risk . The effect of BNC nanosheet on pyrolysis mode of PVA in gaseous and condensed phase has also been investigated to figure out the reason for low fire risk of treated PVA .
540,Proteins polysaccharide scaffolds have been attracted extensive attentions in tissue engineering for decades . However degradation of these biocomposites are still unknown owe to their difference in hydrophilicity pore morphology density and crystallinity which obviously limits their applications . Here we designed a silk fibroin hyaluronic acid nerve conduit with oriented channels combining with different components and HA interpenetrating network to improve stability and biodegradation of the conduit . The conduit exhibited well organized porous structure remarkable flexibility water absorption and stability determined by morphology and solubility tests . The structure analysis showed that the silk I structures are dominant of the SF HA conduits . The drug release behavior of the conduits demonstrated gradient release of rhodamine B with an attribute to the oriented channels . Further by HA skeleton of interpenetrating network the SF HA conduits retained conduit and porous morphology in protease XIV solution for 21days . More importantly the conduits showed good biocompatibility which are verified by the growth and phenotype of mouse embryonic stem cell . This study broadening the understanding of the biodegradation behavior of protein polysaccharide biocomposites and provides promising design strategy for nerve conduits .

542,Polysulfide rubbers have been widely used as high performance sealants to line or seal aircraft fuel tanks . In this research liquid polysulfide oligomers graphene oxide nanocomposite was prepared through the mild reaction between liquid polysulfide oligomers and graphene oxide nanosheets and was dispersed into PSR to obtain LPO GO PSR composites . Benefit from the grafting of polysulfide oligomer segments on the surface of GO good dispersion of LPO GO in PSR matrix was achieved . The mechanical properties of PSR composites were enhanced by LPO GO . The elongation at break and tensile strength of the 0.5 LPO GO PSR composites were about 70 and 43 higher than that of neat PSR . The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis results showed that the storage modulus of PSR was increased by 206 when 0.5 of LPO GO was added . The broadband dielectric spectroscopy results indicated that LPO GO was well dispersed in PSR and some phenomena of molecular chain movement in PSR matrix . Study of the reinforcing mechanism showed that a number of thiol groups and SS bonds had been attached onto the surface of GO after being modified by LPO which quietly promoted the dispersion of LPO GO in PSR matrix and strengthened the interfacial interactions between LPO GO with PSR .
543,It is difficult for polymeric materials to avoid the conflict between the mechanical properties and flowability in manufacturing large sized injection molded products . To solve the issue this paper develops an industrial volume pulsatile injection molding machine to introduce a high amplitude vibration force field into the entire injection molding process . As a one step morphology control the vibration force field can drive the dispersed Poly droplets to form the stiff microfibrils to improve the mechanical properties of the high density polyethylene with high melt flow index . HDPE matrix is toughened and reinforced simultaneously under the synergistic effect of VPIM and PET . The impact and yield strengths of the HDPE PET composite sample prepared by VPIM are increased by 696 and 28.5 respectively compared with that of the pure HDPE sample prepared by conventional injection molding . The optimal process frequency is found to be 0.5Hz for the mechanical properties of HDPE PET composite . The phase and impact fractured surface morphologies indicate that the dramatic improvement of the mechanical properties should be attributed to the in situ formation of PET submicron fibrils and hybrid shish kebabs in the intermediate region . The morphological analysis results are verified by DSC DMA 2D WAXD and 2D SAXD tests . From a multi physics perspective the influencing mechanism of the vibration flow field on the morphology is put forward to reveal why the mechanical properties of HDPE PET composite are the best at 0.5Hz .
544,As one of widely used multi functional materials metallic foams are often subjected to multiaxial stress states in practical applications in which the yield behaviors under different stress states need to be better characterized . However it is difficult to conduct multiaxial mechanical tests on foam materials especially under arbitrarily proportional triaxial loadings . In this study numerical modeling of the yield properties of aluminum foam is performed based upon 3D image based models . Real structural models of the Al foam are reconstructed using microscopic X ray computed tomography technique for multiaxial characterization computationally . Numerical simulation reveals that plastic collapse and fracture of cell walls first occur in a relatively weak zone under prescribed uni tri axial loadings whereas happen in the central section under biaxial loadings . An initial yield criterion is defined based upon energy dissipation . A constant stress proportion coefficient can be obtained under the stress controlled triaxial proportional loading and its effectiveness is also validated by comparing the stress strain responses with those under velocity controlled uniaxial and hydrostatic compressive loading . It is found that the initial yield points of foam specimens can be obtained in different stress states in the von Mises mean stress space . The normalized yield surface is approximately independent of relative density and can be well fitted to a parabolic or an elliptic function . Comparisons between the numerical yield surface and three typical theoretical yield criteria suggest that the Deshpande and Fleck s criterion provides more precise predictions than Gibson and Miller yield criteria when a proper plastic Poisson s ratio is adopted . Furthermore it is shown that the early stage yield surface of metallic foams can be evolved in a geometrically self similar manner .

Nickel chloride as a catalyst was applied on the GF fabrics and CNTs were formed in an ethanol flame . Results showed that different carbon materials were synthesised and they were sensitive to the flame synthesis parameters . Short CNTs were dominant with a low catalyst concentration of 0.2mol L and long CNTs started to appear when the catalyst was increased to 0.4 and 0.6mol L. With even higher catalyst concentration at 0.8 and 1.0mol L most of the CNTs were embedded in a thick layer of carbon soot . In addition the thermal and electrical conductivities of GF epoxy and multi scale CNT GF epoxy composites were measured . Compared to GF epoxy composite a more than 40 increase of thermal conductivity and 10 orders of magnitude decrease of electrical resistance were achieved in these multi scale CNT GF epoxy composites .
547,Fibre reinforced polymeric composites bonded with epoxy adhesives often fail ungraciously manifesting fibre tear failure due to the edge peel stresses . This research work proposes phenol formaldehyde based hyperelastic adhesive as a compliant adhesive for tailoring the single lap joints consisting of GFRP adherends and well toughened epoxy adhesive joints . The failure strength of the AF3109 and EA9696 adhesive joints is increased by 51.64 and 24.25 respectively by having 20 volume of compliant adhesive in the bond line . Finite element simulations with Exponential Drucker Prager and Marlow strain energy models are carried out to simulate the experimental load displacement response . Different failure mechanisms and the influence of adhesive intermingling are revealed by the failure analysis . Finally a failure mode map for the tailored adhesive joints is proposed in terms of normalised strength ratio and the normalised volume of the compliant adhesive .

550,The increasingly severe electromagnetic pollution calls for high performance microwave absorption materials . Lightweight robust and porous MXene polyimide aerogels with reversible compressibility anisotropic pressure sensitivity and microwave absorption performances are fabricated by interface reinforcement and bidirectional freezing approach . The interfaces between MXene sheets are effectively reinforced by incorporated polyimide while anisotropic wave like lamellar architectures are constructed during the bidirectional freezing process due to the generated dual temperature gradients . The highly anisotropic aerogel exhibits obvious higher mechanical strength and electrical conductivity along the lamella direction but better elasticity and less energy dissipation in the normal direction . The reversibly compressible porous MP architecture not only delivers steady and repeatable electrical resistance response but also presents long term discernible direction dependent pressure sensitivity for 1000 loading release cycles at a strain of 50 . The anisotropic and porous architecture benefits microwave absorption . The structure optimization yields tunable effective absorption bandwidth in a range of 3.918GHz . Particularly the MP aerogel shows the best EAB of 6.5GHz for reported MXene based microwave absorbers at only 1.91mm and the EAB covers the whole X band for an aerogel with a thickness of 2.57mm . These promising characteristics make the interfacially reinforced anisotropic MXene aerogels applicable for wearable piezoresistive devices and microwave absorbing materials .

552,In this research prediction of mechanical properties of short fiber reinforced composites manufactured with the help of fused filament fabrication process is investigated . Three scale formulation of asymptotic homogenization is employed to upscale the properties from microscale to mesoscale and from mesoscale to macroscale . Since generating microscale representative volume element infused with short fibers requires sophisticated modeling tools the algorithm for the microscale RVE generation is presented and discussed . Homogenization was performed for microscale RVEs with random and aligned fiber orientations and for mesoscale RVEs with unidirectional and 0 90 layup formation . Tensile tests were performed for different short carbon fiber concentrations 5 7.5 and 10 to validate predicted homogenized properties . Moreover to analyze the morphology of 3D printed specimens microstructural analysis using SEM was performed on all the printed specimens . Surface morphology helped to gain more insight into the bead structure and fiber distribution . It was concluded that Young s modulus prediction using random fiber orientation has low relative errors tested in bead direction . Overall this study has unique contribution to mechanical property prediction for FFF made short fiber reinforced composite parts .
553,Metal phenylphosphonate piperazine reduced graphene oxide nanomaterials with different metal centers were facilely synthesized . We found that the morphology of metal organophosphorus was controlled by the coordinated metal centers trivalent metal organophosphorus exhibited nanosheet morphology while divalent metal organophosphorus displayed nanorod morphology . In addition the role of metal centers on the flame safety and mechanical performance of epoxy resin were studied . The limiting oxygen index values of EP composites with only 3wt of additive were increased in different levels and the MPhP PGO EP composites all pass UL 94 V 0 rating which was owing to the multi coordinating effect . Specifically we verified that P element of MPhP PGO could act on both condensed and gas phase while MPhP PGO only acted in the condensed phase thus MPhP PGO EP showed better enhancing effect on flame retardancy of EP . Beyond that MPhP PGO EP displayed more excellent mechanical properties is due to MPhP which had good reinforcement effect to EP matrix .

However only a few studies focus on SR based shape memory materials and the increasing intelligent applications of SR materials are limited by the insufficient strength and poor designable recovery behavior . Herein we report a simple method via monomers prepolymers blend and in situ polymerization cross linking to prepare thermal responsive shape memory silicone rubber composites with three transition temperatures . In the SRCs poly and poly are used as switching segments and reinforced phase polydimethylsiloxane networks provide a third transition and dominate the permanent shape . In a thermal stimulus recovery of SRCs with PMMA and PEMA switching segments are used second temporary shapes can be precisely designed by just tuning the proportions of PMMA and PEMA and a practical linear relationship between recovered scale and PEMA content is built . The shape memory and mechanical properties of SRCs are both enhanced by micro nano particles of PMMA and PEMA . The SRCs present excellent thermal stability hydrophobicity and hygroscopicity . The triple shape memory SRC materials have potential applications in smart materials and actuators .

Herein thermosetting lignin based polyurethanes coatings with superior corrosion resistance and high content of lignin were prepared by polymerization of lignin based polyol with hexamethylene diisocyanate in absence of catalysts . In order to increase the reactivity and solubility of OH EL when reacting with isocyanates the phenolic hydroxyls of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin were selectively converted to primary aliphatic hydroxyls by sequential alkylation and thiol ene reaction . Due to the well dispersion and crosslinking reactivity of OH EL in the polyurethane networks the resulting LPUs presented high thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties . Remarkably LPU 3 with the content of OH EL of 54.8wt exhibited high T
560,We produce balsa based structures by selective removal of lignin . The changes that occur in the main components of balsa upon delignification including tracheids closed pits and tylosis vessels allow the development of mesopores and a substantial increase in fluid permeability . Such system is ideally suited as a support of phase change materials PCM . Vacuum assisted impregnation with polyethylene glycol results in a form stable PCM system . The FPCM displays a high encapsulating capacity at temperatures above the melting PEG transition with a latent heat of 134J g and low supercooling . The results are rationalized by the affinity between the unidirectional mesoporous structure and the PCM polymer involving capillary forces and hydrogen bonding . The leakage proof FPCM outperforms available systems supported on minerals or other wood species . Compared to the latter group the results obtained with balsa relate to its morphology and the effect of residual hemicelluloses in hierarchically aligned cellulose nano and microfibrils . The FPCMs resist compressive loads and performs stably for at least 200 cycles of heating and cooling . An insignificant loss in latent heat is observed compared to that of pure PEG . The phase transition temperature fluctuation and non leaking characteristics under load make the balsa based FPCM a superior alternative for passive heating cooling especially for uses at high ambient temperatures . The reversible thermoregulatory capacity low cost high efficiency renewability and operability of the balsa supported FPCM indicate an excellent option for thermal energy storage and conversion devices .

This FML is made of a special 3D fiberglass fabric epoxy composite which also hosts a two part liquid urethane foam within its core cavities and further reinforced with basalt and E glass bidirectional fabrics . 3D FML panels with six different configurations were fabricated and beam like specimens were extracted from the panels .

This follow up study focuses on investigating the effects and level of improvement in the performance of the 3D FMLs by utilizing magnesium and stainless steel as the face sheet materials and the enhancement gained by the basalt and E glass fabrics . The responses of the 3D FMLs are also simulated numerically . By comparing the numerical and experimental results it will be explicitly demonstrated that the developed FE framework could serve as an effective and accurate means for establishing the performance of such FMLs including those with more complex geometries and loading conditions . In addition the most effective 3D FMLs are identified and ranked based on their buckling capacity with respect to their cost and weight .

These results make the approach developed in this manuscript very attractive in the design of advanced biocomposites with optimized fire retardancy and mechanical properties .
563,In recent years there are many ways to improve the energy storage performance of polymer based dielectric capacitors especially by filling ceramic fillers into polymer matrix . However the improvement of capacity is always limited by the structural defects due to poor interface compatibility between inorganic fillers and organic matrix .

The effects of incorporation content on the microstructure and electrical properties have been studied . The results show that the ZrO segments are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix which can facilitate the dipole orientation and reduces dielectric loss leading to increase of energy storage density . To further improve the performances of hybrid PVTC the linear dielectric polyimide is introduced for constructing bilayer films with hybrid PVTC in mesoscopic structure .

567,A novel inverse identification method using only a single tensile specimen for obtaining four anisotropic elastic constants of fiber reinforced composites sheet is proposed in this study . The method is based on virtual fields method for solving weak form equilibrium equation with an optimized tension type non standard specimen specially designed with an elliptic hole at the center of the specimen . Full field strain measured by a digital image correlation technique is applied as experimental strain fields which are used as inputs of the VFM . For optimizing the tension type VFM specimen finite element analysis is conducted as a virtual experiment to generate ideal strain fields . The determined tension type VFM specimen has an elliptic hole with 45 inclined to the loading direction which is optimized from the error analysis between the FE input and VFM calculated material constants . For the validation of the proposed approach experiments are performed with unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced plastic sheets . The comparison of VFM identified anisotropic constants to those determined from the standard tensile tests with three different orientated samples shows satisfactory accuracy ranging between 5.94 and 0.71 errors which confirm the validity of the new inverse method for the characterization of anisotropic elasticity of composites sheets .

However these fibers exhibit large anisotropies in the radial and axial directions . In addition limited data has been reported on the elastic properties of fibers in other directions than longitudinal and transversal directions and on the relationship between elastic properties and fiber structures . In this study we prepared five epoxy composites each containing a different type of carbon fiber and used a nanoindentation method in combination with finite element analysis to investigate five elastic constants of the carbon fibers . The results demonstrate that the crystallite size and the orientation of its graphite crystal inclusions affect the elastic constants
570,Thermosetting polymers and composites featuring chemical cross linking are usually regarded as unrecyclable . Recently novel thermosets containing dynamic chemical bonds or labile bonds have been developed to achieve chemical recycling under mild conditions via solvent assisted exchange or cleavage reactions . This concept has been extended to recycle conventional thermosets and composites using a proper catalyst solvent system by selective bond cleavage . In this paper we develop a modeling framework to probe into the complicated reaction diffusion coupling and reveal the effect of reinforcement such as carbon fiber on the dissolution process of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy . A model involving chemical species concentration dependent diffusion and reaction rates is developed to inquire into the evolution of different functional group concentrations and network structure via solvent assisted exchange reactions . We further apply the reaction diffusion based model to a multiphase structure to simulate the CFRE dissolution process . The model is experimentally validated by the mass evolution of a virgin cured epoxy anhydride resin matrix in an alcohol catalyst solution proceeding with transesterification . The established model can predict the influence of dissolution processing parameters including catalyst concentration and solvent diffusivity . Parametric studies are used to further assess the structural parameters of fiber loading on the dissolution rate . This work provides a deep understanding on the dissolution of thermosets and their fiber reinforced composites and can guide the future engineering application of sustainable recycling approaches of thermosets and composites .

572,Protein is an ideal alternative to many synthetic components in green and bio electronic products due to its natural abundance high flexibility and excellent biocompatibility . Here we report the development of new renewable thermal management materials based on a stable composite system of biocompatible silk fibroin protein with a small amount of AlN inclusions . The self assembly of AlN particles and SF was promoted by water annealing to enhance the hydrogen bonding between the phases to reduce the phonon scattering at the interface . The synthesized protein composites have excellent thermal stability high mechanical durability and low linear expansion related in part to the secondary structure of silk protein which can be modulated by changing the AlN content . The physical properties were analyzed and modeled within effective medium theory and the agreements were reasonable except for the thermal conductivity which was surprisingly much larger than predicted by the model which is attributed to the strong interaction between protein and AlN the high thermal conductivity of AlN and the continuous network of AlN particles that formed at higher concentrations . This makes proteins excellent candidates for thermally conductive composite materials which have many emerging applications in implantable biomedical devices flexible and sustainable sensors and green heat transfer products .
573,A three dimensional Finite Element Analysis model incorporating an elastic plastic damage model which was implemented as a user defined material sub routine in a FEA code is developed to simulate the impact response of carbon fibre reinforced plastic composites . The model predicts the load versus time and the load versus displacement responses of the composite during the impact event . Further it predicts the extent shape and direction of any intralaminar damage and interlaminar delaminations i.e . interlaminar cracking as a function of the depth through the thickness of the impacted CFRP test specimen as well as the extent of permanent indention caused by the impactor striking the composite plate . To validate the model experimental results are obtained from relatively low velocity impact tests on CFRP plates employing either a matrix of a thermoplastic polymer i.e . poly or a thermosetting epoxy polymer . The 3 D EP model that has been developed is shown to model successfully the experimentally measured impact behaviour of the CFRP composites .

In this regard a host matrix of gadolinium doped cerium pyrophosphate has been reinforced by cesium pentahydrogen diphosphate to deliver dense electrolyte material . The composite electrolyte materials were formulated with different compositions and examined for the phase purity sinterability functional group and electrical conductivities . It was found that the reinforcement by CPP assisted formation of a core shell structure which accelerated the proton migration by the acidic dissolution of proton into the shell . This acidic dissolution fastens the kinetics of hydrolysis of the electrolyte resulting in a maximum ionic conductivity of about 9mScm
578,High performance polymer fibers have broad applications in composites due to high strength and excellent toughness . However the enhancement in tensile strength often results in a decrease in elongation at break and simultaneous increase of strength and toughness is still challenging for aramid fiber . Herein an effective method based on relaxation time theory is proposed to simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and elongation at break for heterocyclic aramid fiber . Ultra high molecular weight heterocyclic aramid was added in the heterocyclic aramid spinning dope to prepare fibers . The structure evolution of fiber is studied in detail combining with experiment and simulation . Results of Molecular Dynamics simulations prove that HMPBIA acts as a role of mainstay by maintaining straight chain conformation in highly oriented fibers . This unique mainstay body structure weaken slippage between molecular chains when the fiber is subject to tension . Further characterizations by small angle X ray scattering and scanning electron microscope confirm the formation of mainstay body structure in the fiber which improves tensile strength and elongation at break by 17.7 and 16.7 respectively .
579,In many previous studies on humidity sensors based on composites embedded with conductive nanofillers opposite dependence of their electrical resistance on humidity has been reported . In this study we systematically investigate the origin of opposite humidity dependence of the resistance of agarose carbon nanotube composites as a model composite material . Experimental results and impedance analysis reveal that the composites with more conductive fillers present positive dependence of resistance on humidity as an electronic pathway through the well connected fillers is preferred for electrical conduction . In contrast the composites with low filler content show negative dependence as the ionic pathway is more dominant for electrical conduction . The corresponding equivalent circuits for the nanofiller embedded composites are suggested and the expected Nyquist plots depending on the filler content and humidity conditions are discussed . The process based on the impedance analysis potentially allows for non destructive analysis of compositions and electrical property of composites as well as highly sensitive humidity detection .

581,We present a nonlinear multiscale modeling and simulation framework for the mechanical design of machine knitted textiles with functionally graded microstructures . The framework operates on the mesoscale where yarns intermesh into stitch patterns and the macroscale where these repetitive stitch patterns are composed into a fabric . On the mesoscale representative unit cells consisting of single interlocked yarn loops modeled as geometrically exact nonlinear elastic 3D beams are homogenized to compute their effective mechanical properties . From this data a B Spline response surface model is generated to represent the nonlinear orthotropic constitutive behavior on the macroscale where the fabric is modeled by a nonlinear KirchhoffLove shell formulation and discretized using isogeometric finite elements . These functionally graded textiles with locally varying properties can be designed and analyzed by parameterizing the stitch value i.e . the loop length of a single jersey stitch and the knitting direction as mesoscopic design variables of the macroscopic response surface constitutive model . To validate the multiscale simulation and design approach numerical results are compared against physical experiments of different tensile loading cases for various grading scenarios . Furthermore the versatility of the method for the design of functionally graded textiles is demonstrated .

In this research an organic inorganic hybrid strategy to prepare flame retardant PMMA with satisfying thermal stability mechanical properties and transparency is reported . A new reactive phosphorus containing monomer is copolymerized with methyl methacrylate to provide flame retardant function and meanwhile octa vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane serves as a reinforcer is chemically combined with the copolymer . The organic inorganic hybrid copolymerized nanocomposite with 10mol MDP and 0.5mol V POSS shows significantly enhanced limiting oxygen index decreased heat release rate compared with PMMA . The flame retardant mechanisms are analyzed and discussed in detail . Additionally its initial decomposition temperature is increased by 42C showing higher thermal stability . The terpolymer also exhibits greatly improved mechanical property due to the introduction of V POSS and its tensile strength young s modulus and impact strength are much higher than those of MMA MDP copolymer . Finally it also keeps good optical property comparable to PMMA . As a result Our research provides an effective way to prepare intrinsic flame retardant PMMA with good comprehensive performance .
583,One component epoxy adhesives in which the epoxy resin and curing agent are premixed have many commercial advantages including reduced working time and stable performance . However these adhesives suffer from a short shelf life even at room temperature . Here core shell structured curing agents were prepared via a dry particle coating process that improved the storage stability of one component epoxy adhesives . The DPC process is a simple economic and solvent free method to fabricate core shell structured materials using mechanical forces . Graphene nanoplatelets were used as encapsulating materials due to their high thermal conductivity and large surface areas . With the GNP encapsulated curing agents a one component epoxy adhesive displayed significantly enhanced storage stability while maintaining its fast curing behavior . In particular the pot life of the adhesive increased to 60 days which is over two times longer than that of a pristine epoxy adhesive . The curing temperature increased by up to 5.6C which is a smaller increase than that observed when non thermally conductive materials were used for encapsulation . Furthermore the GNPs provided reinforcement in the cured epoxy adhesive thereby improving the lap shear strength by 2030 .
584,A novel material and process was developed using fibre reinforced powder epoxy to produce unidirectional towpreg with a pilot scale towpregging line for cost effective production of large composite structures for the renewable energy market specifically for wind and tidal turbine blades . Electrostatic attraction was used to coat fibre tows with powder epoxy and either joule or radiant heating employed to heat and melt the polymer followed by consolidation between rollers . Unidirectional carbon fibre and basalt fibre reinforced polymer laminates were manufactured from the towpreg . Tensile test results showed that the towpregging process could be employed to achieve high performance UD CFRP with 0 tensile properties that are similar or better than commercially available UD CFRP systems . The competitive advantages of the powder epoxy towpreg system include lower cost better overall manufacturing control for vacuum bag only manufacturing and the ability to co cure parts together at a later stage . Mechanical test results showed some variation between two types of UD BFRP but the results compared well with published data on UD BFRP and equivalent glass fibre reinforced polymer systems . Finally the influence of hygrothermal ageing due to water immersion on the tensile properties of the materials was investigated with tests revealing that the water ageing effect was more severe in the case of UD BFRP than for UD CFRP .
585,Simple self healing behavior of polymers that respond to multiple physicochemical stimuli are highly desirable for industrial applications . In this study under various external environmental stimulating factors we focus on the self healing kinetics of polymer bilayer films comprising a colorless polyimide bottom substrate layer and linseed oil loaded microcapsule embedded polydimethylsiloxane upper healing layer . The experimental results showed clear correlation between stimulating factors and the healing time . Although the crack healing behavior of PBF with 5wt microcapsule under air atmosphere is fairly slow it has an improved healing effect at the artificial crack interface heating to 70C moreover gradual healing is observed by moisture absorption in environments with relative humidity of 70 . Remarkably we found that ultraviolet light irradiation through the 5wt LOMC filled PDMS layer triggers a noticeable kinematic advantage for the drying reaction that initiates interfacial self healing . Short time UV irradiated PBF 5wt exhibits a low water vapor permeability of 35.4gm
586,This paper describes a manufacturing method for the ribs of a cylindrical anisogrid composite structure without an outer skin . This research presents two direct compression techniques for the ribs during wet filament winding with T700 continuous carbon fiber tows . In addition the strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed compression process was compared to that of the manufactured rib that did not use the compression process . The average compressive strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed methods is 394 Mpa and 247MPa according to the failure mode respectively . Although the ribs manufactured using the proposed method did not show increase in strength decreases in the standard deviation for both compressive failure modes and was observed . Thus the proposed compression techniques resulted in compression strength stabilizing thanks to decreasing void content . Furthermore structural stiffness was indirectly evaluated and it was found that the improvement was over 150 .

589,The current research presents a first attempt to manufacture thermoplastic tubular composites using carbon fibre as reinforcement and an innovative Elium resin as the matrix material using Bladder Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding manufacturing process . The manufacturing process parameters required to achieve a fully impregnated thermoplastic composites were established and the parts have undergone impact flexure and vibration damping tests . The mechanical properties and the failure modes are compared with the tubes manufactured with conventional epoxy matrix . During impact testing thermoplastic tubular composites have shown 16.3 and 18.9 higher peak load and major damage energy respectively compared to carbon epoxy tubes . They have also shown distinctive failure modes with acrylic Elium composites tubes undergoing more ductile and spreaded failure whilst epoxy composites have shown brittle and catastrophic failure . Flexural tests have shown comparable load carrying capability higher strain to failure and less delamination for carbon Elium composites compared to carbon epoxy composites . These are attributed to the presence of microductlilty and other associated matrix deformation features shown during the fractographic analysis of carbon Elium composites . Vibration modal analysis tests have shown 21.7 higher structural damping for carbon Elium composite measured at different output locations on the tube . The differences in the failure mechanisms and the underlying reasons for the improvement shown by thermoplastic Elium composite tubes under different mechanical tests are deliberated in this paper .
590,Interface engineering and phase engineering of composites offer a promising route to rationally tune the interlaminar toughness of laminates as high toughness plays an important role in preventing interlaminar failure and ensuring the safety of components . Herein unlike the previous melt mixing process we coated the second reinforcement TONFC on the surface of the main reinforcement by sol impregnation and successfully prepared the commingled yarn random polypropylene composite laminate with high interlaminar fracture toughness . The surface groups of each raw material of the composite system before and after the reaction were characterized and thereby obtaining the interface strengthening mechanism . Besides the heterogeneous nucleation effect of TONFC and the mechanism of inducing phase formation were revealed by analysis of crystallization behavior and crystal structure . Further through a double cantilever beam test and morphology analysis the effect mechanism of the addition of TONFC on the interlaminar crack propagation of PPR composite laminate was explored . This work provides a rapid and efficient avenue for the interlaminar modification of commingled yarn composites .
591,A fundamental understanding of pure shear failure is important in elucidating the failure characteristics of woven thermoplastic composites . This work presents a novel S specimen design and an associated methodology for testing pure in plane shear failure in composites . The technique has been experimentally tested with woven thermoplastic composites which have complex failure evolution in shear due to their weave architecture . Four different composites were considered to demonstrate the scope of the technique application with various combinations of weave matrix and fibre . A Digital Image Correlation system integrated with the hemispherical testing device validated that shear strain was the dominant strain in the failure region . From this work it is evident that shear failure morphology varies between the tested composites based on the differences in their weave architecture and fibre and matrix properties . Additional Finite Element Analysis showed that neither bending nor friction hindered the tests ability to produce pure shear in the specimen . This new shear specimen provides a means of inducing shear failure utilising the hemispherical dome apparatus currently used for composite forming studies and failure analysis of other deformation modes between uniaxial and equi biaxial tension .
592,This paper relates with the assignment of trucks to time slots in container terminals equipped with Truck Appointment Systems . A two phase approach is provided first export and import containers are matched in tuples with a clustering analysis to reduce the number of empty trips and then tuples are assigned to time slots to minimize trucks deviation from their preferred time slots and truck turnaround times . Real case instances related to Mexican and Italian container terminals are tested . Results show that our approach reduces empty truck trips up to 33.79 and that it can be successfully applied to any container terminal .
593,This paper develops the laden and empty container supply chain model based on three scenarios that differ with regard to tardiness in the return of empty containers and the decision process for the imposition of detention charges with the goal of determining optimal devanning times . The effectiveness of each type of policy centralized versus decentralized is determined through computational experiments that produce key performance measures including the on time return ratio . Useful managerial insights on the implementation of these polices are derived from the results of sensitivity analyses .
594,Battery electric buses are rapidly being embraced by public transit agencies because of their environmental and economic benefits . To address the problems of limited driving range and time consuming charging for BEBs manufacturers have developed rapid on route charging technology that utilizes typical layovers at terminals to charge buses in operation using high power . With on route fast charging BEBs are as capable as their diesel counterparts in terms of range and operating time . However on route fast charging makes it more challenging to schedule and manage charging events for a BEB system . First on route fast charging may lead to high electricity power demand charges . Second it may increase electricity energy charges because of charging that occurs during on peak hours . Without careful charging scheduling and management on route fast charging may significantly increase fuel costs and reduce the economic attractiveness of BEBs . The present study proposes a network modeling framework to optimize the charging scheduling and management for a fast charging BEB system effectively minimizing total charging costs . The charging schedule determines when to charge a BEB while the charging management strategically controls the actual charging power . Charging costs include both electricity demand charges and energy charges . The charging scheduling and management problem is first formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex program with time continuous variables . A discretizing method and a linear reformulation technique are then adopted to reformulate the model as a linear program which can be easily solved using off the shelf solvers even for large scale problems . Finally the model is demonstrated with extensive numerical studies based on two real world bus networks . The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively determine the optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast charging BEB system which carries the potential for use in large scale real world bus networks .
595,In this paper we will study a typical problem in inland container shipping concerning the barge transportation of maritime containers between a dry port and a set of seaport terminals . The barges depart from the dry port and visit a set of sea terminals where containers need either to be dropped off or picked up . The goal is to achieve economies of scale with barges and avoid trucking as much as possible . The decision thus involves finding the best allocation of containers to barges in order to guarantee on time delivery and meet capacity restrictions . The problem will be modeled as a variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries coupled with time features . The model includes parameters that can be tuned to improve barge utilization and travelling distance . A hybrid local search meta heuristic algorithm combined with a branch and cut solver will be developed to solve the model . Numerical experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm and provide solution analysis for practical insights . Real world data has been collected from a local barge operator based in the Port of Rotterdam region and will be used as input for the experiments . This will result in an in depth analysis into current planning practices . The proposed framework complements existing models in the literature and contributes to the development of a comprehensive set of decision support tools which help in the decision making process for inland terminals .
596,We propose a consistent information flow to integrate Interval Travel Times into a city logistics vehicle routing problem with satellites . The consistent information flow encompasses the derivation of ITT the usage of ITT in robust shortest path computation and the integration of ITT into robust vehicle routing . Based on the results of the information flow robust meeting times of first tier and second tier vehicles are created . We evaluate the approach with large real world traffic data sets . We observe that the integration of ITT leads to first tier routes that are reasonably efficient and robust .
597,One innovative solution to the last mile delivery problem is the self service locker system . Motivated by a real case in Singapore we consider a POP Locker Alliance who operates a set of POP stations and wishes to improve the last mile delivery by opening new locker facilities . We propose a quantitative approach to determine the optimal locker location with the objective to maximize the overall service provided by the alliance . Customers choices regarding the use of facilities are explicitly considered . They are predicted by a multinomial logit model . We then formulate the location problem as a multi ratio linear fractional 01 program and provide two solution approaches . The first one is to reformulate the original problem as a mixed integer linear program which is further strengthened using conditional McCormick inequalities . This approach is an exact method developed for small scale problems . For large scale problems we propose an alternating algorithm i.e . Quadratic Transform with Linear Alternating . The numerical experiment indicates that QT LA is an efficient approach that yields high quality solutions . Finally we conducted a case study . The results highlighted the importance of considering the customers choices . Under different parameter values of the multinomial logit model the decisions could be completely different . Therefore the parameter value should be carefully estimated in advance .
598,This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks . In this problem there are healthcare treatment and disposal centers . Locations of healthcare centers are known however it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment recycling and disposal centers . Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non infectious wastes . Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment . The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times . In this respect transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables . As transferring time increases it is more likely for the contamination to spread . Having visited a treatment center infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment . This research develops a bi objective mixed integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem . The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination simultaneously . Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution . This study also develops a Multi Objective Water Flow like Algorithm which is a
599,This paper investigates the transshipment operations between vessels and trains in seaport rail terminals . In order to get a more effective transshipment plan the schedule plan of trains and the transshipment plan of containers among vessels yards and trains are determined simultaneously . To this end a mixed integer programming model is proposed to integrate the two sub problems with the objective of minimizing the total operation cost in which the service time window and unloading time requirement of trains are considered . It is demonstrated that some variables in the model can be relaxed without influencing the optimal result . Moreover a set of valid inequalities are introduced to tighten the constraints . The result experiments show that the enhanced model can be solved more effectively . Then extensive experiments have been conducted to analyze the influence of several factors including the handling capacity the yard capacity and the value of unit cost . The results report that the handling capacity shows a significant effect on the performance of the transfer plan and increasing the storage cost of import containers leads to a more effective transshipment plan .
600,An effective way to solve the parking difficulty is to utilize idle private parking slots as temporary parking supplies under the shared parking mode . A platform based management approach can make reasonable use of parking slots by gathering the parking time windows of owners and consumers in advance . However the actual parking time is difficult to be consistent with that registered on the platform . Owners and consumers may be unpunctual when arriving and departing . The parking unpunctuality is a stochastic factor and affects the allocation of parking slots . This paper focuses on how to model and optimize the parking unpunctuality in the shared parking slot allocation problem . We formulate the parking probability function of consumers and owners in different time slots and transform the stochastic programming model into an expectation model . It is found that in a certain time slot the optimal number of idle parking slot reserved is related to the probability of unpunctuality as well as the number of cars registered to arrive and depart in the neighboring time slots . The numerical experiments indicate that when considering the parking unpunctuality the allocation is less compact the satisfaction of consumers is decreased especially when the supply is limited or the consumer demands are excessive . In the middle and later periods throughout the daytime parking slots are more likely to be overloaded .
601,This paper examines CSR in fashion supply chains by applying a multi methodological approach . We first investigate the CSR performance and consumer expectation towards luxury fast fashion and functional brands through a case study and semi structure interviews . Then by building a stylized analytical model we uncover that it is optimal for the higher priced fast fashion and functional brands to commit a high CSR commitment with a low advertisement level while the luxury brands should act oppositely . To entice the luxury fashion brand to create a CSR improving situation we propose the use of disruptive technologies such as blockchain to help .
602,This paper studies a luxury sporting goods supply chain experiencing trade disruption and market volatility . We propose a flexible trade credit contract with minimum order quantity and design a coordination mechanism between a supplier and a loss averse wholesaler . We extend our study to a multi tiered product setting and examine the impacts of social influences and loss aversion on SC decisions and channel coordination . Given the gloomy post Covid 19 economic prospects in an era of reglobalization this study urges trade associations and business leaders to immunize their SCs by considering behavioral biases and social influences and revisiting their contractual obligations .
603,As the sharing economy has grown rapidly in recent years luxury fashion rental has become a prominent business trend . An increasing number of designer brands are finding ways to cooperate with rental platforms rather than compete with them . We develop a stylized model to study the impact of business to consumer product sharing on luxury fashion brands . Specifically we consider a setting where a designer brand firm provides a luxury fashion product to a rental platform which can either purchase the product from the firm then rent to consumers or allow the designer brand firm to use its platform to reach the consumers directly with a commission fee . Our analysis reveals that the presence of a rental platform leads to two simultaneous effects a market expansion effect and a cannibalization effect . In the base model we show that the market expansion effect dominates the cannibalization effect . Therefore the designer brand firm can benefit from the appearance of a rental platform . Further our analysis reveals that the optimal choice between the wholesale and agency contract of the firm and the platform depends critically on two parameters the revenue sharing proportion and salvage value . We illustrate that when the revenue sharing proportion is relatively large and salvage value is relatively small both the firm and the platform benefit more under the agency contract . Moreover we illustrate the robustness of our main insights to consider the presence of different consumer segments consumers conspicuous behavior competition between rental platforms and two period rental setting .
604,We examine the value of blockchain for disclosing secondhand product quality in a supply chain in which contributors consign secondhand products to an online platform that resells them and competes with suppliers of new products . We find that the platform is more likely to provide a uniform pricing strategy with new products when the revenue sharing portion of the consignment contract is sufficiently low . Moreover surprisingly without blockchain the platform prefers moderately perceived and true quality secondhand products instead of extremely high or low quality . With blockchain the platform prefers selling low uniqueness and low quality secondhand products . Furthermore we find that with blockchain horizontal integration is more effective in improving the supply chains total profit . A win win win outcome can be achieved for the platform the supplier and consumers in a supply chain that sells low uniqueness products .
605,Blockchain is a technology with unique combination of features such as decentralized structure distributed notes and storage mechanism consensus algorithm smart contracting and asymmetric encryption to ensure network security transparency and visibility . Blockchain has immense potential to transform supply chain functions from SC provenance business process reengineering to security enhancement . More and more studies exploring the use of blockchain in SCs have appeared in recent years . In this paper we consider a total of 178 articles and examine all the relevant research done in the field associated with the use of blockchain integration in SC operations . We highlight the corresponding opportunities possible societal impacts current state of the art technologies along with major trends and challenges . We examine several industrial sectors such as shipping manufacturing automotive aviation finance technology energy healthcare agriculture and food e commerce and education among others that can be successfully revamped with blockchain based technologies through enhanced visibility and business process management . A future research agenda is established which lays the solid foundation for further studies on this important emerging research area .
606,Network theory has provided key insights into the overall resilience of air transportation systems . We expand upon these insights by using Mahalanobis distance to quantify delay abnormalities complex network metrics for high level insights and a hybrid method that combines data driven and network approaches . We apply these methods to public data and discuss trends in resilience among four US airlines . We find that our data driven methods enable more detailed insights into airline resilience than traditional network methods . We also find that simultaneously considering all three approaches provides a more comprehensive understanding of resilience than the consideration of any one in isolation .
607,This paper models a single allocation multi commodity hub and spoke network problem through a bi objective mathematical model considering the congestion in both hubs and connection links . A novel aggregation model is developed based on a general GI G c queuing system to evaluate the congestion of the flow of the multiple products in the hubs . The proposed model is then solved using a novel learning based metaheuristic based on NSGA II
608,In China rapid development of online food delivery brings massive orders which relies heavily on deliverymen riding e bikes . In practice actual delivery routes of most orders are not the same as the system recommended routes and the road network information for some areas is outdated or incomplete . In this research we develop a deep inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to capture deliverymens preferences from historical GPS trajectories and recommend their preferred routes . Considering the characteristics of food delivery routes we employ Dijkstras algorithm instead of value iteration to determine the current policy and compute the gradient of IRL . Moreover we plan routes at the presence and absence of road network information providing accurate navigation when road network information is unknown . Numerical experiments on real delivery trajectories provided by Meituan Dianping Group show that our approach improves
609,Container ports play an important role in global logistics and supply chains by providing container handling services for container ships . In a port container ships usually need the assistance of tugboats in order to undergo berthing shifting and unberthing movements . Effective scheduling of the tugboats for serving the ships is thus of great importance for ensuring safe and efficient container ship movements in a port . However research on tugboat scheduling is scarce in the literature . We contribute to the literature by studying a real life tugboat scheduling problem . We formulate the Tug SP using a mixed integer linear programming model taking into consideration various practical constraints . In view of the specific problem structure we further develop six families of valid inequalities to strengthen the MILP model . To efficiently solve the Tug SP we develop a tailored branch and cut algorithm by incorporating these valid inequalities into a standard branch and bound solution framework . We evaluate the computational performance of the proposed branch and cut algorithm using a set of test instances generated from real life ship traffic data collected from the Port of Singapore . The computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed valid inequalities and show that the branch and cut algorithm can optimally solve instances of realistic sizes with a reasonable amount of computation time .
610,We consider a firm producing and selling experience products over two periods with private quality information . Consumers strategically decide their purchasing timing driven by the imitation effect and the firm chooses pricing policy and equilibrium type . Results imply that the firm prefers preannounced pricing but consumers prefer dynamic pricing . Under both pricing schemes the first period price decreases but the second period price increases with the imitation effect . A pooling pooling equilibrium is always preferred unless the firm is farsighted and the imitation effect is weak under dynamic pricing .
611,Dynamic macroeconomic conditions and non binding truckload freight contracts enable both shippers and carriers to behave opportunistically . We present an empirical analysis of carrier reciprocity in the US truckload transportation sector to demonstrate whether consistent performance and fair pricing by shippers when markets are in their favor result in maintained primary carrier tender acceptance when markets turn . The results suggest carriers have short memories they do not remember shippers previous period pricing tendering behavior or performance when making freight acceptance decisions . However carriers appear to be myopic and respond to shippers current market period behaviors ostensibly without regard to shippers previous behaviors .
612,This paper compares the efficiency of two relocation methods in a one way station based electric car sharing system . First an operator based model is considered where relocations are managed by a dedicated crew . This is compared to a user based model where price incentives are used to balance demand and supply . Two types of pricing schemes are investigated A trip based and a station based scheme . The
613,Optimizing the duration of delivery tours is a crucial issue in urban logistics . In most cases travel times between locations are considered as constant for the whole optimization horizon . Making these travel times time dependent is particularly relevant in real urban traffic environments as traffic conditions and thus travel speeds vary according to the time of the day . In this paper we review the literature on time dependent routing problems with a specific focus on benchmarks and performance criteria used to experimentally evaluate the interest of exploiting time dependent data showing the lack of studies on the impact of spatio temporal features of the benchmark on solutions . Hence we introduce a new benchmark produced from a realistic traffic flow micro simulation of Lyon city allowing us to consider different levels of spatial granularity
614,We study request acceptance dynamics in same day delivery systems by formulating the Dynamic Dispatch Waves Problem with Immediate Acceptance which models integrated management and distribution for dynamically arriving customer requests . We consider an e commerce platform that attempts to serve most customers with same day delivery service . When a shopper attempts to place an order a decision is made immediately to offer same day delivery service or to deny service . Accepted requests are not available for immediate dispatch they must be processed before they are loaded for delivery . Vehicle routes are updated dynamically and serve each accepted delivery request no later than the end of the service day . In this work we limit the study to the case of a single vehicle serving requests potentially using multiple trips from the distribution center . The objective is to make request acceptance and distribution decisions that minimize the expected sum of vehicle travel costs and penalties for service denials . We develop a framework for dynamic decision policies over continuous time for such systems where a feasible vehicle dispatch plan is redesigned and used to guide decisions over time . We design methods for determining an initial optimal
615,In order to increase the order picking efficiency e commerce retailers have started to implement order picking systems where mobile robots carry inventory pods to pick stations . In pick stations pickers pick the products from inventory pods and put them in customer bins . In such a robotic mobile fulfillment center pickers are constantly busy with picking customer orders and avoid non value adding activities such as walking to reach storage locations . To fulfill customer orders each robot needs to complete a sequence of missions and each mission includes a set of retrieval requests . We study the operational problem of scheduling a mobile robot fulfilling a set of customer orders from a pick station . The mobile robot needs to bring each pod from a retrieval location to the pick station and return the pod to a storage location . The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the robot which can be considered as a proxy for other objectives such a shorter lead time higher throughput and less capital investment . We formulate the basic problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem . We then extend the model by adding general precedence constraints to give different priorities to customer orders based on their urgency . We also study a variation of the problem where the pod can be stored in multiple alternative locations . In this case we model the problem as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem . An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is developed to efficiently solve real size instances . The method outperforms the heuristics commonly used in practice .
616,Multi modal transportation takes advantage of multiple transport modes and can be an effective way to ease the negative environmental effects of freight transportation . This paper addresses a multi modal distribution network design problem with the aim of balancing the trade off between economic and environmental benefits . The distribution network that we consider includes both transportation with trucks and ships . We propose a new mixed integer programming model which decides the optimal design of the system i.e . how many ships of each type to use their corresponding routes and sailing speeds . It also suggests an optimal cargo flow through the maritime and road based network . We show how the MIP model can be used to provide decision support through a case study from the distribution of automobiles in India which has a vast coastline that can be used for maritime transportation . Environmental emissions from automobile transportation in India have been rapidly increasing in recent years with the fast economic development and it has become a major contributor to regional air pollution and road congestion . One possible way to ease these negative environmental consequences is to consider a modal shift where some of the automobile transportation from the production facilities located close to the coastline is replaced by roll on roll off ships . Our study shows that multi modal distribution is both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial especially if more industrial players can collaborate to create economies of scale .
617,Expected to operate in the imminent future air taxi service is an aerial on demand transport for a single passenger or a small group of riders which seeks to transform the method of everyday commute . This uncharted territory in the emerging transportation world is anticipated to enable consumers bypass traffic congestion in urban road networks . By adopting an electric vertical takeoff and landing concept air taxis could be operational from skyports retrofitted on building rooftops thus gaining advantage from an implementation standpoint . Motivated by the potential impact of ATS this study provides a review of air taxi systems and associated operations . We first discuss the current developments in the ATS . Next we anticipate potential future challenges of ATS from an operations management perspective and review the existing literature that could be leveraged to tackle these problems . Finally we detail future research opportunities in the air taxi domain .
618,Pricing and package size decisions are critical to the success or failure of reward based crowdfunding projects the importance of these decisions has been overlooked in the existing crowdfunding literature . In this paper we develop a two period model to study pricing and package size decisions in a crowdfunding game where a creator sells perishable products to sequentially arriving consumers . Consumers are heterogeneous in their usages and valuations and they get utility by consuming products rather than owning them . The creator can choose to provide a product menu that contains two types of packages or only provide one type of package to match the consumers usages and valuations . The project would succeed only when the project target is achieved during the funding period otherwise the transaction would be canceled . We show that consumers usages and valuations have a large impact on deciding the creators optimal pricing strategy and project target regardless of whether the exogenous or endogenous package sizes are used . In addition market outcomes depend not only on the optimal pricing strategy but also on the optimal project target . Moreover the creator can benefit from providing two types of packages instead of one type of package . Finally the creator can strategically reduce the size of the large package and narrow the gap between the two packages to attract more funds .
619,This paper investigates the optimal pricing strategies of domestic imported electric vehicle manufacturer and the governments optimal decisions by developing the game theoretic models . The results show that the technology spillover caused by introducing IEVs into domestic markets can affect the profits of electric vehicle manufacturers and the governments decisions on subsidies and tariffs . In addition implementing the subsidy and tariff policies can help to improve the profit of the domestic electric vehicle manufacturer and the social welfare . Moreover when the degree of technology spillover is relatively large implementing the subsidy and tariff policies can also help to improve the consumer surplus .
620,Quantity discounts are a common pricing mechanism to stimulate large orders . We explore their impact on the dynamic behaviour of production and distribution systems by studying key operational and economic metrics . In a three echelon supply chain we observe that the discount generally increases the Bullwhip Effect which especially harms the manufacturer . The discount also reduces the retailers purchase costs but increases its inventory and capacity related costs . A key trade off thus emerges which manifests itself through a U shaped relationship between the total cost and the discount acceptance parameter . In the light of this trade off we discuss how key factors should affect the retailers willingness to pursue the discount . We observe that managers that need to deal with tougher environmental conditions such as high demand uncertainty and long lead times should be less reluctant to increase orders up to the discount quantity . We also discuss in detail other valuable insights for professionals both from the perspective of sellers and buyers .
621,This special issue explores new practices and applications in logistics and supply chain management for luxury goods . This editorial note summarizes the discussions on different important topics including sustainability sourcing advertising behavioral consideration product sharing and channel management among other aspects .
622,Quick response systems which aim to respond promptly to market changes by postponing inventory decisions with a reduced lead time are critical to support fast fashion operations . Under QR systems in the digital data analytics era the fashion brand can acquire market information using digital technologies to improve demand forecasting . This enhances the respective ordering and transportation mode selection decisions . It is known that to implement QR systems requires the availability of the right logistics option and the needed logistics capacity in the future . An Internet based elastic logistics platform hence emerges to help . In this paper in the main model we analytically derive via stochastic dynamic programming the optimal transportation option selection and inventory ordering policy with the ELP . We further examine the value of ELP and identify the situations in which it is especially beneficial to adopt it . Robustness checking is conducted which proves that the theoretical findings derived in the main model are solid . Specific managerial action plans and managerial implications are developed .
623,Financial leasing has become a common solution to financing problems encountered by firms . The main difference between FL and some conventional supply chain financing strategies is the separation of ownership and the right of use of the equipment products . This paper studies a service supply chain that consists of a capital constrained downstream firm that provides service to consumers and an upstream firm that manufactures the equipment needed during the service process . The downstream firm has three alternative financing solutions including FL bank credit financing and trade credit financing . In this study game theoretical models are constructed to analyze and compare the optimal prices order quantities and profits in different financing scenarios . Results corroborate that FL outperforms other conventional financing strategies when the profitability of service provision is low or the premium revenue of the FL firm due to its better utilization of the equipment is relatively high . Moreover the preference of the downstream firm on alternative financing models might not be exactly consistent with that of the upstream firm or the supply chain system . Under some conditions the downstream firm prefers TCF to other strategies while the upstream firm and the supply chain system is better off under FL . Furthermore we extend our research to some general situations e.g . endogenous interest rate in BCF positive quantity of equipment endowed with the downstream firm and integrated union of the upstream firm and the FL firm . Most of the results derived in the basic model can be further applied in most of the general situations .
624,The COVID 19 pandemic in 2019 2020 ushered in a new turbulent and chaotic global environment where governments not only placed temporary restrictions on peoples movements but also mandated limits on business activities . However lacking in the contemporary scholarly discourse is a deeper understanding of how businesses respond to such pandemics . In this
625,Liner carriers must regularly adjust their shipping networks to respond to competitors and changing seasonal customer demands . They do this by selecting and moving ships between routes . State of the art approaches decompose this into two separate problems . We propose an integrated mathematical model and matheuristic for the liner shipping fleet deployment and repositioning problem that jointly optimizes the choice of vessels for routes and the cost of moving vessels to their assignments . We use real world data to show that simultaneously optimizing deployment and repositioning can result in significant cost reduction over solving the problems independently .
626,This paper proposes an adding runs strategy to alleviate in vehicle crowding for peak hour bus services . Passengers departure time choices under user equilibrium and system optimum conditions are investigated with and without adding runs strategy . A bi level programming model is developed to determine the optimal adding runs strategy . An artificial bee colony algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed bi level problem . Numerical examples show that the adding runs strategy is effective in alleviating crowding effects and reducing schedule delay in peak hour bus services . The total system cost can be reduced by more than 8 with the optimal adding runs strategy .
627,The transit equilibrium assignment problem aims to predict the distributions of passenger flows on lines or line segments in a transit network . Compared to the traffic assignment problem for highway networks the TEAP is much less studied especially in terms of solution algorithms . This paper proposes two Newton type hyperpath based algorithms for a frequency based TEAP formulation that considers both the congestion effect related to crowding and the queuing effect related to boarding . These newly developed algorithms as well as two benchmark algorithms from the literature are tested and compared on a number of transit networks including two constructed using real world data . The results show the proposed hyperpath based algorithms significantly outperform the benchmark algorithms in large networks .
628,The expectation of the largest gap between two consecutive picks in an aisle is a basic building block in modelling the pick travel distance for the largest gap routing policy in a warehouse . Researchers have predominantly used either simulation or recursive algorithms for its estimation . This paper develops analytical expressions for this statistic in both continuous and discrete aisles using the statistical theory of ordered uniform spacings . We further demonstrate how these results can apply to the entire multi aisle warehouse . Our results show that these expressions are accurate and extremely fast to evaluate as compared to the existing approaches .
629,This paper considers the problem of inferring statewide traffic patterns by scaling massive GPS trajectory data which capture about 3 of the overall traffic in Utah . It proposes a least absolute deviations model with controlled overfitting to scale 2.3 million trajectories such that resulting data best fit vehicle counts measured by 296 traffic sensors across the state . The proposed model improves on an often cited approach from the literature and achieves 45 lower error for locations not seen in model training obtaining 18 median hourly error across all test locations .
630,Crowd shipping is an innovative logistics service that occasional and professional couriers sign up for via an online platform to deliver packages upon requests by senders . Currently the demand and supply of CS is not yet well understood largely due to the limited real world data . This study aims to first fill this gap by analyzing the real world CS data from the city of Atlanta GA between April 2015 and August 2018 . We first present an overview of the real world CS data in three aspects the CS pricing scheme the CS spatial and temporal delivery patterns and comparison of preferences between the senders requests and the couriers bids . The analysis finds that the CS service has a clear price advantage over FedEx in the same day and express service as well as in the large extra large and huge size package delivery . The data analysis also reveals considerable discrepancies between senders and couriers preferences . We then compare two classes of the state of the art Deep Learning methods in their ability to predict short term CS delivery trip production . One class captures only the temporal features namely the Long Short term Memory Neural Network the Bidirectional Long Short term Memory Neural Network and the Gated Recurrent Unit . The other class considers both spatial and temporal features namely Convolutional Neural Network
631,As the number of countries liberalizing their skies increases some airlines notably carriers in the Middle East have extended their hub and spoke networks beyond domestic borders . This allows them to serve international destinations without the need to go through traditional gateway hubs so that they can compete with airline alliances relying on the traditional dual gateway or the so called dog bone networks . This paper proposes a stochastic optimization model to address the location choice issue of additional gateway airports with a consideration of the competition between airlines running traditional dog bone networks and hub and spoke networks in a liberalizing inter continental market . A two stage approach is adopted to model the effects of demand uncertainty . In the first stage the future passenger demand is not observable and thus airlines or airline alliances aim to maximize their own expected profit by choosing additional gateway airports from the set of candidate gateway airports pre specified by the regulator . In the second stage with the passenger demand observed and the gateway scheme fixed airlines determine their aircraft sizes and service frequencies to maximize their own profit and air passengers choose routes that minimize their own travel disutility . Based on a calibration of the demand dispersion parameters in elastic demand function the proposed model is applied to the China Europe aviation market which includes the inter continental international market and the associated Chinese and European domestic markets so that to ascertain the comparative advantages of different network configurations .

632,Optimization of the green logistics location routing problem with eco packages involves solving a two echelon location routing problem and the pickup and delivery problem with time windows . The first echelon consists of large eco package transport which is modeled by a time discretized transport concentrated network flow programming in the resource sharing statespacetime network . The second echelon focuses on small eco package pickups and deliveries established by the cost minimized synchronization oriented location routing model that minimizes the total generalized cost which includes internal transportation cost value of eco packages short term benefits and environmental externalities . In addition the Gaussian mixture clustering algorithm is utilized to assign customers to their respective service providers in the pickup and delivery process and a ClarkeWright saving method based non dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is designed to optimize pickup and delivery routes and improve their cost effectiveness and degree of synchronization . Different strategy testing results are used in the service phase as input data to calculate the cost of the transport phase which is solved through a Lagrangian relaxation approach . The 3D SST network representation innovatively captures the eco package route sequence and state transition constraints over the shortest path in the pickup and delivery at any given moment of the transport phase . A large scale logistics network in Chengdu China is used to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm and undertake sensitivity analysis considering the life cycle of green eco packages .
633,The tradable credit scheme as a revenue neutral management measure has received much attention in the field of traffic management in recent years . This paper investigates the management performance of the TCS on high occupancy vehicle lanes with the approach of equilibrium analysis . The analysis is based on a commuting scenario in which commuters use a multi lane highway with HOV lanes . We developed a basic system in which commuters have two alternative travel modes driving alone in general purpose lanes or carpooling in HOV lanes . Under this assumption the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a mathematical programming problem . We analyze the effects with respect to feasible TCSs effective TCSs and optimal TCSs respectively . We extend the basic system by considering regular carpoolers with the scenario of HOVs choosing GP lanes . Under this situation the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a variational inequality problem . We further analyze the management effects of different TCSs . Numerical examples demonstrate system indicators with several typical states the impact of key parameters on TCS management performance and the feature of the extended system in typical scenarios . Results show that the optimal TCS is achievable in the basic system by limiting the traffic flow of GP lanes . However the optimal TCS may not exist in the extended system considering regular carpoolers and a sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee its existence .

635,This study addresses an interesting tugboat scheduling problem considering uncertainty in both container ship arrival and tugging process times for large container ports . The uncertain ship arrival and tugging process times are formulated as a finite set of discrete scenarios that can be generated from historical port traffic data . We deal with the uncertainty by integrating proactive and reactive scheduling strategies such that this study is distinct from most existing studies in the literature . The proactive scheduling strategy considers the expected degree of variability and uncertainty during the execution of a tugboat fleet schedule while the reactive scheduling strategy properly adjusts the initial schedule to cope with unexpected scenarios with minimum recovery cost . A mixed integer linear programming model for the proposed tugboat scheduling problem is established . For a large scale problem an ad hoc algorithm is designed to generate tugging chains such that the large scale problem can be tackled effectively . The extensive numerical experiments are finally carried out to demonstrate the practical significances of the models and algorithms developed by this study .
636,We investigate a variant of the standard Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem where each vehicle is powered exclusively by electricity stored in its rechargeable battery . Consequently each vehicle should visit not only customer nodes but also some charging stations before the battery got depleted . The importance of this problem stems from the fact that logistics companies are increasingly relying on electric vehicles in urban distribution . We propose three exact approaches . The first one requires solving a compact polynomial sized formulation . The second approach is a branch and cut algorithm . An original feature of this algorithm is that it embeds the first exact separation of the well known rounded capacity constraints . Finally the third approach is a hybrid algorithm that requires solving an augmented variant of the compact formulation . We report the results of a computational study that was carried out on a set of 125 instances providing evidence that the polynomial sized formulation can consistently solve instances having up to 30 customer nodes and 21 charging stations and that the hybrid algorithm solves some instances having up to 100 customer nodes and 21 charging stations while requiring moderate CPU times . Furthermore the proposed approach was shown to exhibit limitations in solving some large scale tightly constrained instances .

By comparing Strategy BODS with a benchmark scenario where the manufacturer runs the online channel and the retailer manages the offline channel respectively and independently we generally find that if the competition between two channels is stronger the dual channel supply chain is more likely to implement Strategy BODS and vice versa . More importantly we pinpoint that a centralized supply chain has less motivation to implement Strategy BODS than a decentralized one .
638,The phenomena of the COVID 19 outbreak and the Arctic Iceberg melting over the past two years make us reconsider the impact our way of life has on the environment and the responsibility of business toward minimizing and potentially eliminating emissions . Increasing ship traffic in ports leads to the growing emission of air pollutants which influences the air quality and public health in the surrounding areas . The International Maritime Organization has adopted relevant regulations and mandatory energy efficiency measures to address ship emissions . To ensure the effective implementation of such regulations and measures air emission detection and monitoring has become crucial . In this paper a dynamic multitarget path planning model is developed to realize multi UAVs performing synergistic detection of ship emissions in ports . A path planning algorithm under a dynamic environment is developed to establish the model . This algorithm incorporates a Tabu table into particle swarm optimization to improve its optimization ability and it obtains the initial detection route of each UAV based on a minimum ring method . This paper describes a multi UAVs synergistic algorithm to formulate the path reprogramming time in a dynamic environment by judging and cutting the minimum ring . This finding proves the improved efficiency of air pollution detection by UAVs . It provides useful insights for maritime and port authorities to detect ship emissions in practice and to ensure ship emission reduction for better air quality in the postpandemic era .

640,The crew pairing problem is one of the most important but challenging tasks for commercial airlines . However the operation environment of the aviation industry is highly volatile with diverse uncertainties . Flight flying time variability is an important disruption that usually causes deviations of flight departure arrival times from the schedule . Traditional crew pairing frameworks without considering flight flying time variability can generate pairings that are fragile to flight delays . However the impact of flight flying time variability on crew pairings is under explored . In this paper we propose two robustness enhancement strategies based on the consideration of flight flying time variability . Besides two robustness measurements are developed to construct two novel robust crew pairing models . One is time based while the other is number based . A customized column generation based solution algorithm is proposed . Computational experiments based on real flight schedules show that our new models can greatly enhance solution robustness at a price of an acceptable increase in operating costs compared with the traditional model . Besides extreme delay flights can be completely avoided in the proposed models . Moreover the solutions obtained from the time based model show higher resistance against the disruption of flight flying time variability with a lower operating cost than the number based model .
641,In this paper we study a Multi Attribute Inventory Routing Problem . A mathematical formulation and exact solution algorithms are introduced for this problem . More precisely we extend the Multi Depot Inventory Routing Problem in order to consider the multi product case with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and explicit constraints for the route duration . The MAIRP is an NP hard problem more complex than the classical Inventory Routing Problem . Moreover it captures many features that can be found in real applications of a vendor managed inventory strategy . We introduce a hybrid exact algorithm to solve it in which several Mixed Integer Programming models are solved to explore the neighborhoods of a Variable Neighborhood Search scheme applied to the MAIRP . We design several neighborhoods that are based on the features of the problem . The impact of this hybridization is a faster convergence of the model and an accelerated resolution process with respect to a branch and cut algorithm applied to the regular MIP formulation . Extensive computational results on new and existing instances from the literature on two benchmark problems and a real data set confirm the high efficiency of our algorithm .

643,This paper studies the container slot allocation problem for time sensitive cargoes with consideration of dynamic pricing and port congestion under uncertain demand . Time sensitive cargoes call for express delivery . However port congestion is a non negligible factor to affect the delivery time . Hence a new freight rate function with respect to the delivery time considering port congestion is proposed for time sensitive cargoes and two different slot allocation strategies are proposed Loyal Strategy and Expansive Strategy . Accordingly we formulate the problem as a one stage container slot allocation model and a two stage container slot allocation model respectively . Both of the two models are stochastic mixed integer quadratic programming models with chance constraints due to the involvement of dynamic pricing port congestion and uncertain demand . To solve the proposed models a tailored algorithm that combines the Sample Average Approximation approach and the Reformulation Linearization Technique is developed in this paper . Finally numerical experiments are carried out to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed models and the solution algorithm .

We examine the product propositions in a competitive supply chain adopting decoy effect from the perspectives of a high end firm or a low end firm respectively . We also investigate impacts of consumers behavioral factors on the decoy effect such as rationality social influence and loss aversion preference . Further we test whether decoys can be as effective online as they are offline and effective in a monopolistic supply chain as well . A multi agent system is built to conduct simulations .
646,When a luxury brand manufacturer sells its product in two separate markets with price discrimination it may face gray marketers who purchase the product in the lower price market and resell it in the higher price market . To mitigate the effects of the gray market a luxury brand manufacturer may strategically select its sales channels to sell the product in both markets simultaneously in both markets sequentially or exclusively in the high price market . We derive the equilibria for each strategy and demonstrate that selling strategy can mitigate the negative the impact of gray market . The results further show that gray market is active only if the customers valuation discount for gray products is moderate and the gap between the customers perceived status valuation of the two markets is relatively large . As compared to the case without the gray market we find an interesting and counter intuitive result that gray market activity can mitigate the double marginalization effect and lead to a Pareto improvement for both the manufacturer and its retailer . Our research enriches the literature on gray markets by offering new insights and implications and our results provide international luxury brand manufacturers with guidelines for efficiently managing cross market sales channels .

650,Immune checkpoint blockade strategy based on suppressing programmed death 1 programmed death ligand 1 pathway has been proved to be promising and effective in cancer immunotherapy . However its potential risk of immune related adverse events places stringent requirements on the precise loading of anti PD L1 agent in nanomedicine . Precise control of the loading content of anti PD L1 antibody is a difficult task since physical encapsulation has inevitable drawbacks like batch to bath variation and chemical modification is limited by the low stability of the antibody . Herein we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to develop the nanomedicine with precise control of anti PD L1 agent content by using anti PD L1 peptide as the substitute to anti PD L1 antibody . The APP was chemically bonded with a photosensitizer IR780 to obtain IR780 M APP a molecule able to self assemble into nanoparticles with a precise APP loading determined by the molecular structure . Specifically the IR780 moiety in IR780 M APP NPs endows the nanoparticles with photodynamic therapeutic effect as well as the ability to trigger immunogenic cell death while the APP moiety can block the PD 1 PD L1 pathway for promoting immunotherapy . The proposed photodynamic immunotherapy nanoplatform not only killed primary tumors directly but also eradicated the metastatic and invasive tumors effectively . The present molecular engineering strategy combined with anti PD L1 peptide might provide more opportunities for the design of advanced nanoplatforms for cancer therapy .

656,Transformations of the molecular compositions of dissolved organic matter in incineration leachate were investigated . Results revealed that DOM in IL had a lower oxidation degree than that in mature MSW landfill leachate . Moreover aliphatic compounds having the highest bioavailability were the most abundant type of DOM in IL making IL significantly more biodegradable than LL . Under microbial actions etc . DOM composed of phenolic compounds 0.50 and H C 1.5 polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in MBR treated effluents were enriched and more diverse than in the untreated leachates . Nanofiltration dramatically lowered the relative abundances of phenolic compounds polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in effluent generated by treatment of IL in a MBR . Although the concentration of DOM in NF effluent was comparatively low the DOM compositions in the resulting NF concentrate were nearly identical to those in MBR effluent but were more complex than those in an international standard DOM due to a higher content of CHOS and CHONS heteroatomic compounds . Particularly coagulation in conjunction with ozone hydrogen peroxide oxidation process were dramatically reduced most polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics from the NF concentrate .

662,Oxytetracycline fermentation residue can be managed by bioprocesses to recycle organic substances . However the organic materials present are resistant to biodegradation due to protection by the OFR matrix structure and the high levels of residual oxytetracycline have unavoidably negative impacts on microorganisms in bioprocesses and result in the poor biodegradability of OFR . Hydrothermal treatment is promising for processing OFR to improve its biodegradability but there is still insufficient practical experience with HT of OFR . To explore the applicability of employing HT as a pretreatment to improve the biodegradability of OFR HT processes at temperatures varying from 90C to 180C were performed on OFR to disintegrate its matrix and inactivate the high levels of residual oxytetracycline . The results demonstrated that performing HT clearly enhanced the production of hydrophilic matter including soluble chemical oxygen demand soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins . Nevertheless the drawbacks of HT for degrading soluble organics and mineralizing total organics were clearly observed at 180C . Efficient destruction of the OFR matrix structure was speculated based on the release of carbohydrates and proteins and was visually confirmed by photomicrographs and scanning electron microscopy graphs .

Acid zeolites like ZSM 5 convert methanol to dimethyl ether and water followed by the formation of olefins as well as of paraffins and aromatics as side products . In this study butene was used as model compound for the recycle in the industrial methanol to propylene process and co fed with methanol . During these kinetic experiments both methanol and butene inlet partial pressures were varied as well as the total volumetric flow rates . Temperatures between 708 and 788K were applied as the aim of this work is to model the fundamental kinetics of the MTO chemistry at olefin co feed conditions . For the kinetic model the single event methodology is used in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters while depicting each surface reaction . Olefin interconversion as well as olefin methylation and oxygenate interconversion steps are all covered by the model . Only the formation of aromatics is described in a simplified and thus not fundamental way . Over 4000 reaction steps are modeled using only eleven estimated parameters . The resulting high numeric significance of the activation energies allows a mechanistic analysis of the different reaction pathways and an assessment of the most important propene production steps . This shows high temperatures to be advantageous for fast carbon transfer to the olefin hydrocarbon pool and subsequent cracking of mainly hexenes and heptenes to propene .

675,Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass especially that of high moisture such as microalgae macroalgae sludge manure and food waste for the production of bio oil has been widely concerned worldwide . However the contents of nitrogen in these biomasses are commonly high and 2040 of the N in the raw biomasses would distribute into bio oil during the HTL process resulting in a high content of N in bio oil sometimes up to 10wt .

825,A series of xerogels with a properly designed porous structure and surface chemistry have been synthesized and evaluated as a host structure to promote the nucleation and growth of methane hydrates . Organic xerogels have been synthesized from resorcinol formaldehyde mixtures using a sol gel approach and microwave heating . These xerogels are hydrophilic in nature and possess designed meso macrocavities in the pore size range 555nm . Carbon xerogels have been synthesized from their organic counterparts after a carbonization treatment at high temperature . Interestingly the carbonization process does not alter modify substantially the porous network of the parent xerogels while developing new micropores . Under water supplying conditions the two types of xerogels exhibit a large improvement in the methane adsorption capacity compared to the pure physisorption process taking place in dry conditions and associated with a significant hysteresis loop . These excellent values must be associated with the promoting effect of these xerogels in the water to hydrate conversion process . The comparison of OGs and CGs as a host structure anticipates that surface chemistry total pore volume and pore size are critical parameters defining the extent and yield of the methane hydrate formation process .
826,This study investigated the removal of Acetaminophen using biochars having different physicochemical characteristics .

827,In this work the degradation of hydroxychloroquine drug in aqueous solution by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes including electrochemical oxidation using boron doped diamond and its combination with UV irradiation and sonication was investigated . EO using BDD anode achieved the complete depletion of HCQ from aqueous solutions in regardless of HCQ concentration current density and initial pH value . The decay of HCQ was more rapid than total organic carbon indicating that the degradation of HCQ by EO using BDD anode involves successive steps leading to the formation of organic intermediates that end to mineralize . Furthermore the results demonstrated the release chloride Cl
828,The development of nanothermites with adjustable reactivity has always been the research hotspot in the field of energetic materials and its key issue is to control the interfacial contact extent and diffusion length between fuel and oxidizer . Here the 3DOM CuO Al 3DOM CuO Al NPs and CuO NPs Al NPs nanothermites which show a gradual decrease in contact extents between reactants were firstly prepared simultaneously using magnetron sputtering P4VP self assembly and ultrasonic mixing respectively . The DSC thermograms show that the heat release of the 3DOM CuO Al can reach 2541.4J g much larger than either value of the prepared 3DOM CuO Al NPs and CuO NPs Al NPs . The activation energies of these CuO Al systems also exhibit the similar results as the heat releases . However the 3DOM CuO Al NPs can lead to the highest combustion pressure the shortest pressure rise time and the fastest pressurization rate followed orderly in corresponding values by the CuO NPs Al NPs and 3DOM CuO Al . All data indicate that the contact extent between CuO and Al plays a great effect on the overall reactivity and their differences in structure and volume are responsible for the diverse combustion pressure performance . Furthermore the presence of reaction voids between components can promote the O diffusion to enhance the continuous mass and heat transfer for an efficacious reaction . Hence it is believed that similar methods can be used to improve the contact extent and diffusion length between fuels and oxidants so as to achieve an adjustment in reactivity for various nanothermites .
829,Highly stable emulsified water in oil mixtures from industrial processes have severe impact on the environment . As their abundance is increasing worldwide the methods to effectively separate these emulsified wateroil mixtures have attracted significant interest in recent years . Herein a durable superhydrophobic cotton based material using poly 1 3 phenylene bisoxazoline and raw cotton was developed . The as prepared SCM possesses superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity . The SCM has excellent repellence not only toward pure water but also hot water and corrosive aqueous liquids . The superwetting composite also exhibits durable superhydrophobicity after long term immersion in organic solvents . Moreover after the compression process the superwetting material exhibits a remarkable oilwater separation performance . Very high permeation flux values of up to 10 400400Lm
830,Si is a promising candidate for next generation anode materials in lithium rechargeable batteries as it has a high theoretical specific capacity . However mechanical damage due to volume changes during electrochemical cycling and low electrical conductivity are critical limitations for practical anode applications . Herein a novel microscale 2D active material with alternating layers of Si and silicon oxide is developed and its energy storage properties are investigated by fabricating a composite anode with conventional graphite . The composite anode shows improved specific capacity by the introduction of veneer shaped Si microparticles and 88 capacity retention after 200 chargedischarge cycles . The adequate thickness of the layers and the repeating buffering layer existence in the high aspect ratio microscale particles that mimic a 2D nanostructure minimized the volume changes of the Si based electrode during cycling while achieving high electrical conductivity . This strategy can provide fundamental breakthroughs in overcoming the existing limitations of Si based materials for the development of high energy density active materials for Li batteries .
831,Although wastewater treatment plants can retain a high percentage of microplastics arriving at the facilities no method for extracting and characterizing these microparticles has been still standardized in these units . This study investigated three protocols of chemical digestion prior to analysis of microplastics one directed to the effluents using peroxidation and two for activated sludge . The samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant located in Valencia . In addition four common types of polymers were used to assess the influence of reagent exposure on microparticle integrity . Peroxidation was effective in treating the studied effluents and was also identified as the ideal protocol for activated sludge . The analysis showed that the use of H
832,For flexible capacitive energy storage units in wearable devices areal metrics such as areal capacitance and energy density are exceptionally important because of limitations on device volume and weight . One dimensional carbon nanofibers composited with active metal oxides such as cobalt monoxide possess extraordinary electrochemical properties . However low areal metrics and the polarity in the flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device are two crucial challenges . Herein vanadium cobalt oxides on carbon nanofibers are purposely designed and fabricated by electrospinning and controllable post calcination which can be used as a binder free non polarity membrane electrode for the assembly of high performance flexible supercapacitor . Importantly the rational incorporation of vanadium with varying valence states helps promote the formation of CoO phase enriches the reaction sites and enhances the capability of local electron transport . As expected the single electrode of VCO CNFs yields an extraordinarily high areal capacitance of 1.83Fcm
833,It is a very important task of searching for novel hole transporting materials along with effective building blocks on the way towards commercialization of the perovskite solar cells . 9 10 Dihydrophenanthrene is a rigid conjugated system whose skeleton is closely analogous to the widely used fluorene unit in developing HTMs . Herein for the first time DHP employed as a promising building block in the construction of HTMs for PSCs is presented . Two readily available DHP cored small molecules namely K DHP 1 and K DHP 2 were synthesized and characterized . An attractive bridged ketal pattern of the two molecules was revealed by the X ray crystallography of K DHP 2 . Afterwards the two compounds were applied as HTMs in conventional PSCs with a FA
834,A spray coating based on an adsorbent polyvinyl alcohol borax complex was developed to remove radioactive cesium from surfaces by adsorption for wide area surface decontamination . Two aqueous solutions of borax and PVA containing adsorbents namely Prussian blue bentonite and sulfur zeolite were simultaneously sprayed on surfaces which subsequently self generated a gel like coating via a borate diol ester bond between borax and PVA . The spray coating adhered adequately to vertical surfaces for at least 1h due to its good viscoelasticity and displayed
835,The exploitation of economical efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction is of far reaching significance for the scalable implementation of the water electrolysis technology and associated sustainable energy devices .

836,The aim of this study was to determine the association between levels of residential surrounding greenness preschool children s park use sedentary behaviour and mental and general health . This cross sectional study included 1489 4 6 year old children residents of Kaunas city Lithuania . Responses to the questionnaires completed by parents were used to ascertain children s general and mental health . We estimated exposure to greenness by the normalised difference vegetation index and time spent in a park . We used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent associations between health outcomes and surrounding greenness and time spent in the nearest city park controlling for potential confounders . Of all the studied children 14 had poor perceived general health and 44.7 spent 5 or more hours per week in city parks . A significant increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in children with poor health . Every additional hour of time spent in parks was associated with decreased sedentary behaviour and a lower risk of poor health meanwhile lower residential greenness was associated with poorer mental and general health . Compared with NDVI 100m median and park use exceeding 5h per week lower greenness exposure and shorter park usage were associated with the risk of poor health and the general risk of mental difficulties in 46 year old children . Lower residential greenness levels and less time spent in a park were associated with poorer general and mental health among 4 6 year old children . Physical activity in green spaces is recommended as a measure to prevent poor general and mental health among children .
837,Studies have suggested that phthalates may be a risk factor for microalbuminuria whereas little is known regarding their nephrotoxic effects on adults . We enrolled 311 participants who provided questionnaire information as well as blood and urine samples from a nationally cross sectional study . Urinary phthalate metabolites were analyzed through liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry . From the renal function index we measured the serum level of blood urea nitrogen and the urinary levels of microalbumin albumin protein and creatinine . We used multiple logistic regressions and a cumulative risk assessment of renal effect to evaluate the relationship between phthalate exposure and renal function in our participants .
838,Among live births Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 is the most commonly occurring autosomal trisomy typically resulting from meiotic nondisjunction . Currently advanced maternal age and altered recombination patterns are the only well known risk factors for nondisjunction . Maternal occupation has not been investigated as a risk factor for maternally derived cases of trisomy 21 . This study explored the association between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction stratified by the stage of maternal error either Meiosis I or Meiosis II . Additionally we investigated specific toxic agents associated with occupation classes . Using narrative job descriptions from the National Down Syndrome Project a population based case control study occupation was coded using the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification . Odds ratios were calculated for the association between occupation class and having a child with DS stratified by meiotic stage . An exposure analysis was performed within occupational classes that were statistically significant predictors of having a child with DS . Odds ratios were calculated to analyze associations between individual exposures and having a child with DS . The odds of MII nondisjunction were increased among Production Workers . Women who worked as Life Physical and Social Scientists or in Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations experienced greater likelihood of MI errors and OR 1.87 respectively . Exposure to solvents within the Production Worker group was a significant predictor for MI nondisjunction . No other environmental agents had a significant association with nondisjunction . Specific maternal occupation classes were associated with MI and MII chromosome 21 nondisjunction . These occupation classes were selected for an exposure analysis which determined solvents as highly predictive of MI nondisjunction among Production Workers . Findings from this analysis will serve to further explore the relationship between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction .
839,Residential green space may improve human health for example by promoting physical activity and by reducing stress . Conversely residential green space may increase stress by emitting aeroallergens and exacerbating allergic disease . Here we examine impacts of exposure to residential green space on distress in the susceptible subpopulation of adults sensitized to tree pollen allergens . In a panel study of 88 tree pollen allergy patients we analyzed self reported mental health perceived presence of allergenic trees near the residence and residential green space area within 1km distance and low green . Results were adjusted for patients background data and compared with distress in the general population . Short term distress was higher in the study population than in the general population . Residential green space had protective effects against short term distress low green per 10ha OR 0.85 . However distress was higher in patients who reported perceived presence of allergenic trees near their residence . Perceived presence of allergenic tree species in the neighbourhood of the residence of tree pollen allergy patients modulates the protective effect of residential green space against distress during the airborne tree pollen season .
840,New Jersey residents in some areas may be exposed to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances due to PFAS contamination of public drinking water . This contamination stems from industrial discharges and the use of aqueous film foaming foams at military bases and commercial airports for drills and locations where fires occurred . Exposure to PFAS has raised significant public health concerns due to its persistence both in the environment and human body . The potential toxicity of these chemicals may pose risks to human health . Statewide biomonitoring data is needed to establish a baseline of exposure and to identify the subpopulations at risk . The NJ Department of Health conducted a statewide NJ Biomonitoring study for PFAS utilizing a cost effective sampling approach i.e . acquiring remnant sera from both clinical laboratories and blood banks across NJ . This convenience sampling approach was adopted as an alternative to a costly and labor intensive probability based population sampling . One thousand and thirty human sera were collected from NJ adults between 20 and 74 years of age from 2016 to 2018 with additional information of county sex and age . The serum collection was demographically and geographically dispersed across four seasons . Twelve PFAS analytes were measured for the specimens collected . The data were post stratified by county sex and age groups . Stratified individual sample weights were developed and used to estimate population means compare least squared mean differences and examine contributing variables . Geometric means and percentiles with 95 confidence intervals of the target analytes are presented providing preliminary baselines of the statewide PFAS exposure for NJ adults . PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS were selected for in depth analyses because their GMs were greater than 0.5ng mL and they were detected over 99 in study population . Subjects from this study had higher serum levels of PFOA PFNA and PFHxS compared to the general U.S. population reported by the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . However the distributions of PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS across sex and age groups were consistent with the patterns found in NHANES i.e . all differed by sex and age group . Further sex and age stratification showed significantly lower concentrations of the 4 analytes in younger females than in older females and males . Future research is needed to identify PFAS exposure sources and to develop effective intervention strategies . Continuing PFAS biomonitoring using population sampling is recommended for tracking trends and better identifying subpopulations at risk .
841,To investigate if ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease is associated with long term occupational exposure to ultrafine particles outdoors at an airport . This is a register based follow up study based on a cohort comprising an exposed group of 6515 men employed in unskilled work at Copenhagen Airport and a reference group of 61 617 men in unskilled work in other firms in greater Copenhagen during 19902012 . The exposure was assessed from information on proportion of time spent on the airport apron for each calendar year and the primary exposure measure was cumulated apron years . The cohort was merged to the National Patient Register that includes data on all contacts to public and private hospitals in Denmark and the Register of Causes of Death . Risk estimates were provided by Poisson regression and adjusted for age calendar year and educational level . We found no associations between cumulative apron years and IHD or cerebrovascular disease when adjusted for confounders . In this large cohort study we found no association between outdoor occupational exposure to UFP and IHD and cerebrovascular disease .
842,This study assessed the presence of 27 pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to common therapeutic groups in the tissues of representative seafood species of bivalves cephalopods arthropods and fish of high economic importance and consumption rates in North Western Spain . Four pharmaceutical compounds out of the 27 analyzed were detected in the collected samples . The benzodiazepine citalopram was detected in the tissues of common octopus 14.1ngg
843,Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in buildings constructed with PCB containing materials can lead to increased body burden of PCB for building users . Exposure to PCB from building related sources was assessed by measuring PCB in serum and hand wipes in two groups of tenants living in the same building estate in apartments constructed with and without PCB . The median serum levels of the sum of 19 PCB congeners was 777ng g lw for the exposed group and 282ng g lw for the reference group . The congener pattern in serum of the exposed was shifted towards lower chlorinated congeners and was dominated by tri and tetrachlorinated congeners . The largest difference in serum levels between the groups was observed for PCB 28 with median levels of the exposed being 70 times higher than in the reference group . For very persistent lower chlorinated congeners like PCB 28 66 and 74 an increase with residence times was observed as a result of accumulation over time . Less persistent congeners such as PCB 44 and 70 were also elevated in the exposed group but independent of residence time . The less persistent congeners can therefore be used as markers of recent exposure to original PCB sources . The hand wipes also showed a large exposure contrast e.g . PCB 28 being more than 60 times higher in the exposed group compared to the reference group and no overlap between the groups . All measured di to pentaPCB congeners were significantly higher in hand wipes from the exposed group compared with the reference group . Thus hand wipes seem to be a good non invasive screening tool for ongoing indoor exposure to PCB . Furthermore the measured level of PCB on hand wipes was significantly correlated to PCB in blood for almost all congeners . In conclusion PCB exposure in contaminated buildings can contribute significantly to the exposure and total body burden of PCB and the lower chlorinated congeners can make up the majority of the total PCB body burden .
844,Exposure to occupational noise might increase the risk of hypertension . However limited cohort studies have investigated the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and the development of hypertension . We conducted a 17 year cohort study involving 2459 workers to assess the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension in the aerospace industry . We performed an extended Cox proportional hazard model considering occupational noise exposure as time varying covariates . Furthermore we employed the distributed lag nonlinear models to examine the exposure response relationship . In the extended Cox proportional model as workers were exposed to noise over 80 dBA the hazard ratios of hypertension significantly increased with a noise increase of 5 dBA . In exposure response associations the HRs of hypertension steadily increased between noise levels of 82 and 106 dBA . After additionally adjusting for personal protection equipment the HRs decreased dramatically between 107 and 124 dBA . Our study refined the exposure assessment by integrating time varying exposures to occupational noise and taking work history into consideration . Our findings suggested that workers exposed to noise levels between 82 and 106 dBA for 317 years may increase the risk of hypertension with a non linear exposure response pattern . We further provided evidence that workers wearing PPE could effectively reduce noise exposure and avoid the development of hypertension .
845,The Korean government implemented partial smoke free regulations in hospitality venues 150m Data from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey II a nationally representative cross sectional study were used . In total 4218 non smoking adults were selected based on questionnaires and urinary cotinine concentrations . Linear trend tests of urinary cotinine over time and socio demographic factors associated with urinary cotinine in 2014 were examined based on weighted linear regression models . Overall the covariate adjusted least square geometric mean concentrations of urinary cotinine were 2.95g g creatinine in 2012 1.54g g Cr in 2013 and 1.47g g Cr in 2014 a significant decrease during 20122014 . Urinary cotinine concentrations decreased significantly during 20122014 in most socio demographic subgroups . However concentrations in adults who worked in hospitality venues including restaurants bars cafes fast food franchises and bakeries remained unchanged . Data from 2014 when smoke free regulations were implemented in hospitality venues 100m Overall urinary cotinine concentrations of Korean non smoking adults decreased during 20122014 . However implementation of partial smoke free regulations in hospitality venues was not effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure in workers at hospitality venues .
846,The application of Water Safety Plans in China varies throughout the country . Although pilot WSP projects in China were initiated shortly after WSP was introduced by the World Health Organization in 2004 they have yet to be used for water supply facilities at a large scale . To better understand the evolution of WSP application in China a systematic review was conducted to identify all published WSP related studies in China . Eighteen studies which included 311 water systems were included in the final analysis . Risk matrix water supply risk factors and other data were extracted and analyzed . Text mining methods were also used to better understand risks that can be addressed by WSPs . This study revealed a number of noteworthy differences between and among urban and rural water systems in China . The primary risks associated with most urban water supply systems tended to be related to mechanical failure s in the water treatment process . Rural water supply systems appear to suffer from similar problems but insufficient overall management capacity was more prevalent in rural systems . Overall the evidence suggests that to date the use of WSPs in China has been primarily limited to pilot studies and full implementation of WSPs in China appears to still be in the early stages . The paper closes with a summary of the key obstacles identified as well as a discussion of policies and technical options which could increase the use of WSPs in both urban and rural China . Among other recommendations the data indicate that there is strong need for the development and implementation of a simplified WSP approach designed specifically for small rural systems in China .
847,Recently in South Africa wastewater treatment plants have come under scrutiny because of increased reports of their ineffectiveness to treat wastewater adequately . This study focused on assessing potential health risks for humans exposed to concentrations of heavy metals in river systems that receive effluents from wastewater treatment plants in the Maluti a Phofung municipality . Untreated influents and treated effluents from two plants one in the town of Phuthaditjhaba the other in the town of Harrismith were analysed for heavy metals . Water samples were also collected from the Elands and the Wilge Rivers which receive effluents from the treatment plants in Phuthaditjhaba and Harrismith respectively . All samples were analysed for heavy metals Iron Magnesium Manganese Zinc Copper Chromium Nickel Lead Cobalt Arsenic Cadmium using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry . The probabilistic human health risk was estimated using the Total Hazard quotient and Monte Carlo techniques . The results showed that there was no significant difference between treated and untreated wastewater in the concentration of heavy metals for both wastewater treatment plants using the student T test . This indicated the inability of both treatment plants to remove metal contaminants adequately . Projections of non cancer risk for metals in river water samples indicated a high potential for non cancer risk for humans upon exposure via ingestion with Arsenic being a significant contributor to overall risk . The results of this study underscore the need for improved wastewater treatment facilities in this region in order to ensure ecosystem integrity and public health safety .
848,The German Environmental Survey for Children and Adolescents 20142017 investigated the current internal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides . These analyses were carried out for a population representative sub sample of 1135 children and adolescents of all 2394 GerES V participants .
849,Evidence of negative health effects of solid waste management is uncertain . Available reviews suggests the use of biomarkers in human biomonitoring to detect low exposure levels . In September 2013 a waste to energy plant located in the Turin went into operation . The SPoTT monitoring program was set up to assess the potential health impact caused by the plant . The paper illustrates the results of HBM of metals in the workers before the plant went into operation and then at 1 year and 3 years . This study is one of the few focusing on workers with a longitudinal design .
850,As part of an investigation of the total indoor exposure of residents in PCB contaminated apartments in a building estate in Denmark 73 homes were visited . Samples of air vacuum cleaner dust and surface wipes were taken and analysed for 15 PCB congeners . The 53 apartments located in high rise buildings with indoor PCB containing sealants showed significant elevated total concentrations of PCB in air dust and surface wipes compared to 20 reference homes . The average concentration in exposed homes was 2330ng PCB
851,The water safety plan approach integrates risk assessment and management practices into a drinking water supply system ensuring water quality from the catchment to the consumer . This research was oriented toward the development and implementation of a WSP in the DWSS for the city of Santiago de Cali Colombia . We adapted the methodological stages of the WSP established by the World Health Organization assemble a WSP team describe the existing DWSS identify hazards and hazardous events evaluate risks and plan risk management . In this methodological structure we propose the use of different risk assessment tools at each step of DWSS which can be implemented in water systems of different sizes . The results of our study allowed the identification of hazardous events that may compromise the effectiveness of the WSP Of the 103 events found 16 were related to the catchment 40 to treatment processes 27 to the distribution system and 9 to consumers while the remaining 11 were associated with organizational planning contingency and emergency factors . We found that the most critical components of the DWSS are the distribution system and the consumers with 29.6 and 33.3 of the hazardous events classified as at a very high risk level respectively . Clearly improvement and support programs for the WSP were needed to optimize existing control measures and corrective actions and to evaluate new ones to reduce risk levels . The treatment processes and distribution system steps were shown as the main barriers of the DWSS mainly they are under governance of water company unlike the catchment and consumers which presented higher levels of risk because in these steps the water company has less control and influence . Our research confirms that the WSP is an important tool for decision making by water service companiesimproving their administrative financial organizational and operational management . It also shows that it is essential that their senior management and other stakeholders be part of the WSP team at each stage of implementation of the DWSS .
852,To evaluate the association between potential exposure to different pollen concentrations at the 11th fetal week and subsequent clinical atopic diseases . Parents of 1 to 4 year old children returned a questionnaire regarding physician diagnosed atopic diseases . The children were born between 2001 and 2005 in the province of South Karelia Finland . Results of allergy tests were collected from patient records in the area . The prevalence of atopic diseases with sensitisation was higher in children whose 11th fetal week occurred during pollen rather than non pollen season atopic eczema 6.3 vs. 4.3 food allergy 5.7 vs. 3.9 respiratory allergy or asthma 3.7 vs. 2.2 and any atopic diseases 7.4 vs. 5.5 respectively . Respectively the prevalence was higher in the children exposed to high rather than low tree pollen concentrations 1000 vs. 10 particles m Coincidence of potential exposure to high tree pollen concentrations at the 11th fetal week is associated with subsequent clinical atopic diseases with sensitisation .
853,Manganese is an essential element diet being its main source . Some epidemiological studies have found that a prenatal excess of Mn could negatively affect neuropsychological development during infancy but the evidence is inconclusive . The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal serum Mn concentrations and child neuropsychological development assessed at 1 year of age . study subjects were 1179 motherchild pairs from two Spanish cohorts of the INMA Project . Mn was measured in serum samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy . Child neuropsychological development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development composed of both mental and psychomotor scales . Sociodemographic lifestyle and dietary information was collected through questionnaires during pregnancy and during the child s first year of life . Serum Mn was log 2 transformed . Multivariable linear regression models were built . Generalized additive models were used to assess the shape of the relation between prenatal exposure to Mn and the neuropsychological test scores . geometric mean and 95 confidence interval of maternal serum Mn was 1.50 g L. Levels of Mn were higher among non working mothers and in those with a higher consumption of nuts . The association between maternal Mn levels and child neuropsychological development was negative in the multivariable models for the mental 0.39 and psychomotor scales 0.92 although the coefficients were not statistically significant . The best shape describing the relationship between Mn and the Bayley scales was linear in both cases . This study shows a null association between maternal prenatal levels of Mn and neuropsychological development at one year after birth in two cohorts within the INMA study .
854,During the population representative German Environmental Survey of Children and Adolescents 2256 first morning void urine samples from 3 to 17 years old children and adolescents were analysed for 21 metabolites of 11 different phthalates di ethyl phthalate butylbenzyl phthalate di iso butyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate di cyclohexyl phthalate di n pentyl phthalate di phthalate di iso nonyl phthalate di iso decyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate .
855,bacteria can colonise and proliferate in water systems in the built environment and can be spread by aerosol generation . If inhaled by a susceptible individual this can lead to respiratory infections such as Legionnaires Disease or the generally milder Pontiac fever . Evaporative cooling systems including cooling towers used in industrial processes to dissipate excessive heat are prone to contamination by
856,Glycol ethers are an oxygenated solvent family widely present in consumer products . Some of them are recognized reproductive developmental or hematological toxicants . Although several glycol ether biomonitoring studies have been performed on adults from working or general populations no studies have hitherto been carried out on children . The aim of our study was to explore the detection of glycol ether metabolites in the urinary samples of 6 year old children and if any were found to describe them .
857,In most cases urban Wastewater Treatment Plants only partially abate pollutants occurring in the influent . Treated effluents can thus contain a complex mixture of ecotoxic pollutants such as heavy metals detergents disinfectants plasticizers pharmaceuticals residues or pesticides . In this context Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment provide essential decision making tools to public authorities for establishing environmental policies and conducting territorial planning . The present work aims to develop a territorial scale ERA methodology using two complementary approaches based on a Risk Quotient calculation the first based on the risk linked to each individual pollutant the second considering all pollutants present and the cocktail effect . This research was performed at 33 urban WWTPs of in a highly urbanized part of France . Initial minimum median and maximum pollutant concentrations in treated effluents were obtained from a literature review of physico chemical analysis studies to reconstitute typical effluents . The classical approach identified the riskiest substances and showed the risks for each WWTP . The mixture ERA approach revealed new risks which were not highlighted in the classical ERA approach thus increasing the number of WWTPs identified as at risk . This study shows the importance of accounting for the cocktail effect which is not considered in current regulatory decisions . Finally this methodology allowed us to identify the riskiest situations that could worsen in the context of climate change .
858,Identifying the origin of fecal contamination can support more effective interventions to interrupt enteric pathogen transmission . Microbial source tracking assays may help to identify environmental routes of pathogen transmission although these assays have performed poorly in highly contaminated domestic settings highlighting the importance of both diagnostic validation and understanding the context specific ecological physical and sociodemographic factors driving the spread of fecal contamination . We assessed fecal contamination of compounds in low income neighborhoods of urban Maputo Mozambique using a set of MST assays that were validated with animal stool and latrine sludge from study compounds . We sampled five environmental compartments involved in fecal microbe transmission and exposure compound water source household stored water and food preparation surfaces and soil from the entrance to the compound latrine and the entrances to each household . Each sample was analyzed by culture for the general fecal indicator
859,Smoking is an independent cause of cervical cancer which is the 4th most common malignancy in women . It is currently not known if tobacco consumption causes chromosomal damage in cervical cells and if age and the hormonal status have an impact on tobacco induced genetic instability in the cervix . We conducted a study with pre and post menopausal women smokers and never smokers . Smokers consumed 30 light medium cigarettes day and were matched with the non smoking group . Cervical cells were analyzed for induction of micronuclei which are caused by structural numerical chromosomal aberrations additionally other nuclear anomalies reflecting genomic instability and cytotoxicity were scored . Furthermore the frequencies of basal cells were recorded which reflect the mitotic activity of the mucosa . MN and other abnormalities were increased in both groups of smokers . The effects were most pronounced in postmenopausal smokers compared to premenopausal smokers . Also the number of basal cells was clearly enhanced in older women . Tar and nicotine had no detectable impact on chromosomal damage but a clear association with pack years was observed . Smoking increased chromosomal instability cytotoxicity and induced cell divisions in cervical mucosa cells of pre and post menopausal women . The effects were more pronounced in the latter group indicating a higher risk for diseases that are causally related to DNA damage .
860,The recycling of end of life vessels is a complex activity that generates an enormous amount of hazardous waste including asbestos containing materials . Efforts by the Government of India to comply with national and international regulations and improved standard operating procedures are expected to lower the exposure risk of the workforce to hazardous substances including asbestos . The current workers are likely to face lesser risks than did those exposed in the past . The present study assesses the health risks from past exposure of asbestos for those workers engaged in handling and removing ACM in ship recycling yards before environmentally sound recycling of obsolete ships was introduced in the early 2000s . Estimates were made of the number of workers exposed and the intensity of exposure and these data were used to estimate the likely number of mesothelioma deaths in the future . It was estimated that nearly 15 of the total workforce engaged in ship recycling will suffer from mesothelioma which translates to about 4 513 mesothelioma deaths among the total of 31 000 workers estimated to be ever employed in the yards from 1994 till 2002 . Recommendations are made for a practical approach to the safe handling of ACMs in Indian ship recycling yards .
861,Diarrhoeal disease is common and imposes substantial health and economic burdens across the globe especially in the African and Southeast Asian regions . Besides causing high mortality and morbidity diarrhoeal disease has also been associated with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children in low resource settings . Extreme weather events brought about by climate change may increase diarrhoeal disease and impact vulnerable populations in countries regardless of levels of development . We examined the seasonal and climatic influences of acute diarrhoeal disease reports in Singapore a city state located in Southeast Asia . We used a time series analysis adjusting for time varying potential confounders in a negative binomial regression model and fitting fractional polynomials to investigate the relationship between climatic factors and reported diarrhoeal disease . We included 1 798 198 reports of diarrhoeal disease from 2005 to 2018 . We observed annual trimodal peaks in the number of reports . Every 10 increase in relative humidity in the present week was positively associated with an increase in reports one week later 1.030 95 CI 1.0041.057 and negatively associated with a decrease in reports six weeks later . We observed effect modification of relative humidity on the risk of diarrhoeal disease in the first calendar quarter . There was weak evidence of a delayed effect of ambient air temperature on reports of diarrhoeal disease one week later . No threshold effects of climatic factors were observed . Each week of school holidays was associated with a 14.4 reduction in diarrhoeal disease reports . Public holidays were associated with a reduction in reports in the same week and an increase a week later . Diarrhoeal disease is highly seasonal and is associated with climate variability . Food safety and primary healthcare resource mitigation could be timed in anticipation of seasonal and climate driven increases in disease reports .
862,Enteropathogen contamination of water resources is a global concern . Several sources and routes of pathogen contamination of water resources have been identified including agriculture . Land spreading or disposal of manure livestock wastes is a notable source of public health relevant microorganisms into water . Microorganisms can be transported from manure amended soils into water from where they can reach animals and humans and may cause infection . This review explores the public health relevance of manure borne pathogens highlighting some of the diseases that manure associated pathogens cause . It also examines the dynamics of overland transport of pathogens into surface waters and percolation through soils into groundwater . Factors that influence the survival and transport of pathogens into respective water resources are discussed . The actual number of pathogens shed pathogen release rate requisite flow conditions precipitation characteristics and pathogen inactivation potential are some general factors examined in this review . Pathogen adaptation and survival in the soil environment is extensively discussed because soils significantly influence pathogen transfer into water . In addition to soil characteristics environmental variables such as moisture temperature and pH as well as soil biology are relevant aspects considered herein . Manure and farm management practices such as manure source and type storage and treatment also influence the occurrence survival and transport potential of pathogens . Optimized and recommended manure treatment techniques like composting which has been demonstrated to satisfactorily inactivate enteric pathogens in manure are discussed . The need for proper composting by observing recommended manuring stipulations is emphasized and finally practical strategies to protect water resources from pathogenic contamination are elucidated .
863,Despite the positive association between secondhand smoke and cardiovascular diseases no comprehensive assessment on the dose response relationship between SHS and CVD has yet been reported . Therefore a meta analysis was conducted to update the binary association and to elucidate the dose response relationship of both self reported and objectively measured SHS exposure with CVD . PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published up to November 12 2019 . Random effects models were used to assess the summary odds ratios of CVD with SHS exposure . Restricted cubic splines were used to fit the dose response relationship . Fifty five eligible observational studies were included in this meta analysis to investigate the association between SHS exposure and CVD . Based on the meta analysis the pooled OR of CVD was 1.22 for the self reported SHS individuals as comparing to the non exposed group . The result of restricted cubic splines showed a risk plateau of SHS exposure at 15 cigarettes per day Exposure to SHS is associated with an increased risk of CVD regardless of the modes . And thus well enforced smoke free laws could possibly reduce a substantial risk of CVD caused by SHS .
864,The 5th cycle of the German Environmental Survey investigated the internal human exposure of children and adolescents aged 317 years in Germany to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances . The fieldwork of the population representative GerES V was performed from 2014 to 2017 .
865,2 Mercaptobenzothiazole is widely used as a vulcanisation accelerator and is contained in many products made from natural rubber e.g . car tires . Additionally it is used as a fungicide in paint or fibre . Systemically human exposure to 2 MBT can occur via dermal and oral uptake or inhalation . Locally 2 MBT can cause skin sensitisation . The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified 2 MBT as probably carcinogenic to humans .
866,The phase out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers flame retardants has led to the rapid increase of alternatives such as phosphate flame retardants and plasticizers in many consumer products . Exposure to these additive chemicals is widespread and potentially harmful to humans and the environment . In the present study we assessed the exposure to PFRs through the analysis of metabolites in urine collected from 7 year old children from Hokkaido Japan between 2012 and 2017 . This allowed us to investigate temporal and seasonal trends for PFR metabolite concentrations and to study determinants of exposure . Thirteen metabolites of seven PFRs were measured in morning spot urine samples
867,Ensuring safe drinking water is the target of the Water Safety Plan approach which has been successfully applied to a large number of water supply systems around the world . Effective country wide scaling up of WSP implementation requires an enabling environment at the policy level .
868,Depression and anxiety have complex etiologies and are associated with a significant burden of disease . Although air pollution has been hypothesized as a possible risk factor of these disorders the associations are still under investigated . We aimed to analyze associations between long term exposure to ambient ozone and particulate matter with diameter 10m of 1.010 with 95 confidence interval for depression and an RR of 1.007 for anxiety . The effect estimates of PM Our findings indicate that increased levels of ambient ozone and PM
869,Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may impair genital development and alter reproductive tract anatomy . Anogenital distance is a useful biomarker of exposure to chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors . We evaluated associations between prenatal and perinatal exposure to several persistent organic pollutants and AGD in 4 year old children . Data were drawn from the INMA Asturias cohort . Pediatricians measured the anofourchetal distance in female children and anoscrotal distance in male children . The anogenital index was defined as the AGD divided by the child s weight at age of examination . We measured the levels of two hexachlorocyclohexane isomers hexachlorobenzene dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites six polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and six polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in maternal serum at 12 gestational weeks and in cord blood serum . Anthropometric and parental sociodemographic variables were collected via face to face interviews . Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between exposure to POPs and AGI adjusted for confounders and stratified by sex . In male children we found inverse associations between AGI and maternal concentrations of PCB 138 0.074 0.008 second tertile PCB 153 PCB 180 0.065 95 CI 0.096 0.035 second tertile 0.042 95 CI 0.073 0.011 third tertile PBDE 209 cord serum concentrations of PCB 153 and PCB 180 . In female children AGI was positively associated with maternal serum concentrations of PCB 101 and higher cord serum levels of 4 4 DDT and 4 4 DDE . Our findings provide evidence of associations between specific POPs and AGI in boys and girls aged 4 years and suggest that pre perinatal exposure to POPs has a feminizing effect in males and a masculinizing effect in females .
870,Soil is an important exposure pathway for lead and predictor of blood lead levels among children . Over the past two decades many areas within New York City have undergone a transition from industrial and manufacturing land use to residential housing . This can bring new residents to areas which contain the legacy of historic Pb contamination . The objective of this study was to evaluate the difference in soil Pb concentrations between community parks and greenspaces in areas undergoing rapid redevelopment and land use changes and stable areas without redevelopment . Three high and three low risk Pb contaminated areas within NYC were identified based on an additive index that included population growth industrial land use and new construction . Soil samples were collected across 34 parks and analyzed with an XRF with a subset also analyzed by ICP MS. Areas within NYC evaluated in this study with a high risk index had significantly larger mean concentrations of Pb in soil and double the rate of children under the age of six years with BLL 5ug dL compared to low risk areas . There was a statistically significant positive correlation between street density manufacturing industrial land density and population density change within 0.40 km of a park and soil Pb concentrations . However we were unable to estimate the source specific contribution of Pb concentrations in soil since many of the variables assessed were correlated with one another . Regardless of the source large population increases are occurring in areas with elevated soil Pb levels . In the three high risk areas investigated in this study the population has increased by over 35 000 residents between 2010 to 2017 compared to just 8 500 in the low risk areas .
871,Pyrethroid pesticide use is increasing worldwide although the full extent of associated health effects is unknown . An epigenome wide association study with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid related health effects . We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants blood in the Parkinson s Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California . We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years with site specific differential methylation and used a false discovery rate cut off of 0.05 for significance . We controlled for age sex education cell count and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity . We normalized methylation values for Type I II probe bias using Beta Mixture Quantile normalization filtered out cross reactive probes and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis . We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods and controlling for cell count . To facilitate broader interpretation we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p 0.05 and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip . We did this for both a biological process context using missMethyl and a disease set context using WebGestalt . For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets . After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures . When using GenomeStudio s Illumina normalization 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated including all four identified with the BMIQ method . In the gene set overrepresentation analyses we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization and 76 using Illumina normalization including the 6 identified by BMIQ . For disease sets we identified signals for Alzheimer s disease leukemia and several other cancers diabetes birth defects and other diseases for both normalization methods . We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count and controlling for cell count generally weakened p values . BMIQ normalization however resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p values . Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research . However this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations .

873,This study aimed to assess the effect of air pollution and weather conditions on the frequency of hospital admissions due to acute coronary syndrome in the population of Bialystok known as the capital of the Green Lungs of Poland . The study analyzed the medical records of 2 645 patients living within the borders of Bialystok who were treated for ACS between 2009 and 2017 and the data on air pollutantsnitrogen dioxide and unstable angina was 791 999 and 855 respectively . The daily concentration norm for PM The study showed that the effects of air pollution and weather conditions on the number of ACS hospitalizations are also observed in cities with moderately polluted or good air quality . NO
874,The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment in different countries around the world . Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification are urgently needed . Given the situation the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that in settings where facemasks are not available healthcare personnel might use homemade masks for the care of patients with COVID 19 as a last resort . Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail . Moreover there are a series of non medical materials available on the market such as household air filters coffee filters and different types of fabrics which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available . In this study we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size dependent filtration performances of non medical materials . The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size dependent filtration performances . The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials . The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance . Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators .
875,Access to safe sanitation and the elimination of open defecation are pre conditions for improved child health and nutrition and wider achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals . While Indonesia has a solid policy framework the country ranks third globally in terms of numbers of people practicing open defecation . Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of a five year strategy to reduce open defecation through accelerating implementation of the national sanitation program across districts receiving variable levels of external support . Among three provinces with poor sanitation program performance districts were selected to receive one of three levels of external support . High intensity districts benefitted from enabling environment strengthening support including political and social mobilization direct capacity development and efforts to strengthen planning budgeting monitoring and supervision learning districts benefitted from cross district learning opportunities and political mobilization through provincial government advocacy efforts and comparison districts were monitored under routine program conditions . Outcomes included open defecation free status and new toilet facility construction and were assessed through village level monitoring systems across all districts . Negative binomial regression and multivariate analysis were used to assess associations between levels of intervention intensity and outcomes . Among districts receiving high intensity external support improvements in political commitment planning coordination financing monitoring and supervision were observed . Relative to comparison districts high intensity districts were more likely to be ODF with greater increase in household toilet coverage . Weaker non significant associations with ODF were observed among learning districts relative to comparison districts . Efforts to strengthen provincial and district government capacity to implement sanitation programming in Indonesia can yield substantial improvements in outcomes in a relatively short period of time .
876,Surgical site infections after orthopaedic surgery are responsible for reduced quality of life increased length of hospital stay and costs . The most commonly identified organism is SSI rates were expressed as cumulative incidence rates per year .

877,This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between weather factors and COVID 19 infection in the State of Rio de Janeiro Brazil . Solar radiation showed a strong negative correlation with the incidence of novel coronavirus . Temperature and wind speed showed negative correlation . Therefore in this studied tropical state high solar radiation can be indicated as the main climatic factor that suppress the spread of COVID 19 . High temperatures and wind speed also are potential factors . Therefore the findings of this study show the ability to improve the organizational system of strategies to combat the pandemic in the State of Rio de Janeiro Brazil and other tropical countries around the word .
878,Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community associated infections . Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance . While biases of self report items for hand hygiene such as the tendency to overestimate one s behaviour represent a limitation direct survey questions remain important . This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes i.e . its frequency technique and duration . Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed . In a cross sectional computer assisted telephone interview design the resident population in Germany aged 1685 years was surveyed in 2012 . For handwashing duration frequency in different situations and technique were self reported . Self reports were rated as compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single and multi attribute indices . Use of hand disinfectants recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms and socio demographics were also assessed . In total N 4483 persons participated . Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross tabulation and multiple logistic regression . Primarily due to missing data the analysis was confined to N 4093 respondents . Among women the proportion of those who reported to wash hands almost always in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8 . In contrast 51 of men reported always using soap drying hands and washing interdigital spaces . Compliance based on indices that included frequency was higher in women by 5.2 for frequency technique and 2.5 for frequency duration and frequency duration technique . Socio demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers . Finally especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall namely for frequency technique all three attributes and technique . The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men . While being representative for Germany limitations include the survey s cross sectionality response rate and the study representing the situation in 2012 . Nonetheless indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation . Socio demographic differences add to existing evidence e.g . higher compliance by healthcare workers . Finally although reverse causation is possible it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique women recalling them reported higher frequency and men more often report hand disinfectant use suggesting possible carry over effects . Self reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these .
879,Dechloranes like Dechlorane Plus are commonly used flame retardants identified by the EU as substances of very high concern because of their persistence and bioaccumulation potential . To characterize the dechlorane exposure of Germans in the last two decades 180 archived blood plasma samples of the German Environmental Specimen Bank collected at six time points between 1995 and 2017 were analyzed for four dechloranes namely Dechlorane Plus
880,Emerging evidence suggests close domestic proximity of livestock and humans may lead to microbiological contamination of hands objects food and water supplies within domestic environments adversely impacting public health . However evidence quantifying the relationship between livestock domestic animals humans and microbiological contamination of household stored water remains limited . This longitudinal study aimed to examine the relationship between domestic contact with livestock and domestic animals on microbiological contamination of household Point of Use stored drinking water in rural Kenya and assess the influence of choice of faecal indicator on such associations . A survey was performed in 234 households in Siaya county Kenya to observe presence of livestock and domestic animals in household compounds alongside other risk factors for contamination of POU stored drinking water such as sanitation storage conditions and hygiene practices . Samples from water sources and from POU storage containers were tested for Rainwater was the main POU water source and was found to be highly susceptible to contamination . Multivariate analysis showed greater risk of gross water contamination and poultry within household compounds increases POU water contamination risk suggesting the need for improved interventions to address cross contamination within rural domestic settings . Within Siaya county more effective community education is needed to raise awareness of POU water quality protection particularly of rainwater .
881,The aim of this study was to gain more insight in the association between prevalence of diverse acute non specific symptoms and livestock density as a possible risk factor among residents of livestock dense and non dense regions taking into account socio demographic factors and psychological morbidity . Prevalence of NSS and psychological morbidity were assessed for the year 2017 based on electronic health records from 39 general practices in the Netherlands . The study group consisted of people who lived in rural areas with high numbers of livestock while the control group included people in rural areas with low numbers of livestock . For a large portion of the study group exposure estimates were calculated . Multiple logistic multilevel regression analyses were performed . Two methods were used 1 area comparisons between study and control areas in relation to health problems and 2 estimates of livestock exposure within the study area . It was found that prevalence of diarrhea headache sleep disturbance respiratory symptoms and skin problems were higher in the study group . The data suggest that there may be a protective effect of livestock exposure in general there was a lower risk of NSS closer to livestock . The study suggests that the previously identified higher risk of respiratory health problems in livestock dense areas might also apply to the prevalence of various other NSS . Longitudinal research taking into account different or more individual and contextual characteristics could possibly elucidate why prevalence of NSS in closer proximity to livestock is lower compared to people who live further away whilst a more overarching analysis indicated that living in livestock dense areas was associated with more NSS .
882,Despite a 15 year long effort to define the safety of fish intake during pregnancy there remains still uncertainty on this important public health issue . The evaluation of the toxic effects of contaminants particularly mercury in fish eating populations is complicated by the fact that sea food is also rich in beneficial nutrients such as selenium . There is toxicological plausibility of an antagonistic effects between Se and Hg and some theoretical support for the inclusion of the SeHg interaction to better assess the risk linked with fish intake . To assess the effects of exposure to low level Hg through fish consumption on the developing brain and the interaction between Hg and Se we conducted an analysis at age 40 months in Italian children enrolled in a prospective mother child cohort comparing additive and multiplicative models .
883,Residential greenness may prevent overweight obesity but the matter has not been investigated among middle aged and older adults in China . This study 1 assessed associations between residential greenness and markers of adiposity among middle aged and older Chinese adults and 2 investigated physical activity sedentary behaviours particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m between 2007 and 2010 . Overweight obesity and abdominal obesity were measured by body mass index and waist circumference . Exposure to neighbourhood greenness was measured by the normalized difference vegetation index . Multilevel structural equation models were fitted to investigate the associations between neighbourhood greenness the four potential mediators and the prevalence of overweight obesity and central obesity . The results showed that greenness was inversely associated with the odds of overweight obesity 0.580.92 and abdominal adiposity . The greenness overweight obesity association varied significantly by sex and age and the greenness central obesity varied significantly by sex age and education . We found some indication that PM Exposure to higher levels of residential greenness was associated with lower odds of overweight obesity and abdominal obesity among middle aged and older Chinese adults . However underlying mechanisms explaining these associations remain unclear requiring longitudinal studies and natural experiments .
884,Perfluoroalkyl substances are an emerging class of artificial environmental chemicals that have multiple potentially harmful effects on health . The largest Science Park in Taiwan discharges wastewater containing PFASs into the Keya River and a high concentration of PFASs has been found in this river and its aquatic creatures . We conducted a cross sectional study from 2016 to 2017 of 397 subjects aged 5575 years living near the river and evaluated the association of PFASs with metabolic syndrome and related outcomes . The results indicated that perfluorooctane sulfonate levels were positively associated with serum low density lipoprotein levels and that perfluorononanoic acid and PFOS levels were positively correlated with uric acid levels . Perfluorodecanoic acid and perfluoroundecanoic acid levels were negatively associated with serum triglyceride levels . After excluding lipid lowering drug users the association between certain PFAS levels and the LDL level was significantly enhanced but the downward trends of serum triglyceride levels were weakened . When stratified by sex PFNA perfluorohexanesulfonate and PFOS showed positive associations with the uric acid level only among males . In conclusion our results showed that associations were consistently null between PFASs and metabolic syndrome . PFAS levels were associated with serum lipids and lipid lowering drugs may interfere with this relationship . Certain PFASs were found to be positively associated with uric acid levels especially in males . Further studies are warranted to clarify the causal relationships .
885,Residential greenness exposure is associated with many health outcomes including obesity cardiovascular disease and mental disorders . However few studies have assessed the effects of greenness exposure on activities of daily living . This study evaluated the relationship between greenness and ADL among elderly residents with long term care insurance in Shanghai China . We conducted a cross sectional survey using stratified random sampling among elderly residents with LTCI in six districts of Shanghai in August 2018 . We quantitatively assessed residential greenness using satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index values with 250 500 and 1000 m buffers around each participant s residential address . We calculated the walk score to assess neighborhood walkability . Physical function was assessed using basic ADL and instrumental ADL . We performed binary logistic regression and restricted cubic splines with R software . The study participants were 1067 adults with a mean age of 82.40 years . The mean NDVI value was 0.311 . In the fully adjusted model being in the highest tertile NDVI Our results indicate the importance of residential greenness exposure to physical functionespecially for BADL disability . Well designed longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms .
886,The European Joint Program HBM4EU is a joint effort of 30 countries and the European Environment Agency co funded under the European Commission s Horizon 2020 program for advancing and implementing human biomonitoring on a European scale and for providing scientific evidence for chemical policy making . One important outcome will be a Europe wide improvement and harmonization of health risk assessment following the coordinated derivation or update of health related guidance values referring to the internal body burden . These guidance values named HBM guidance values or HBM GVs can directly be compared with HBM data . They are derived within HBM4EU for priority substances identified by the HBM4EU chemicals prioritization strategy based on existing needs to answer policy relevant questions as raised by national and EU policy makers . HBM GVs refer to both the general population and occupationally exposed adults . Reports including the detailed reasoning for the values proposals are subjected to a consultation process within all partner countries of the consortium to reach a broad scientific consensus on the derivation approach and on the derived values . The final HBM GVs should be applied first within the HBM4EU project but may also be useful for regulators and risk assessors outside this project . The subsequent adoption of derived HBM GVs at EU level needs to be discussed and decided within the responsible EU bodies . Nevertheless the establishment of HBM GVs as part of HBM4EU is already a step forward in strengthening HBM based policy efforts for public and occupational health .
887,Nearly all Americans have detectable concentrations of endocrine disrupting chemicals from consumer products in their bodies and expert panels recommend reducing exposures . To inform exposure reduction we investigated whether consumers who are trying to avoid certain chemicals in consumer products have lower exposures than those who are not . We also aimed to make exposure biomonitoring more widely available . We enrolled 726 participants in a crowdsourced biomonitoring study . We targeted phenolic compoundsspecifically parabens bisphenol A and analogs bisphenol F and bisphenol S the UV filter benzophenone 3 the anti microbial triclosan 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 5 dichlorophenoland collected survey data on consumer products cleaning habits and efforts to avoid related chemicals . We investigated associations between 68 self reported exposure behaviors and urine concentrations of ten chemicals and evaluated whether associations were modified by intention to avoid exposures . A large majority of participants reported taking steps to limit exposure to specific chemicals and overall participants achieved lower concentrations than the general U.S. population for parabens BPA triclosan and benzophenone 3 but not BPF and BPS . Participants who reported avoiding all four ingredient groupsparabens triclosan bisphenols and fragranceswere twice as likely as others to be in the lowest quartile of cumulative exposure . Avoiding certain products and reading ingredient labels to avoid chemicals was most effective for parabens triclosan and benzophenone 3 . Avoiding BPA was not effective for reducing bisphenol exposures . Avoiding certain chemicals in products was generally associated with reduced exposure for chemicals listed on labels . Greater ingredient transparency will help consumers who read labels to reduce their exposure to a wider range of potentially harmful chemicals . In order to more equitably address public health labeling policies should be complemented by regulations that exclude harmful chemicals from consumer products .
888,This follow up study of 82 children investigated the potential impact of early and recent exposure to mercury and lead on their neurodevelopmental performance at 58 years of age . Early exposure of these children to mercury methylmercury and lead was assessed during lactation at 312 months old as well as their mother s exposure using measurements from a cross sectional study . Only infants who failed to pass the neurodevelopment screening tools and or had elevated mercury were included in this study . Urine and hair were sampled during the follow up study to assess the children s recent exposure to mercury methylmercury and lead . Their cognitive performance and visual motor integration were also measured using the Test of Non Verbal Intelligence and the Beery Visual Motor Integration respectively . The association between alterations in urinary porphyrins excretion and exposure to metals was analyzed and their influence on the children s neurodevelopment was explored . Linear regression models revealed a significant negative association between the infants mercury exposure during lactation and the TONI Quotient and Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores at age 58 . The mothers blood methylmercury was inversely and significantly associated with their children s TONI Quotient . In contrast the children s Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores were positively and significantly associated with the hair methylmercury of the mothers and their infants . These relationships suggest the presence of negative confounding that we did not take into account . Unlike mercury there was some evidence that lead in breast milk had an inverse relationship with the children s visual motor coordination skills . Our study did not show a clear association between children s recent exposure to metals and neurodevelopment . However a significant inverse association was observed between the TONI Quotient and the interaction of hair methylmercuryporphyrins implying that porphyrins are a sensitive measure of low body mercury burden . Although lead induced higher porphyrins excretion in urine their interaction did not influence children s neurodevelopmental scores . The interactions between metals and porphyrins might provide insights into their potential contributory role in the pathogenesis associated with neurological disorders or other diseases . Despite the small sample size of the present study its findings about the association between toxic metal exposure and the high risk of poor neurodevelopmental performance are worrying particularly at an early age and additional research is needed using larger sample sizes .
889,The human cardiac troponin has been implicated in diverse cardiovascular diseases . The protein function is regulated by the inter subunit interaction between the N terminal domain of hcTnC and the C terminal switch peptide of hcTnI disruption of the interaction has been recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy for CDs . Here we report use of biogenic medicines as small molecule competitors to directly disrupt the proteinprotein interaction by competitively targeting the core binding site of hcTnC NTD domain . A multistep virtual screening protocol is performed against a biogenic compound library to identify competitor candidates and competition assay is employed to verify the screening results . Consequently two compounds Collismycin and Compound e are identified as strong competitors CC
890,In this paper theoretical study on molecular geometry vibrational pharmaceutical and electronic properties of the monomeric and dimeric structures of 1 benzothiophene 2 carboxylic acid were carried out using B3LYP hybrid functional with 6 311 G as basis set . The structural study show that the stability of 2BT crystalline structure arising from O HO C HO as well as S HO hydrogen bonding interactions . Vibrational analysis for monomer and dimer species show a good compatibility between experimental and theoretical frequencies . Then the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were calculated using Gauge Independent Atomic Orbital technical . In addition the UV Vis spectrum was simulated in gas phase and in water throughout TD DFT calculation . The electronic transitions were identified based on HOM LUMO energies . However donor acceptor interactions and charge delocalization has been studied via natural bond orbital . The nucleophilic and electrophilic site localization is identified by molecular electrostatic potential . Hirshfeld surface analysis has been discussed based on color code demonstrating the various non covalent interactions . Besides molecular docking analysis was reported to evince the pharmaceutical properties of the studied molecule .
891,High Mobility Group Box 1 protein is an abundant protein with multiple functions in cells acting as a DNA chaperone and damage associated molecular pattern molecule . It represents an attractive target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers . The plant natural product glycyrrhizin is a well characterized ligand of HMGB1 and a drug used to treat diverse liver and skin diseases . The drug is known to bind to each of the two adjacent HMG boxes of the non glycosylated protein . In cells HMGB1 is N glycosylated at three asparagine residues located in boxes A and B and these N glycans are essential for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the protein . But the impact of the N glycans on drug binding is unknown . Here we have investigated the effect of the N glycosylation of HMGB1 on its interaction with GLR using molecular modelling after incorporation of three N glycans on a Human HMGB1 structure . Sialylated bi antennary N glycans were introduced on the protein and exposed in a folded or an extended conformation for the drug binding study . The docking of the drug was performed using both 18 and 18 epimers of GLR and the conformations and potential energy of interaction of the different drug protein complexes were compared . The N glycans do not shield the drug binding sites on boxes A and B but can modulate the drug protein interaction via both direct and indirect effects . The calculations indicate that binding of 18 GLR to the HMG box is generally reduced when the protein is N glycosylated vs. the non glycosylated protein . In particular the N glycans in an extended configuration significantly weaken the binding of GLR to box B . The effects of the N glycans are mostly indirect but in one case a direct contact with the drug via a carbohydrate carbohydrate interaction was observed with 18 GLR bound to Box B of glycosylated HMGB1 . For the first time it is shown that N glycosylation one of the many post translational modifications of HMGB1 can affect drug binding .
892,It has become obvious that fluorinated drugs have a significant role in medicinal applications . In this study the fluorination of 3 nitrotyrosine as an anti Parkinson and anti Alzheimer drug was explored using density functional theory calculations . We have investigated the most important chemical properties of 3 nitrotyrosine that affect the pharmacological activity of the drug . We found that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intramolecular charge of the drug were influenced by fluorine substitution . Our results also reveal that the fluorination altered the stability solubility and molecular polarity of the 3 nitrotyrosine drug . The density of state analysis also determines sharp resonance states of fluorine atoms with the 3 nitrotyrosine drug states particularly in the highest molecular orbital reigns suggesting hybridization of the fluorine states with the state of the drug . Moreover our results show that the electronic spectra of fluorinated derivatives of 3 nitrotyrosine drug exhibit a red shift toward higher wavelengths . Our calculations show that the free energy transfers of fluorinated derivatives of the 3 nitrotyrosine drug in water were negative that it meant that the designed molecules dissolving in aqueous phase occurred simultaneously . Consequently the results of the present study show that the fluorination of 3 nitrotyrosine drug could be considered as a promising strategy to design useful drugs with better pharmacological properties .
893,Human Rho associated coiled coil forming kinase is a class of essential neurokinases that consists of two structurally conserved isoforms ROCK I and ROCK II they have been revealed to play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease and other neurological disorders . Selective targeting of the two kinase isoforms with small molecule inhibitors is a great challenge due to the surprisingly high homology in kinase domain and the full identity in kinase active site . Here we describe a computational protocol to systematically profile the selectivity of Fasudil and its 25 analogs between the two kinase isoforms . It is suggested that the substitution of Fasudils 1 4 diazepane moiety with rigid ring such as Ripasudil and Dimehtylfasudil would render the resulting inhibitors of ROCK II over ROCK I

895,Protein ligand docking is an essential process that has accelerated drug discovery . How to accurately and effectively optimize the predominant position and orientation of ligands in the binding pocket of a target protein is a major challenge . This paper proposed a novel ligand binding pose search method called FWAVina based on the fireworks algorithm which combined the fireworks algorithm with the efficient Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon local search method adopted in AutoDock Vina to address the pose search problem in docking . The FWA was used as a global optimizer to rapidly search promising poses and the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon method was incorporated into FWAVina to perform an exact local search . FWAVina was developed and tested on the PDBbind and DUD E datasets . The docking performance of FWAVina was compared with the original Vina program . The results showed that FWAVina achieves a remarkable execution time reduction of more than 50 than Vina without compromising the prediction accuracies in the docking and virtual screening experiments . In addition the increase in the number of ligand rotatable bonds has almost no effect on the efficiency of FWAVina . The higher accuracy faster convergence and improved stability make the FWAVina method a better choice of docking tool for computer aided drug design . The source code is available at

898,The rapid development of computational methods and the increasing volume of chemical and biological data have contributed to an immense growth in chemical research . This field of study is known as chemoinformatics which is a discipline that uses machine learning techniques to extract process and extrapolate data from chemical structures . One of the significant lines of research in chemoinformatics is the study of bloodbrain barrier permeability which aims to identify drug penetration into the central nervous system . In this research we attempt to solve the problem of BBB permeability by predicting compounds penetration to the CNS . To accomplish this goal First an overview is provided to the field of chemoinformatics its definition applications and challenges Second a broad view is taken to investigate previous machine learning and deep learning computational models to solve BBB permeability . Based on the analysis of previous models three main challenges that collectively affect the classifier performance are identified which we define as the triple constraints subsequently we map each constraint to a proposed solution Finally we conclude this endeavor by proposing a deep learning based Recurrent Neural Network model to predict BBB permeability . Our model outperformed other studies from the literature by scoring an overall accuracy of 96.53 and a specificity score of 98.08 . The obtained results confirm that addressing the triple constraints substantially improves the classification model capability specifically when predicting compounds with low penetration .
899,Comparison of compounds similarity is one of the main strategies of virtual screening protocols . Both similarity and dissimilarity concepts are of great importance during the search for new active compounds . Similarity is important due to the assumption that underlies the process of searching for new drug candidates structurally similar compounds should induce similar biological response . On the other hand we are also interested in dissimilarity as we usually aim to find structurally novel ligands . In the study we compared several approaches of evaluating compound similarity . Various representations and metrics were applied and we indicated the rate of variation of the results that can occur when shifting from one strategy to another . We compared both general similarity of datasets using different approaches as well as examined the changes in the set of nearest neighbors when changing one compound representation into another and the influence of representation metric settings on the clustering outcome . We hope that the study will be of great help during the preparation of virtual screening experiments stressing the need for careful selection of the way the compound similarity is assessed . The differences in the results that can be obtained via the application of particular strategy can significantly influence the outcome of comparison studies therefore its settings should be carefully selected beforerunning the comparison .

These data have helped in understanding some of the complicated life process from a systematic level . Many diseases are generated by abnormalities in multiple regulating processes . In this study we constructed a novel miRNAgenedisease fusion algorithm by integrating three genome wide networks namely microRNA gene function and disease similarity networks . The data fusion method was applied to construct a miRNAgenedisease association network model from these networks to explore miRNAdisease associations mediated by genes with similar functions . mmiRNAs bind to their target genes and regulate their expression so the miRNAgene and genedisease regulatory relationships were included in the network model to more accurately predict miRNAdisease associations . The proposed MGDF was used to predict miRNAcancer associations and the results show that most of the predicted associations had evidence in existing databases .

We also explain the most useful services of the Cloud that can be used for microRNA analysis . At the same time we review several solutions for microRNA and show that the utilization of the Cloud in this field is still weak but can increase in the future when the awareness of their applicability grows .

906,Plant fungal diseases have been affecting the world s agricultural production and economic levels for a long time such as rice blast gray tomato mold potato late blight etc . Recent studies have shown that fungal pathogens transmit microRNA as an effector to host plants for infection . However bioassay based verification analysis is time consuming and challenging and it is difficult to analyze from a global perspective .

In this study a network pharmacology based approach was used that integrated drug likeness evaluation oral bioavailability prediction target exploration network construction bioinformatic annotation and molecular docking to investigate the mechanisms that underlie motherwort treatment for MDs . In total 29 bioactive compounds were collected from 51 compounds in motherwort which shared 17 common MDs related targets . Network analysis indicated that motherwort played a therapeutic role in MDs treatment through multiple components that acted on multiple targets . Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the putative targets of motherwort were primarily involved in various pathways associated with the endocrine system cancers vascular system and anti inflammation process . Notably five targets were screened as hub genes based on a degree algorithm . Moreover most of the bioactive components in motherwort had good binding ability with these genes implying that motherwort could regulate their biological function . Collectively this study elucidated the molecular mechanisms that underlay the efficiency of motherwort against MDs and demonstrated the potential of network pharmacology as an approach to uncover the action mechanism of herbal medicines .
908,Conotoxins are small peptide toxins which are rich in disulfide and have the unique diversity of sequences . It is significant to correctly identify the types of ion channel targeted conotoxins because that they are considered as the optimal pharmacological candidate medicine in drug design owing to their ability specifically binding to ion channels and interfering with neural transmission . Comparing with other feature extracting methods the reduced amino acid cluster better resolved in simplifying protein complexity and identifying functional conserved regions . Thus in our study 673 RAACs generated from 74 types of reduced amino acid alphabet were comprehensively assessed to establish a state of the art predictor for predicting ion channel targeted conotoxins . The results showed Type 20 Cluster 9 in the tripeptide composition achieved the best accuracy 89.3 which was based on the algorithm of amino acids reduction of variance maximization . Further the ANOVA with incremental feature selection was used for feature selection to improve prediction performance . Finally the cross validation results showed that the best overall accuracy we calculated was 96.4 and 1.8 higher than the best accuracy of previous studies . Based on the predictor we proposed a user friendly webserver was established and can be friendly accessed at

However the expression levels of RUNX2 mRNA and protein in lung adenocarcinoma were not investigated . This study aims to thoroughly analysis the expression level and potential mechanisms of RUNX2 mRNA in LUAD . We applied in house immunohistochemistry high throughput RNA sequencing and gene microarrays to comprehensively investigate the expression level of RUNX2 in LUAD . A pool standard mean difference and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to assess the integrated expression value of RUNX2 in LUAD . The hazard ratios were integrated to evaluate the overall prognostic effect of RUNX2 on the LUAD patients . The differentially expressed genes of LUAD the potential target genes of RUNX2 and its co expressed genes were overlapped to obtain a set of specific genes for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses . RUNX2 overexpression in LUAD was validated using a large number of cases . The pooled SMD was 0.85 and the area under the curve of the SROC was 0.86 . The integrated HR was 1.20 indicating that increased expression of RUNX2 was an independent risk factor for the poor survival of the LUAD patients . RUNX2 and its transcriptionally regulates potential target genes may promote cell proliferation and drug resistance of LUAD by modulating the cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathways . RUNX2 can provide new research directions for targeted drug therapy and drug resistance for LUAD treatment .
910,A non coding RNA is a kind of RNA that is not converted into protein however it is involved in many biological processes diseases and cancers . Numerous ncRNAs have been identified and classified with high throughput sequencing technology . Hence accurate ncRNAs class prediction is important and necessary for further study of their functions . Several computation techniques have been employed to predict the class of ncRNAs . Recent classification methods used the secondary structure as their primary input . However the computational tools of RNA secondary structure are not accurate enough which affects the final performance of ncRNAs predictors . In this paper we propose a simple yet efficient method called ncRDeep for ncRNAs prediction . It uses a simple convolutional neural network and RNA sequence information only . The ncRDeep was evaluated on benchmark datasets and the comparison results showed that the ncRDeep outperforms the state of the art methods significantly . More specifically the average accuracy was improved by 8.32 . Finally we built a freely accessible web server for the developed tool ncRDeep at
911,The aim of the study was to comprehensively evaluate the associations between tumor necrosis factor gene polymorphism and influenza A susceptibility .

913,As a large group of small non coding RNAs Piwi interacting RNAs have been detected to be associated with various diseases . Identifying disease associated piRNAs can provide promising candidate molecular targets to promote the drug design . Although a few computational ensemble methods have been developed for identifying piRNA disease associations the low quality negative associations even with positive associations used during the training process prevent the predictive performance improvement . In this study we proposed a new computational predictor named iPiDA sHN to predict potential piRNA disease associations . iPiDA sHN presented the piRNA disease pairs by incorporating piRNA sequence information the known piRNA disease association network and the disease semantic graph . High level features of piRNA disease associations were extracted by the Convolutional Neural Network . Two step positive unlabeled learning strategy based on Support Vector Machine was employed to select the high quality negative samples from the unknown piRNA disease pairs . Finally the SVM predictor trained with the known piRNA disease associations and the high quality negative associations was used to predict new piRNA disease associations . The experimental results showed that iPiDA sHN achieved superior predictive ability compared with other state of the art predictors .
914,Perfect annealing between microRNAs and messenger RNAs was computationally searched at a broad scale in the human genome to determine whether theoretical pairing is restrictively represented in functional subnetworks or is randomly distributed . Massive RNA interference pairing motifs in genes constitute a remarkable subnetwork that displays highly genetically and biochemically interconnected genes . These analyses show unexpected repertoires of genes defined by their congruence in comatching with miRNAs at numerous sites and by their interconnection based on protein protein interactions or proteins regulating the activity of others . This offers insights into the putatively coregulated homeostasis of large networks of genes by RNAi whereas other networks seem to be independent of this regulatory mode . Genes accordingly defined by theoretical RNAi pairing cluster mainly in subnetworks related to cellular metabolic and developmental processes and their regulation . Indeed genes harboring numerous potential sites of hybridization with miRNAs are highly enriched with GO terms depicting the abovementioned processes and are grouped in a subnetwork of genes that are significantly more highly connected than they would be according to a random distribution . The significant number of interacting genes that present numerous potential comatches with miRNAs suggests that they may be under the control of the integrative and concerted action of multiple miRNAs .
915,MicroRNA plays an important role in life processes . In recent years predicting the association between miRNAs and diseases has become a research hotspot . However biological experiments take a lot of time and cost to identify pathogenic miRNAs . Computational biology based methods can effectively improve accuracy of recognition .

On benchmark dataset the results of our method are comparable and even better than existing models .
916,The Programmed cell Death protein 1 Ligand 1 checkpoint is a major target in oncology . Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD 1 or PD L1 are used to treat different types of solid tumors and lymphoma . PD L1 binding small molecules are also actively searched . The lead compound is the biphenyl drug BMS 202 which stabilizes PD L1 protein dimers and displays a potent antitumor activity in experimental models . Here we have investigated the effect of N glycosylation and mono ubiquitination of PD L1 on the interaction with BMS 202 by molecular modeling . Two complementary tridimensional models of PD L1 based on available crystallographic structures were constructed with BMS 202 bound . The structures were glycosylated with a fucosylated bi antennary N glycan and ubiquitinated . Model 1 refers to glycoPD L1 bearing 16 N glycans with or without 4 ubiquitin residues . Model 2 presents 8 N glycans and 2 ubiquitin residues . In both cases BMS 202 was bound to the protein interface stabilizing a PD L1 dimer . The incorporation of the N glycans or the ubiquitins did not significantly alter the drug protein recognition . The interface of the drug stabilized protein dimer is unaffected by the glycosylation or ubiquitination . Calculations of the binding energies indicated that the glycosylation slightly reduces the stability of the drug protein complexes but does not prevent the drug binding process . Our modeling study suggests that the drug can target efficiently the different forms of PD L1 in cells glycosylated ubiquitinated or not . These models of N glycosylated and ubiquitinated PD L1 will be useful to study other PD L1 protein complexes .

918,We previously reported that activating transcription factor 3 an adaptive response gene plays a dichotomous role in regulating several molecular processes during breast cancer progression . ATF3 promoted the expression of runt related transcription factor 2 and activated matrix metalloproteinase 13 thereby fostering proliferation and bone metastasis of the breast cancer cells . Targeting ATF3 may mitigate the metastatic spread of breast cancer and improve the patients lifespan . Non coding RNAs such as microRNAs long non coding RNAs and circular RNAs are the new era regimens that are currently utilized for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of malignancies including cancer . mir 3674 putatively targets ATF3 but its expression was significantly increased in human breast cancer cells compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells . Our in silico analysis identified a few lncRNAs and circRNAs showing their putative binding sites for miR 3674 . Thus mir 3674 despite its abundance in the MDA MB231 cells could not effectively target ATF3 which could be due to the sponging mechanism of lncRNAs and circRNAs towards mir 3674 . More extensive in vitro and in vivo studies are required to validate this and expand the diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives of breast cancer .

920,Thermal and hygroscopic environments inside a duck house are two of the most important factors directly related to their productivity and energy costs . However few quantitative analyses of these environments have been performed . The objective of this study was to develop a dynamic energy model for the combined and real time quantitative analysis of thermal and hygroscopic environments inside a mechanically ventilated duck house . To identify seasonal problems and develop the energy model the internal and external environments of the duck house were first monitored via field experiments . Additionally chamber experiments were conducted in a temperature and humidity controlled chamber to calculate the amount of evaporation from duck house litter for incorporation of these data into the energy model . According to the environmental data measured in the field experiments and the results of the chamber experiments the dynamic energy model of the duck house was developed using building energy simulation . The BES model was validated by comparison of the BES computed and field measured data of the air temperature and relative humidity . The results showed errors of 1.71 and 4.33 for the air temperature and relative humidity respectively . Finally the validated BES model of the duck house was used to analyse the seasonal periodic and maximum energy loads . Furthermore the high temperature stress of the ducks in summer was also estimated for different space allowances
921,The 3D characterisation of individual vine canopies with a LiDAR sensor requires point cloud classification . A Bayesian point cloud classification algorithm is proposed that combines an automatic filtering method and a classification method based on clustering to process LiDAR data . Data were collected on several grape varieties with two different modes of training . To evaluate the quality of the BPCC algorithm and its influence on the estimation of canopy parameters it was compared to an expert manual method and to an established semi automatic research method requiring interactive pre treatment . The results showed that the AFM filtering was similar to the expert manual method and retained on average 9 more points than the PROTOLIDAR method over the whole growing season .

922,Near infrared hyperspectral imaging over the spectral range of 9002500nm was investigated for its potential to identify maize kernels inoculated with aflatoxigenic fungus from healthy kernels and kernels inoculated with non aflatoxigenic fungus . A total of 900 kernels were used with 3 treatments namely each 300 kernels inoculated with AF13 AF36 and sterile distilled water as control separately . One hundred kernels from each treatment of 300 kernels were incubated for 3 5 and 8 days to obtain diverse samples . Based on the full mean spectra extracted from the same kernel side the best mean overall prediction accuracies achieved were 96.3 for the 3 class classification and 97.8 for the 2 class classification using the partial least squares discriminant analysis method . The 3 class and 2 class models using the full mean spectra extracted from different kernel sides had the best mean overall prediction accuracies of 91.5 and 95.1 . Using the most important 30 55 and 100 variables determined by the random frog algorithm the simplified type I RF PLSDA models achieved the mean overall prediction accuracies of 87.7 93.8 and 95.2 for the 2 class discrimination using different kernel sides information . Among the most important 55 and 100 variables a total of 25 and 67 variables were consistently selected in the 100 random runs and were therefore used further for establishing the type II RF PLSDA models . Using these 25 and 67 variables the type II RF PLSDA models obtained the mean overall prediction accuracies of 82.3 and 94.9 separately .
923,Commercial sand media filters adopt different underdrain designs with pod wand and spike designs being the most common . Studies about the consequences of using these configurations are often not conclusive since auxiliary elements and dimensions vary between filters . Here computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out comparing underdrain designs in filters with equal sized diffuser plates and same inlet inner and outlet diameters . Seven underdrain pod type designs were analysed ranging from a market model to one with more than 50 of pods . Designs with equal number of pods but with different spatial distributions were investigated . Two wand and two spike type underdrain models were also evaluated . The main variables analysed were pressure and volumetric flowrate . Results confirmed that the flow uniformity through the filter was crucial to achieve low pressure drop values . Pressure losses through the sand were the most important contribution to the filter pressure drop for all cases . The water only region at the inlet had low relevance in terms of pressure losses . All underdrain designs had similar pressure drops at the exit collector chamber or pipe . Pod type designs with the same slot open area as wand and spike type configurations clearly had a better efficiency since wand and spike type designs had faces opposing the incoming flow . Pod and spike type designs with similar horizontal projected upward slot areas behaved alike in both filtration and backwashing modes with a better performance for the spike type configuration . Recommended spike type designs should cover most of the filter cross sectional area .
924,Global climate change has in recent years increased the frequency and intensity of meteorological disasters . In particular damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall continues to occur on farms in South Korea . Because heavy snowfall occurs over a relatively long time compared to other sudden meteorological disasters if an appropriate warning system for heavy snowfall events is in place then damage to greenhouses can be prevented . However the existing snowfall warning system in South Korea consists only of a simple alert that is unable to anticipate future risks to an area caused by heavy snowfall . In this study the aim was to develop a stochastic alarm model to minimise the damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall events . A Markov chain was designed to construct the alarm model using snowfall data from nationwide weather stations as well as from greenhouse standards with various safety criteria . The snow depth data were divided into several sections using a cluster analysis and the failure probabilities of the greenhouses were derived for specific time interval according to current snow depth . This method considers the weather characteristics of each region as well as various greenhouse standards because the risks of heavy snowfall vary depending on location and type of the installation . Using the alarm model developed in this study it is possible to predict and therefore manage the negative impacts of heavy snowfall events on greenhouses .

We review the current literature on pathophysiology diagnosis management and nursing implications of vaping related lung disease .
930,Few data are published about different ferret husbandry practices in terms of housing enrichment feeding social management and the health status of ferrets . However these factors are crucial for animal welfare and influence animal behavior . A comprehensive online survey was conducted among 573 German speaking ferret owners to gain insight into these aspects of husbandry the occurrence of behaviors potentially indicative of good or impaired welfare and associations between environmental conditions and ferret behavior . To reduce reactance in participants a forced choice answer format was avoided therefore the sample size varied . Ferrets were on average 3.3 2.3 years old . 56 were male and 44 were female . 89 of the male and 83 of the female ferrets were neutered . Many ferrets enjoyed good health . Most ferrets were not diagnosed with a ferret typical illness . A high percentage of animals were housed in a dedicated ferret room or unconfined in the flat or house . The vast majority had various enrichment items in their main living area . Potential stressors and welfare issues were also identified recent bite injuries from other ferrets ferret typical diseases such as cardiac disease and adrenal tumors or recent signs of ill health such as diarrhea or parasites and potential problem behaviors which might strain the human animal relationship such as defecation outside the toilet area . The mean age of the latest deceased ferret was 5.8 2.6years hinting at a shorter life span than often predicted . Both housing type and recent changes in the pair or group composition that is in the social environment were shown to have an effect on behavior . For instance repetitive nibbling was reported more often in ferrets living in indoor enclosures compared with animals kept in ferret rooms unconfined in the flat house or outdoor enclosures

In this study we used a highly conductive ZnO film via a low temperature process to improve the electron transport behavior of the QLEDs . The electron transport behavior of ZnO film was investigated from the electron only device and the origin of high conductivity was figured out using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy . We found that the oxygen vacancy which can improve the carrier transport in ZnO film was increased according to reduce the process temperature of ZnO . Meanwhile the hydroxyl group which contribute to the quenching effect was decreased according to reduce the process temperature of ZnO . Therefore high performance QLEDs were fabricated using the low temperature processed ZnO and it showed an improved luminance and current efficiency in a full current range .

Thus the influence of AuNP size surface AuNP coverage NP NP spacing and NS thickness on the localized electric field was analyzed in details . The LSP resonance between NP NS has been predicted to be the most important effect on SERS which is dominant stable and can maintain the SERS intensity even at a relatively low NP coverage . If a slight deviation of AuNPs away from their original periodic positions was permitted a disordered model was then constructed which would more closely approximate the real AuNP NS hybrid structure and was able to calculate the influence of disorder on LSP resonance . A blue shift of the resonance peak was observed and its peak intensity would increase first and decrease then with the increase of NP NP spacing . FDTD simulations have finally illustrated that NP coverage should be controlled ranging from 80.0 to 87.0 or just equal to 100 if both AuNP size and NP thickness is controlled to 10nm . The FDTD simulation results are qualitative agreement with the existing experimental data and are very useful in the future materials designs for AuNS based nanocomposite .

967,The paper is devoted to optical testing of mid infrared Ge Si photodetectors obtained by stacking of self assembled Ge quantum dots in multilayer structures which are near field coupled to the adjacent nanoplasmonic arrays of subwavelength holes in metallic films . It is shown that photocurrent and near field spectra consist of several sets of peaks which are attributted to surface plasmon waves localized surface plasmon modes or diffractive Rayleigh anomaly depending on the hole diameter and the angle of incidence . We find that for small holes the greatest contribution to the photocurrent enhancement is due to the excitation of the surface plasmon polariton waves for all . As the hole diameter is increased and becomes comparable with the array periodicity the normal incident photoresponse improvement is provided by the Rayleigh anomaly . With the increase of incident angle the photocurrent enhancement is supposed to arise from coupling of the localized shape resonance and propagating plasmon modes .

Moreover the sensitivity study reveals that Nano islands of noble metals substantially affects the sensitivity of the sensors . The decorated Gold nano island Al ZnO Ethanol sensor has the highest response showing an amount of 45 . The response of Al ZnO and Silver decorated Al ZnO sensors are virtually identical to all concentrations of Ethanol whereas the Al ZnO gas sensor with Gold nano islands has the substantial sensitivity for different concentrations .

995,The gate induced drain leakage effect in negative capacitance FinFET is investigated . A LandauGinzburgDevonshire equation is used to estimate the characteristics of the NC FinFET . Specifically metal ferroelectric metal insulator semiconductor and metal ferroelectric insulator semiconductor NC FinFETs are compared in order to figure out the effect of the internal metal layer on the GIDL effect . To analyze the impact of the polarization gradient on the GIDL effect in NC FinFET a polarization gradient coefficient is varied . For MFMIS the polarization gradient doesn t significantly affect the device performance . The subthreshold swing improves but the GIDL effect deteriorates because of the uniform NC effect in channel region . For MFIS the device performance is explicitly affected by the polarization gradient . Smaller polarization gradients result in non uniform NC effect in channel region resulting in severe GIDL effects . On the other hand higher polarization gradients alleviate GIDL effects .

1002,In this study we examined the influence of using hetero gate dielectrics on the short channel effects in scaled tunnel field effect transistors . For bulk TFETs the short channel performance is not influenced by the HGD engineering because the SCEs are caused by the tunneling at the region with negligible gate control . However the use of the HGD increases the SCEs in double gate TFETs because the HGD reduces the gate control on the channel . When the HGD optimized in term of on current is used the channel of HGD TFETs is about 10 nm longer than that of uniform gate dielectric TFETs to obtain similar SCEs . The SCEs in HGD TFETs can be improved by locating the drain side heterojunction toward the drain and or increasing the ratio of low and high
1003,It is well known that carrier distribution in InGaN multiple quantum wells can be significantly inhomogeneous . However the conventional ABC recombination model assumes that carriers are uniformly distributed throughout the MQW . In this paper a modified ABC model that considers the unequal carrier density in the QWs was developed . From the analysis of the developed ABC model the effective recombination coefficients and modified internal quantum efficiency were obtained for an arbitrary carrier distribution in MQWs . The efficiency droop was found to be aggravated as the carrier distribution was increasingly inhomogeneous . However it was also found that the effect of inhomogeneous carrier distribution alone was not sufficient to explain the IQE droop with the theoretical Auger recombination coefficient based on indirect Auger processes . The developed ABC model is expected to provide insight into the influence of inhomogeneous carrier distributions in MQWs on the efficiency droop in GaN based light emitting diodes .

Gold nanorods with two different aspect ratios derived from different lengths and diameters were synthesized using seed mediated growth method and the aspect ratio was controlled by changing the silver ion concentration in growth solution . The morphological and size measurement was performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy and the average value of aspect ratio was found to be 3.0 and 3.2 for GNR1 and GNR2 respectively . The characteristics transverse and longitudinal mode of localized surface plasmon resonance have been clearly depicted in UVvis absorption spectrum of both GNR1 and GNR2 . The red shift in longitudinal mode of LSPR from 718 to 732nm has been observed for GNR with change in aspect ratio from 3.0 to 3.2 respectively . These samples of GNR were tested for liquid ammonia sensing with concentration ranging from 100 to 500ppm . A clear cut blue shift in longitudinal mode of LSPR of prepared gold nanorod was observed . However the GNR2 was found to be more sensitive toward liquid ammonia sensing . The origin of such blue shifting and sensitivity of longitudinal mode of LSPR of gold nanorod was explained on the basis of orientation dependence and Dipolar Exciton Coupling Model of coupled plasmon in assemblies of anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles . With the help of this model blue shifting in longitudinal plasmon band was correlated with the enhanced formation of H aggregation induced by dipolar coupling of GNR clusters followed by hydrogen bonding after successive addition of ammonia solution .

The hyperbolic waveguides allow obtaining a single double and multimode resonant structures trapping photons at various frequencies as explored in the form of sharp spectral resonances within the photoluminescence spectrum bandwidth of the dye molecules . Experimental results reveal that the coupling of the fluorescent emitters into multimode localizations in each hyperbolic waveguide corresponds to obtaining quasi optical cavities at various resonant frequencies which alter the emission characteristics of the emitters distinctively . The spontaneous emission rate of the dye molecules coupled into the isolated transverse Anderson localized modes is observed to increase by a factor of up to 6.7 thus the vacuum fluctuations at certain resonant wavelengths are considerably enhanced .

Reducing the bending radius of the SOI waveguides with low bending loss is essential in minimizing the footprint of light wave circuits . The propagating mode is less confined in the core of the ultra thin SOI waveguide and penetrates to substrate and cladding leading to higher bending loss compared to conventional SOI waveguides with a thicker guiding layer . Although various bending mechanisms have been utilized to reduce the bending loss of conventional SOI waveguides the ultra thin SOI waveguide bends have not been studied in detail .

1035,The process of aggregation of two colloidal quantum dots in the field of quasiresonant laser radiation is investigated via computer simulation . The cases of either completely deterministic movement of particles or the movement with the account for random forces are considered . The conditions of pair formation are determined in dependence on initial interparticle distance on laser wavelength and on their initial orientation with respect to polarization plane of laser radiation . It is shown that despite velocity of thermal motion dominates over the velocity of directional diffusion of quantum dots the account for random forces weakly influences on the probability of pair formation the latter being close to results obtained in the deterministic case . The reason for this weak influence of Brownian movement is the resonant increase of electrodynamics attraction force during certain time interval within the laser pulse .

Finally while considering all the radiative and non radiative recombinations the continuity and drift diffusion equations were solved to find the dark and photo currents . The results indicated that applying quantum wells to the traditional classical solar cells could noticeably increase the systems efficiency . Additionally it was found that efficiency was heavily dependent on the values of different geometrical parameters including the active layers thickness and the width of the wells and barriers . Moreover it was shown that modifying some structural parameters such as the barrier mole fraction could noticeably influence the solar cells characteristics . Therefore to obtain good efficiency it is necessary to optimize these parameters .
1044,In this paper the behavior of radiation including the reconfiguration capability of planar metallic antenna structure using graphene in the microwave and terahertz frequency range is investigated . Different from the conventional reconfigurable metal planar antenna and graphene plasmonic THz antenna designs this planar microstrip metal antenna structure is realized by placing a graphene layer in between the copper radiator and silicon dielectric . The design is inspired by the tunable conductivity behavior of graphene that can be achieved by applying a DC bias voltage across it . The antenna performance parameters such as frequency reconfiguration VSWR input impedance efficiency and radiation pattern are studied in both MW and THz frequencies . The radiation properties of the proposed antenna are studied at both MW and THz spectra by tuning the graphene conductivity via Fermi energy . It is found that at MW and THz frequency with respect to the unbiased condition the antenna radiation efficiency is enhanced from 16 to 66 and from 26 to 69 respectively with the increase of Fermi energy from 0.5 eV to 0.8 eV . The efficiency of the antenna at both MW and THz can be further improved with the rise of the Fermi level of graphene . Moreover the graphene based planar metal antenna structure provides easy frequency reconfiguration in the THz band due to its unique electronic and plasmonic properties at this frequency range whereas the presence of the graphene parasitic layer below metal radiator improves the impedance matching and radiation of the antenna at MW band .

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses showed that the rhodamine 6G peaks with PAFG1 were 1.75 times larger than those with trinitrotoluene and 1.7 times larger than those with pyrene . SERS analysis of TNT with PAFG2 obtained 1.49 and 1.3 times greater peaks compared with those using pyrene and R6G respectively . On average the performance was around 1.4 times better with PAFG2 for each of the analytes . Measurements of the SERS spectra for TNT and pyrene with annealed PAFG showed that the enhancement factors were 2.2 and 1.7 for the M TNT and pyrene samples respectively . Comparisons of the SERS spectra obtained for mM samples of the three analytes with annealed PAFG showed that the EFs were over three times higher than that with R6G .
1046,A novel hybrid all optical infrared switch based on metal insulator metal plasmonic and one dimensional photonic crystal structures is introduced in this paper . A photonic crystal lattice composed of two different Kerr materials is located at the center of the switch . Two plasmonic metal insulator metal waveguides are used to transfer the data signal . Also two dielectric waveguides are used as input and output pump ports . The existence of two separate paths for data and pump signals results in good isolation between such signals . The photonic crystal lattice creates a photonic bandgap region with sharp transmission edges in the data signal path . The created edges in data signal path can be used for the switching mechanism . The proposed structure can operate as an all optical switch using different Kerr materials . The benefits of the proposed switch are having isolated signal and control ports and also its versatile topology . The switch can easily be redesigned and adapted with different Kerr materials for different applications . Furthermore since a hybrid photonic crystal plasmonic topology is used it benefits both from the advantages of plasmonic and PhC structures . Based on the mentioned advantages the proposed switch can be used as a basis to design other complex optical circuits .
1047,Magnetic resonance images spatial resolution which is a key factor in early diagnosis of many diseases is fundamentally limited by the signal to noise ratio which in turn depends upon the efficiency of the receive radiofrequency coils design . Many various multi channel coils were designed to improve the quality of MR images . Another way to enhance the quality of magnetic resonance imaging is the implementation of resonators based on novel materials such as high permittivity dielectrics . Here we investigate the potential for the sensitivity enhancement with higher order modes of dielectric resonators . We numerically show that because of the unique near field spatial distribution of a dielectric resonator third order mode the receive performance can be substantially improved in comparison with a conventional metallic loop coil of the same dimensions . Moreover we study the performance of the dielectric resonator in comparison with a metallic loop coil which size was optimized to match the sensitivity of the resonator at a particular distance . We demonstrate a 9 fold larger planar field of view with the dielectric resonator than with the loop coil . Our work provides the design guidelines for the improvement of near field MRI sensitivity with the dielectric resonators .
1048,Light angular momentum is used to characterize the dynamical rotation of electromagnetic wave as spin angular momentum describes its polarization rotation while orbital angular momentum describes its phase rotation . Though various methods have been proposed to detect light spin or orbital angular momentum independently it is still a challenge to determine both of them simultaneously . Here based on orthogonal nanoslit pairs located in semi ring array we design an on chip simultaneous light spin and orbital angular momentum detector which can generate focus at different positions sensitive to light angular momenta thus both spin and orbital angular momenta of the indecent light can be determined . It is verified that spin angular momenta of 1 and orbital angular momenta in wide detection range can be simultaneously determined in high accuracy moreover mixed light with multiple spin and orbital angular momenta can also be distinguished . Therefore the proposed detector provides a way to determine light angular momenta in nanoscale and can be future applied in the fields of on chip photonics and plasmonics .

1052,The design flexibility of Hollow Core Photonic Crystal Fibres is a significant feature that allows the fibres to achieve excellent optical properties . Changes in the design parameters of HC PCFs used for gas sensing can affect their optical and gas flow properties . The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of three HC PCFs with different geometries in terms of their optical mode and gas flow performance . The numerical model for the optical mode analysis is presented . The optical performance of three HC PCFs is examined at different wavelengths in terms of their effective refractive index mode field diameter confinement loss and relative sensitivity . The numerical model for gas flow simulations based on Navier Stokes and gas diffusion equations is also presented . This model is used to examine the gas velocity relative average concentration volumetric flow rate and gas filling time for three different HC PCFs and three different gases . A series of gas sensing experiments based on pulsed continuous wave modulated photothermal spectroscopy is conducted to validate the gas flow numerical model . A comparison between the three HC PCFs indicates that the HC PCF with the smallest size is associated with the lowest confinement loss but the highest gas filling time .
1053,A six port path reconfigurable circulator based on Y type plasma photonic crystals has been proposed . By calculating and analyzing the transfer matrix equation of the transverse magnetic waves it can be concluded that the anisotropy generated by the magnetized plasma enables the TM waves to produce elliptical polarization . Therefore the plasma columns are introduced in the design of a circulator . This circulator is constituted of six Y type junctions . The direction of the magnetic field can be individually controlled by each junction . Therefore the proposed path reconfigurable circulator employs six Y type junctions to realize the five paths reconfigurability when TM waves incident from the same port . The transmission characteristics of the circulator are simulated . The results show that the designed magnetized PPC can achieve the aim of five paths reconfigurable with the insertion losses of output port 2 to output port 6 are 0.889 dB 1.18 dB 1.26 dB 1.29 dB and 1.79 dB at operating frequency of 0.4882 .
1054,Metal organic frameworks represent a unique platform for fabrication of nanoparticles of diverse composition and crystallinity . The growth of NPs from constituent parts of MOFs is usually initiated by external stimuli such as temperature light and electron irradiation . Herein the kinetics and NP growth mechanisms remain unexplored . Here we utilized electron irradiation to initiate the nucleation and growth of crystalline Cu NPs of tunable size from several nanometers to hundreds of nanometers inside MOF as a precursor . Simultaneously the process of the NPs growth captured in real time using transmission electron microscope demonstrates the evolution of their size shape and spatial distribution . We also analyze the NP growth by the classical kinetic theory taking into account a phase transformation . Our results contribute to crystal engineering and developing of functional MOF based nanocomposites .
1055,In the present work some optical properties related to intersubband transitions in finite depth asymmetric hyperbolic type quantum wells are theoretically investigated . The use of a hyperbolic potential configuration would account for the actual non abrupt confinement potential in the heterostructure in the case of modulated growing or when compositional diffusion across the interfaces turns out to be relevant . In the investigation the presence of externally applied electromagnetic fields is considered . Electron conduction band states are determined within the parabolic band an effective mass approximation . With the electronic structure information at hand it is possible to evaluate the linear and third order nonlinear light absorption and relative refractive index change coefficients from expression arising in the framework of the compact density matrix approach . According to the theoretical outcome it is found that There is a significant influence of the structural configuration on the magnitude and resonant peak position of the total optical coefficients . Under the effect of increasing external electric and magnetic fields the peak energy positions are shifted towards higher values whereas their amplitude decrease for the optical absorption case and that of the refractive index relative variation is reduced . From these results it can be concluded that both the modification of the confinement profile and the presence of electric and or magnetic fields are suitable tool to control the optical response of asymmetric hyperbolic type semiconductor quantum wells .
1056,We propose a novel analytical model for anisotropic multi layer cylindrical structures containing graphene layers .

1057,Plasmonic chemical and biological sensors have many advantages such as compact sizes and extremely high sensitivity . Biosensors based on plasmonic waveguides and resonators are one of the most attractive candidates for mobile and portable devices . In this work we proposed a metal insulator metal waveguide semi ring resonator loaded with nanodots periodically decorated in the cavity . The spectral characteristics of the sensor designs are studied via the finite element method . For comparison purpose a standard semi ring resonator of equivalent geometric parameters is also studied . It has been shown that the sensitivity of the proposed sensor design can be significantly increased by decorating nanodots in the cavity which allows the sensitivity to reach a value of 1084.21nm RIU . With these excellent properties this chip scale MIM design is believed to be able to find potential applications in integrated photonic systems such as optical sensing and optical networking fields .

1059,In this paper a novel multifunctional four layer SPR structure is proposed which can not only measure the RI of external layer but can also realize accurate measurement of the applied electric fields by fixing the external layer . When the structure is used for measuring the RI of external analytes the metal and electro optic crystal layers were optimized by FDTD solutions software . The thickness of Ag layer is 50 nm and the optimum electro optic crystal is BaTiO
1060,Metasurfaces artificial micro and nano photonic structures can modify wavefront of electromagnetic waves to the desired form . Metalenses are the metasurfaces assuming the role of focusing light . The focusing performance of nested gallium doped zinc oxide nanoring arrangements functionalized by conformal Talbot effect is investigated for communication wavelength 1550 nm . The Talbot effect focusing performance of the 2D finite sized structures are computationally demonstrated in a systematically manner . The impact of geometrical parameters on the primary focal spot and focusing performance parameters such as numerical aperture full width half maximum focal depth efficiency and fill factor is examined and summarized via finite difference time domain numerical simulations . All samples presenting an alternative plasmonic option in this work yield a good focusing efficiency of 50 absolute efficiency of 19 numerical aperture up to 0.67 focal depth up to 1.4 times of focal length and a wide focal spot size up to 6.0654 times of operating wavelength . As a result of finite sized construction conformal Talbot effect is examined from a novel alternative plasmonics perspective . Thus a new planarized focusing platform is employed by using a nanostructured microlens acting conformal transformation optics devices with low cost and light capturing tolerance .
1061,Plasmonics have allowed revolutionary progress in field of random lasers through improvement of the lasing property via surface plasmon resonance . However localized surface plasmon resonance spectra of conventional metal nanostructures are too narrow to sufficiently cover both the absorption and emission spectra of dyes . Therefore in this paper we fabricate a typical Ag TiO
1062,Nonlinear metasurfaces that dynamically manipulate the phase of a passing light beam are of interest for a wide range of applications . The controlled operation of such devices requires accurate measurements of the optical transmission phase in both the linear and nonlinear regime an experimentally challenging task . In this paper we show that this phase information can be extracted directly from simple transmission measurements using a Hilbert transform approach removing the need for complicated interferometric experimental set ups and enabling direct measurements of the phase in conditions not suitable for other traditional approaches such as Z scan measurements .
1063,We perform a theoretical study of light propagation properties in two dimensional square photonic crystals following Bravais Moir patterns paying particular attention to the influence of the transversal shape and the orientation of the dielectric scatters onto the width and position of photonic band gaps . In this sense we have considered both square and triangular transversal geometries for the dielectric scatters together with the possible rotation of either all the elements or of one half of them within the unit cell . Results for the photonic dispersion relations and band gaps are compared with those arising from the analysis of structures with simple bi atomic Bravais unit cells . It comes out that wider photonic gaps appear when using square shaped scatters . The use of Bravais Moir cells with the same kind of cores enhance the width of these gaps but shift them towards higher frequencies . Rotation of all elements within the cell in angles of 0.23rad and 0.46rad causes very small if not null changes in the photonic gap widths . However the rotation of one half of the scatters in the cell leaving the other half unrotated does produce noticeable modifications in the photonic band structure For crystals made of square shaped dielectric cores and simple cubic cells this rotation strongly modifies the photonic structure whilst for Bravais Moir crystals the same kind of change takes place for cells made of triangular shaped cores .
1064,In this work we introduce a four green light wavelength splitter device based on six slot waveguide structures . Silica and gallium nitride materials were chosen for confining the green light inside the slot waveguide area in a transverse magnetic field mode . The device functioned as a 1 4 demultiplexer which demultiplexes wavelengths in the green light band with wavelength range of 500530 nm with an accurate spacing of 10 nm . The coupling between the six slot waveguide units was analyzed using the classical mode theory and the full vectorial beam propagation method . Simulation results showed that the four wavelengths could be demultiplexed after a short coupling length of 106.5 m with low losses around 0.1080.127 dB full width at half maximum around 8.999.39 nm and excellent crosstalk around 21.13 to 24.1 dB . The device has the potential to increase data bitrate by utilizing the wavelength division multiplexing technique in visible light communication systems .
1065,A plasmonic refractive index sensor based on a metal insulator metal waveguide coupled with a double concentric square ring resonator is proposed and analyzed both theoretically and numerically . The theoretical and the numerical results are based on the transmission line model and the finite difference time domain method respectively . The theoretical results agree well with the numerical ones . A maximum sensitivity of 1250 nm per refractive index unit with a high figure of merit of 32.8 for the double concentric square ring resonator with one stub is obtained in the near infrared region . Also the double concentric square ring resonator with three stubs is simulated and has a maximum sensitivity of 1270 nm per refractive index unit with a high figure of merit of 58 . Our proposed plasmonic structures could find useful applications in sensing systems and integrated circuits in the near infrared region .
1066,An ultra compact all optical half adder operating at 1550 nm on silicon on insulator is realized by a modular inverse design method which deconstruct the design of optical units with complicated functions to several devices with basic functions . The half adder is composed of five modules two beam splitters one hub one XOR gate and one AND gate all of which are designed by the same multi objective particle swarm optimized method and have the equal area of 2 m 2 m. The system is studied numerically by the Finite Difference Time Domain method . Remarkable contrast ratios of 12.0 dB and 8.45 dB are obtained for AND gate and XOR gate respectively . The whole half adder possesses an ultra small area smaller than 10 m 5 m which results in a short respond time less than 0.7 ps and high respond speed beyond 1.4 THz . The contrast ratio between two output logic states 1 and 0 is around 7 dB and 15 dB for SUM and CARRY respectively . The half adder designed by modular inverse design method possess advantages such as tiny size fast respond and high diversity which indicates that our method has great potential as a universal method for the design of complicated integrated devices .

1068,We investigate the impact of financial crises on the syndicated loan spreads applied to public and private firms . We found evidence of a greater increase in loan spreads for European public firms than for private ones during the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis . This result is consistent with our hypothesis that public firms borrowing costs are more sensitive to financial market swings than those of private companies . Our results hold when we control for relationship banking effects a different sample composition between crisis and non crisis periods estimating a propensity score matching and adopting a sample of syndicated loans to US public firms .
1069,We study how information disclosure affects financial intermediation when the payoff to the long term investment is risky . The analysis is based on a business cycle version of the bank run model wherein a bank provides risk sharing to demand depositors who experience unobservable shocks to their liquidity preferences . The bank pre commits to the precision of an interim signal regarding the payoff to the long term investment . We examine the impact of bank disclosure on optimal risk sharing achieved by run proof signal contingent demand deposit contracts . We show that for utility functions that display non increasing absolute risk aversion more informative disclosure improves the ex ante risk sharing provided by financial intermediation .
1070,This study investigates whether deposit insurance affects bank payout policy . To overcome identification concerns we use the US Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which increased the maximum limit of deposit insurance coverage leading to significant changes in the proportion of insured deposits to assets of some banks while leaving others relatively unaffected . In line with the view that dividends convey information regarding financial health we find that banks which experience a substantial increase in insured deposits reduce dividends relative to others with a smaller increase in insured deposits . An extensive battery of further tests confirm that our results are not driven by events that took place around the time of the increase in the maximum limit of deposit insurance coverage . Overall the results of our empirical analysis suggest that banks holding fewer uninsured deposits pay less dividends .
1071,We consider predicting systemic financial crises one to five years ahead using recurrent neural networks . We evaluate the prediction performance with the Jrda Schularick Taylor dataset which includes the crisis dates and annual macroeconomic series of 17 countries over the period 18702016 . Previous literature has found that simple neural net architectures are useful and outperform the traditional logistic regression model in predicting systemic financial crises . We show that such predictions can be significantly improved by making use of the Long Short Term Memory and the Gated Recurrent Unit neural nets . Behind the success is the recurrent networks ability to make more robust predictions from the time series data . The results remain robust after extensive sensitivity analysis .
1072,We explore the effects of bank bailouts on competition in the underwriting business . We exploit a sample of underwriters active in the European corporate bond markets from 2006 to 2013 and find that reputable underwriters suffer market share losses after being bailed out . However the market share of non reputable underwriters is found to increase after a bail out . An exploration of the firmbank underwriting matching reveals that the probability of being chosen as underwriter in a given deal decreases for reputable bailed out banks while it increases for non reputable bailed out banks . These results provide evidence of the effects of bailouts on underwriting competition . The economic impact depends on the
1073,Using a sample of banks from 36 countries we document that accounting enforcement is negatively related to bank risk taking . We also provide evidence that accounting enforcement enhances bank stability during the crisis . In addition we show that banks assume less risk through more conservative lending decisions and a reduction in complexity in jurisdictions with higher accounting enforcement . Our results show that formal institutions such as accounting enforcement are associated with bank financial decisions and risk taking behavior .
1074,We analyse minute level multi dimensional information flows within and between bitcoin spot and derivatives . We show that perpetual swaps and futures traded on the unregulated exchanges Huobi OKEx and BitMEX are much the strongest instruments for bitcoin price discovery and we examine potential determinants of their leadership strength . Prices on the regulated CME bitcoin futures and the US based spot exchanges react to rather than lead price movements on the unregulated exchanges and they may do so relatively slowly . In a multi dimensional setting including the main price leaders within futures perpetuals and spot markets the CME futures have a very minor effect on price discovery even less than the spot exchanges Bitfinex Bitstamp and Coinbase . Our findings highlight the persistent problems stemming from inconsistent regulation in bitcoin spot and derivatives markets including insufficient price stability and lack of resistance to manipulative trading . We conclude that the SEC are correct to maintain such issues as their main concern for bitcoin ETF applications .
1075,The propagation of transverse Electromagnetic waves along a high energy relativistic electron beam passing through a neutralizing heavy ion background is investigated in the presence of an external axial magnetic field . By making use of the linearized fluid equations coupled with Maxwells equations the dielectric tensor and the dispersion relation of excited modes are derived . Since the electron motion is considered relativistic and fluid theory of plasma is used to describe the system the obtained results are applicable to a vast range of high energy density regime . The mutual interaction between EM and Electron Plasma Waves is studied numerically . In the absence of the axial magnetic field the EPWs and the Extraordinary Electromagnetic waves interact due to the existence of the self generated magnetic field . The instability caused by this interaction has already been reported . We found that applying an axial magnetic field will cause deflection to plasma oscillations which enables coupling between EPWs and Ordinary Electromagnetic waves as well . The results show that increasing the external magnetic field strength suppresses the growth rate caused by the coupling of EPWs EOEM and passes it to the growth of EPWs OEM . Therefore by adjusting the external magnetic field strength the growth of EOEM and OEM modes can be controlled .
1076,Herein a two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation has been performed to understand the MHD and the generated magnetic field behaviors of a capacitor coil target . The results showed that a peak B field strength was generated in the capacitor coil target followed by a current peak . This B field depends on a peak current with a pulse duration of 2ns . For a peak current of 2ns the average B field in the capacitor coil target is estimated by the center of the B field from the conventional circular current . The time difference between the peak current and the generated B field is up to 2ns . Furthermore the time difference of the capacitor coil target corresponds to the inductance and resistance of the capacitor coil target . Overall the results suggests that a longer laser pulse will improve the strength of B field generated by the capacitor coil target .
1077,Low mode asymmetries represent an important obstacle to achieving high gain inertial confinement fusion implosions . As a step in learning how to control such effects an OMEGA experiment with imposed mode 2 laser drive asymmetries was done to study the expected signatures of this type of asymmetry . In the present work a 3D xRAGE simulation including the stalk mount has been brought to bear on the data from that experiment . Comprehensive comparisons between simulated and measured observables are made . Good agreement between simulated and measured x ray image inferred shell trajectories bang times and neutron emission widths are seen showing that the hydrodynamics are well captured in the simulation . Asymmetries seen in simulated and measured time resolved and time integrated x ray images and areal densities also compare well showing impact of both stalk and mode 2 . On the other hand important differences in measured and simulated neutron emission histories yield and ion temperature
1078,To realize a pulsed power discharge plasma using a liquid metal we investigated the dependence of the diameter on the flow velocity of a liquid metal flow consisting of a U alloy . The plasma temperature was measured using a pyrometric method . The results show that the flow velocity estimated by the parabolic corresponds to a theoretical value derived from the difference between the gas pressure and atmospheric pressure . The diameter of the liquid metal flow was found to be 0.5 to 0.9 times smaller than the nozzle diameter . We have also demonstrated pulsed power discharge using this liquid metal load by observing optical emission from plasma . The results indicated that a low temperature plasma was generated by the proposed method .

1080,We investigated radiation damages induced by irradiating ions in a particle accelerator for a heavy ion inertial fusion system because the radio activation is an unavoidable issue to realize the future HIF power plant . In this study we estimated the radio activation at each part of the HIF accelerator . An evaluation using collisions due to Coulomb barrier gives the safer estimation in the radio activation of the vacuum vessel wall . The estimation results of total cross sections of nuclear reactions between an incident ion and wall elements showed the potential radio activation parts in the HIF accelerator . We indicated that schematic layouts of two types of HIF accelerators with the nuclear reaction cross section and the activated area for the HIF accelerator was evaluated .
1081,A combination of CR 39 track detectors and a stepwise energy filter is a simple method to measure the energy spectrum of laser accelerated protons . The number of etch pits in each area of the CR 39 detector is expected to represent the energy spectrum because the different thicknesses of the filters result in different areas into which the energy reaches in CR 39 . However the higher energy regions may overlap depending on the sensitivity of CR 39 . To avoid overlapping i.e . overestimation of the number of etch pits for each energy region a correction method for the energy spectrum from the number of etch pits was developed . Based on the calculation results of the reaching energy values and incident energy ranges for CR 39 etch pits are selected that should be counted in each area . CR 39 with stepwise energy filters provides a corrected energy spectrum of laser accelerated protons by applying the developed method .
1082,We evaluated the reconstruction quality from a conventional compressed ultrafast photography system and demonstrated a multi directional high speed imaging system based on the CUP system . We evaluated the defect rate as a function of the reconstruction quality . The results showed that the dependence of the defect rate on the reconstruction quality is similar to that from numerical experiments used to evaluate the mean square error . The results indicate that the shapes of two images could be reconstructed from one swept image .
1083,Introduction With the influx of Generation Z students into pharmacy schools there are new opportunities for pharmacy educators to develop its greatest asset . Assessing student characteristics is vital in creating pedagogical approaches in education .
1084,Increasing diagnosis of cancer when the disease is still at early stages is a priority of cancer policy internationally . In England reducing geographical inequalities in early diagnosis is also a key objective . Stage at diagnosis is not recorded for many patients which may bias assessments of progress . We evaluate temporal and geographical changes in stage at diagnosis during 20082013 for colorectal non small cell lung and ovarian cancers using multiple imputation to minimise bias from missing data . Population based data from cancer registrations routes to diagnosis secondary care and clinical audits were individually linked . Patient characteristics and recorded stage were summarised . Stage was imputed where missing using auxiliary information . Logistic regression was used to estimate temporal and geographical changes in early diagnosis adjusted for case mix using a multilevel model . We analysed 196 511 colorectal 180 048 non small cell lung and 29 076 ovarian cancer patients . We estimate that there were very large increases in the percentage of patients diagnosed at stages I or II between 2008 09 and 2012 13 from 32 to 44 for colorectal cancer 19 to 25 for non small cell lung cancer and 28 to 31 for ovarian cancer . Geographical inequalities reduced for colorectal and ovarian cancer . Multiple imputation is an optimal approach to reduce bias from missing data but residual bias may be present in these estimates . Increases in early stage diagnosis coincided with increased diagnosis through the two week wait pathway and colorectal screening . Epidemiological analyses from 2013 are needed to evaluate continued progress .
1085,Selection bias due to non or incomplete compliance is challenging in surveys . Using data from a longitudinal survey in testicular cancer survivors we identify factors predicting incomplete compliance . In a questionnaire based national survey 1 813 5year TCSs were invited to report post treatment adverse health outcomes . We separated complete from partial participants completed the first waves questionnaire and 783 became complete and 653 partial participants . Poor socio economics unhealthy life style major co morbidity and chemotherapy related AHOs reported at the first survey wave were associated with a significant 1.51.9 times increased risk for partial participation . At the two last waves non responders had significantly decreased overall survival compared with responders . Our longitudinal study indicates positive selection bias during the 17 years of a longitudinal survey among TCSs with fewer AHOs among Complete than among Partial Participants . If not sufficiently compensated for by data from external sources and or statistical methods attrition bias in longitudinal surveys may limit the external validity of findings related to cancer survivors self reported AHOs .
1086,Age standardization is vital in international comparison studies of cancer patient survival but standard approaches can fail to produce estimates in the case of sparsity . The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that using a standardization pre weighting approach is a viable alternative approach for external age standardization in population based cancer data and performs well in cases of sparsity . We further de 1 scribe how the pre weighting approach to age standardization can be coupled with the Pohar Perme estimator in both a cohort and period analysis setting . For period analysis we compare approaches for defining the internal age distribution . We use SEER public use data to illustrate our approach and estimate survival for Connecticut and by race to create a scenario with sufficient sparsity . The pre weighting approach gives comparable estimates to traditional age standardization in cases with sufficient data and produces estimates throughout follow up in cases of sparsity when a traditional approach would fail . International comparison studies and other national population based survival studies that need to age standardize estimates for comparability purposes should adopt the Pohar Perme estimator with pre weighting . This approach avoids issues of non estimation in the case of sparsity and will allow more consistent comparisons across the produced estimates .
1087,To estimate a possible association between coffee intake during pregnancy and risk of childhood acute leukemia by using a cohort design . We included data from two birth cohorts the Danish National Birth Cohort and the Aarhus Birth Cohort . Recruitment of 141 216 eligible pregnancies occurred from 1 August 1989 to 31 December 2012 . Information on maternal prenatal coffee intake and covariates was collected in early second trimester of pregnancy . Information on childhood AL diagnosed in offspring was obtained from the Danish National Patient Register . We used competing risk time to event regression analysis using the pseudo observation method to estimate risk ratio with no coffee intake during pregnancy considered the reference group . In total 96 children were diagnosed with AL hereof 73 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Coffee intake of 0.53 cups day during pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk of childhood AL aRR 0.89 95 confidence interval 0.48 1.65 however an intake of 3 cups day resulted in aRR 1.37 95 CI 0.56 3.32 . Only including ALL as outcome we found similar results aRR 0.80 95 CI 0.371.74 and aRR 1.46 95 CI 0.524.09 respectively . We found no significant association between maternal coffee intake and risk of childhood AL but the number of cases was limited . The confidence limits does not exclude that a high prenatal coffee intake may increase the risk of childhood AL and larger studies based on prospective data are needed .
1088,Human leukocyte antigens are encoded by closely linked genetic loci and are important in cervical carcinogenesis . The association between HLA DRB1 alleles with cervical cancer has been studied extensively but results reported thus far have been inconsistent . Hence we performed a meta analysis to precisely assess this association . A literature search was conducted in various online databases to identify suitable articles . Case control studies investigating the association between HLA DRB1 alleles and cervical cancer were included in this study . Fixed and random effect models were used to calculate the pooled odds ratio and 95 confidence intervals . A total of 6645 cases and 9095 controls from 36 case control studies were included . Of the 13 HLA DRB1 family alleles DRB1 09 and DRB1 15 were associated with cervical cancer risk whilst DRB1 13 exerted a protective effect . Among the 44 HLA DRB1 specific alleles DRB1 04 01 DRB1 10 01 DRB1 11 01 DRB1 15 01 and DRB1 15 02 were associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer . However DRB1 04 06 DRB1 12 02 DRB1 13 01 DRB1 13 02 and DRB1 14 04 were associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer . Subgroup analysis also revealed that HLA DRB1 alleles are associated with cervical cancer in Asian Caucasian Hispanic or Latin American and black sub Saharan Africa populations . Our meta analysis revealed that multiple HLA DRB1 alleles are associated with cervical cancer in women of diverse ancestry populations .
1089,The objectives of this study were to characterize the epidemiology of liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis characterize the incidence trends of synchronous liver metastases from 20102015 and assess survival of patients with synchronous liver metastases . The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database from 2010 to 2015 was queried to obtain cases of patients with liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis . The primary cancers with an incidence rate of liver metastasis 0.1 are presented in this analysis . Among 2.4 million cancer patients 5.14 of cancer patients presented with synchronous liver metastases . The most common primary site was breast cancers for younger women and colorectal cancers for younger men . As patients get older a more heterogenous population of the top cancers with liver metastases emerges including esophageal stomach small intestine melanoma and bladder cancer in addition to the large proportion of lung pancreatic and colorectal cancers . The 1 year survival of all patients with liver metastases was 15.1 compared to 24.0 in those with non hepatic metastases . Regression analysis showed that the presence of liver metastasis was associated with reduced survival particularly in patients with cancers of the testis prostate breast and anus and in those with melanoma . The most common primary sites for patients with liver metastases varied based on age at diagnosis . Survival for patients with liver metastasis was significantly decreased as compared to patients without liver metastasis .
1090,Unhealthy food environments may be associated with higher risks of developing diet related cancers such as colorectal cancer . We conducted an ecological analysis to evaluate the relationship between the local food environment and colorectal cancer incidence overall and separately for males and females . Data from the Texas Cancer Registry was utilized to geocode individuals aged 40 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer from 2005 to 2015 to their residential 2010 census tract . Total number of establishments classified as Limited Service Restaurants for each census tract was retrieved from the 2005 Business Patterns Survey by using a crosswalk to map zip codes to census tract . Census tract unhealthy food availability was calculated by dividing the estimated number of Limited Service Restaurant establishments in each census tract by the census tract population and divided into quartiles . Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the association between unhealthy food availability quartiles and colorectal cancer incidence . Adjusting for the census tract level sociodemographic characteristics the incidence of colorectal cancer was slightly higher in unhealthy food availability quartile 2 1.03 95 CI 1.001.05 but not quartile 3 and quartile 4 compared to census tracts with lowest unhealthy food availability . Colorectal cancer incidence was not strongly associated with census tracts with higher unhealthy food availability . Future observational studies should be conducted to examine the influence of the built environment on colorectal cancer risk .
1091,The burden of renal cell carcinoma in young adults received marginal attention . We assessed contemporary gender race and stage specific incidence and trends of RCC among young adults in the United States . Within Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database patients aged 2039 years with histologically confirmed RCC were included . Age standardized incidence rates were estimated . Temporal trends were calculated through joinpoint regression analyses to describe the average annual percent change . From 20002016 7767 new RCC cases were recorded . ASRs were higher in males than in females and increased significantly in both genders . Non Hispanic American Indian Alaska Native had the highest incidence vs. non Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander the lowest . ASRs significantly increased in all ethnic groups . T1aN0M0 and T1bN0M0 stages showed the highest incidence and increase . Also regional and distant stages increased . The most frequent tumor characteristics were G2 and G1 as well as clear cell histology . RCC in young adults is rare but increasing . This is mainly due to T1aN0M0 tumors . Nonetheless also regional diseases are significantly increasing . Differences between ethnic groups exist and may warrant further research .
1092,Early diagnosis and stage at presentation two prognostic factors for survival among patients with head and neck cancer are significantly impacted by a patients health insurance status . We aimed to assess the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on stage at presentation across socioeconomic and demographic subpopulations of HNC patients in the United States . Retrospective data analysis . The National Cancer Database a hospital based cancer database was queried for adults aged 1864 years and diagnosed with a malignant primary HNC . The outcome of interest was change in early stage diagnoses between 20112013 and 20142015 using logistic regression models . A total of 91 137 HNC cases were identified in the pre ACA and post ACA years . Overall the odds of early stage diagnoses did not change significantly post ACA aOR 0.97 95 CI 0.94 1.00 We demonstrate a significant association between ACA implementation and increased early stage presentation among Medicaid enrolled HNC patients . This suggests that coverage expansions through the ACA may be associated with increased access to care and may yield greater benefits among low income HNC patients .
1093,Introduction . The incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia varies between countries likely as a result of competing risks including infections access to care socioeconomic influences and or ethnicity . However little is known about disease burden in high income Arab countries offering free of charge healthcare . The hypothesis was that due to population characteristics the incidence of cALL in Saudi Arabia is equal or higher than that observed in high income Western countries .
1094,With considerable diversity in the patterns of cancer in different regions of Thailand and between urban vs. rural areas this report focuses on cancer incidence burden in the Bangkok Metropolis 201115 . Incidence rates in Bangkok were derived as the mean annual number of new cancer cases per 100 000 inhabitants for the period 20112015 stratified by 5 year age group and sex . Age standardized incidence rates were calculated using the world standard population . The five most frequent cancers in Bangkok correspond to close to 60 of the total burden in both males and females . In males cancers of the lung liver and colorectum each comprised 1416 of the burden while breast cancer was responsible for three in 10 cancers in women with colorectal and cervical cancer ranking second and third . respectively . Under three different scenarios of trends in all cancer incidence rates demographic changes mean that the incidence burden will rise over the next two decades . The critical relevance of this information in the context of the planning and evaluation of national cancer control policies in Thailand is discussed . Evidently the Bangkok and other Thai population based cancer registries are essential in measuring the population level impact of tobacco control HBV and HPV vaccination cervical and colorectal cancer screening and via survival estimation the effectiveness of cancer care .
1095,Infection is hypothesised as a contributory cause of childhood immune cell malignancies . Although some have reported associations between individual infections and immune cell malignancies some could be spurious due to infections caused by malignancies that were already active prior to diagnosis . Identified from Taiwan Cancer Registry 3000 children with four commonest immune cell malignancies diagnosed during 20012015 at age 120 years were identified and matched with 1 10 controls . Using logistic regression we estimated the time specific case versus control odds ratios of seven common infection presentations in their health records . We also compared recorded unexplained lymph nodes between cases and controls to explore for how long malignancy may be active prior to diagnosis . Unexplained lymph nodes were increasingly recorded months before the diagnosis of childhood leukaemias and years before the diagnosis of childhood lymphomas . When using p 0.01 as a guide large case control differences in infection records were found mostly within 02 months prior to the diagnosis . Changes in odds ratios within 335 months and case control differences beyond 36 months prior to diagnosis was relatively small . Statistical power varied according to incidence of malignancy incidence of infection records and the age distribution . Immune cell malignancies were likely to be active some time before the diagnosis . Previous studies using conventional population based methods may not be able to distinguish any small causal link between infection and immune cell malignancies from spurious associations .
1096,To monitor trends in childhood cancer mortality in Europe . We calculated age standardized mortality rates per 100 000 children from 1990 to the last available calendar year for all neoplasms and six main cancers in childhood in selected European countries and geographic areas plus the European Union using data from the World Health Organization database . We carried out a joinpoint regression analysis of mortality trends for all neoplasms leukaemia and tumours of the nervous system . Results of the joinpoint regression were summarized through annual percent change for each identified linear segment and weighted average APC over the whole period . From 1990 to 2015 childhood total cancer mortality rates dropped by 2.8 per year in the EU to reach 2.6 100 000 in the latest available calendar years . The greatest declines were in central eastern countries . Recent rates ranged between 1.7 and 4.3 deaths 100 000 with the highest values in central eastern Europe . Leukaemia mortality rates in the EU decreased from 1.6 to 0.6 100 000 in the latest calendar years . The deepest declines were registered in central eastern countries though they still showed the highest rates . The lowest leukaemia mortality rates were in northern western Europe but also in the Czech Republic and Poland . Southern European countries showed comparatively high rates . Nervous system tumours showed relatively modest falls . Childhood cancer mortality continued to decline steady in Europe though geographic differences persist . Further efforts are required to fill the gap by promoting widespread and rational adoption of currently available treatment protocols .
1097,Little is known about the etiology of childhood Wilms tumor and potentially modifiable maternal risk factors in particular . Unpublished data derived from the hospital based case control study of the Greek Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies and Solid Tumors were included in an Effect estimates from 72 cases and 72 age and sex matched controls contributed by NARECHEM ST were meta analysed together with those of another 17 mainly medium size studies of ecological case control and cohort design . Maternal intake of folic acid and or other vitamins supplements during pregnancy was inversely associated with WT risk 6 studies OR 0.78 95 CI 0.690.89 I In the largest to date meta analysis there was an inverse association of maternal folic acid or vitamins supplementation with WT risk in the offspring derived mainly from ecological studies . The association with maternal alcohol consumption found in our study needs to be further explored whereas no association with maternal smoking was detected . Given the proven benefits for other health conditions recommendations regarding folic acid supplementation as well as smoking and alcohol cessation should apply . The maternal alcohol consumption associations however should be further explored given the inherent limitations in the assessment of exposures of the published studies .
1098,This study was aimed to analyze the spectrum of time intervals from the onset of symptoms to the commencement of treatment in esophagogastric cancers . Factors influencing these time delays and correlation between these time points with variables including socioeconomic strata educational level histopathology location of tumor and the initial modality of treatment were assessed . A prospective analysis of patients with esophagogastric cancer presenting to a single tertiary care unit over a period of 12 months was performed . Histopathology other than adenocarcinoma and squamous cell were excluded . 202 patients were enrolled in the study . Most patients presented with advanced disease i.e . 91.5 of esophageal and 90 of gastric malignancies belonged to either stage 3 or stage 4 as per American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor node metastasis staging system . The median delay from the appearance of the first symptoms to initiation of treatment was 15 weeks . Patient related factors contributed to a significant delay . Administrative factors were responsible for median delay of 3 weeks . Curative multimodality treatment was administered in 62.5 of patients . Significant longer delay was influenced by socioeconomic strata educational level evaluation by non specialist . No relationship was noted between histopathology location of tumor or initial modality of treatment . Delays in our setting is much more than that is seen in Western and even some Asian countries . An important component of delay is administrative related factors . These may be intervened at the hospital level compared to other factors which may need long term community oriented approaches .
1099,There are reports that lung cancer in non smokers is increasing in the United Kingdom and other high income countries but evidence from large scale cohort studies to support this claim is limited . Using The Health Improvement Network IQVIA Medical Research Data we identified a cohort of 3 679 831 people from the UK self reporting to their primary care physician as never or non smokers . We estimated age adjusted incidence rates for recorded lung cancer before and after the introduction of smoke free legislation using multivariable Poisson regression . We also explored the impact of geographic location social deprivation and urbanicity . The analysis included 3 212 lung cancer events and 28 million person years . Between 1998 and 2007 the age adjusted rates in men declined by 9 per year from an estimated 5.6 to 1.5 per 10 000 PYs and by 3 per year between 2008 and 2018 . These trends for men were similar across sociodemographic strata . Between 1998 and 2007 age adjusted rates were stable for women at 1.5 per 10 000 PYs . However there was evidence that time trends for women differed depending on levels of social deprivation with rates increasing by 5 per year from an estimated 1.32.1 per 10 000 PYs for women living in the least socially deprived areas . Sex specific time trends from 2008 to 2016 were broadly similar in a separate cohort of self reported never smokers from UK Biobank with cancer events linked to national registries . In summary the incidence of LCINS has reduced or remained stable for most of the UK with the possible exception of women living in the least socially deprived areas .
1100,To describe cancer incidence and treatment utilization patterns at the regional cancer referral center for the Lake Zone of northwestern Tanzania from 2008 to 2016 . This descriptive retrospective study reviewed all cancer cases recorded in the Bugando Cancer Registry a clinical and pathology based registry at the only cancer referral hospital in the region . Primary tumor site method of diagnosis HIV status and cancer treatment were reported . Using census data the 2012 GLOBOCAN estimates for Tanzania were scaled to the Lake Zone and adjusted for 2016 population growth . These estimates were then compared to BCR cases using one sample tests of proportion . A total of 2772 cases were reported from 20082016 . Among these the majority of cases were diagnosed among adults . Most cases were diagnosed by histology or cytology . Among adults the most common cancers diagnosed were cervix breast and prostate . Among children the most common cancers were non Burkitt non Hodgkin lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma and Wilms tumor . The 1116 BCR cases represent 12.2 of the 9165 expected number of cancer cases for the Lake Zone . 1494 cases received some form of treatment surgery chemotherapy radiation or hormone therapy while 1278 cases had no treatment recorded . This comprehensive report of the BCR reveals cancer epidemiology and treatment utilization patterns typical of hospitals in low resource settings . Despite being the only cancer center in the Lake Zone BMC evaluates a small percentage of the expected number of cancer patients for the region . The BCR remains an important resource to guide clinical care and academic activities for the Lake Zone .
1101,With the prevalence of cancer survivors increasing their unique needs must be better understood . We examined the health lifestyles and social circumstances of adults with and without a history of cancer . We performed a cross sectional study using exposure and outcome data from the baseline survey of participants in the 45 and Up Study a prospective cohort study in New South Wales Australia . We compared 20 811 cancer registry verified adult cancer survivors with 207 148 participants without a history of cancer using propensity score weighting and accounting for multiple testing . The propensity weighting included age sociodemographic factors and number of self reported co morbidities . Cancer survivors were more likely to report poorer physical and psychological health and quality of life compared to those without a cancer history with most deficits still evident more than 10 years after cancer diagnosis . Cancer survivors were more likely to have a higher body mass index but were less likely to smoke . Cancer survivors had greater functional limitations including sexual and were less likely to work full time volunteer and spend time outdoors . Their social connectedness was however similar . Those with haematological cancer lung cancer or distant metastases and those diagnosed at an older age had the greatest health deficits and functional limitations . A history of cancer is associated with poorer health and less paid and unpaid work . Our findings reinforce the importance of routine long term integrated multidisciplinary care for cancer survivors and indicate the subgroups with the greatest unmet needs .
1102,Based the important role of patient reported outcome in measuring patients QoL a general PRO instrument was designed for Chinese patients with cancer . The instrument was administered in eight hospitals . Based on PRO guidelines a conceptual framework and item pool were generated after literature review and patients interviews . Via two item selection process the original version of a cancer PRO measure was generated . Patients responsiveness was evaluated in four disease systems by item response theory . The reliability validity and feasibility of CA PROM were assessed . The minimum clinically important differences and risk thresholds of PRO were calculated . A total of 2213 valid questionnaires were collected . After expert opinions and cognitive tests 11 items were deleted . In the pre survey and formal survey 19 items were deleted based on six methods of classical test theory . In the respiratory digestive hematological and endocrine systems four items with poor responsiveness were deleted by item response theory . The final CA PROM included four domains 13 subdomains and 49 items . Reliability coefficients of 13 subdomain was The developed CA PROM exhibited good reliability validity and feasibility and can be used as an effective evaluation tool in cancer patients .
1103,LongAn Guangxi was the first county in China to implement universal childhood hepatitis B virus immunization . We aimed to determine its long term effects in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma 32 years after the immunization programme was launched . Information on HCC deaths for LongAn and its neighbouring county BinYang were obtained from the national mortality surveillance system . The data were analysed using Poisson regression . The overall age adjusted mortalities of HCC in LongAn and BinYang during 20172018 were 53.3 100 000 and 45.4 100 000 respectively . The mortality of males aged 2029 years in LongAn who were vaccinated at birth was lower than that of males in BinYang who were not vaccinated . In LongAn the HCC mortality in adults aged 2029 years declined significantly from 7.9 100 000 in 2004 to 1.4 100 000 in 20172018 Immunization of infants against HBV has reduced their risk of developing HCC as children and young adults but could not prevent all cases of HCC suggesting that the major risk factor for HCC in hyperendemic regions is shifting from HBV to other factors . Additional prevention strategies for HCC will be needed in the future .
1104,Osteosarcoma is rare disease and there is a strong controversy about the potential impact of symptom interval on the stage of disease and patients outcomes . We want to assess whether increased symptom interval is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma . We analyzed prospectively collected data of 220 patients younger than 40 years who had osteosarcoma around the knee . Symptom interval was analyzed to evaluate its impact on metastases at diagnosis tumor volume chemotherapy response and overall survival . The median of SI was 64.5 days . The 5 year overall survival rate for patients with different length of symptom interval were 0.78 0.49 0.52 and 0.65 respectively Increased SI but not the longest SI is associated with higher incidence of metastases at diagnosis patients can benefit from an earlier diagnosis in terms of survival .
1105,Mitochondrial DNA copy number is considered a biomarker for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress . Although previous studies have suggested a potential relationship between mtDNAcn at the time of colorectal cancer diagnosis and CRC prognosis findings have been inconsistent and no study has specifically investigated the association of pre diagnostic mtDNAcn with CRC survival . We examined the association of pre diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn with overall and CRC specific survival among 587 patients in Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study . Cox models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals . During a mean follow up of 10.5 years 395 deaths were identified 180 were due to CRC . Overall we did not observe significant associations between mtDNAcn and either overall or CRC specific survival among all cases or by cancer location grade or stage . In an exploratory stratified analysis a suggestive inverse association of mtDNAcn and overall death risk appeared among current smokers for 1 SD decrease in mtDNAcn 1.50 no significant associations between pre diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn and either overall or CRC specific survival appeared but exploratory analysis identified potential sub group associations .
1106,The aim of the study was to characterize subsequent neoplasm benign and non melanoma skin cancer treated previously for a childhood solid malignant tumor at the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Motol University Hospital Prague . We evaluated a cohort of 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018 . From 4059 survivors 170 developed at least one SMN 193 SMNs in 170 survivors 21 of them had two or more SMNs and 34 of them had one SMN and one or more BSNs . Mortality for an SMN was 38.2 i.e . 1.6 of all survivors . The most frequent SMNs were thyroid carcinoma tumors of the central nervous system soft tissue sarcoma breast carcinoma and leukemia . Genetic syndromes were present in 25 patients with SMNs and in 16 patients with only BSNs . SMNs usually developed in second decade or later after finishing of therapy . We observed some not well known risk factors of SNs e.g . spinal irradiation or We confirmed data from previous studies of SNs and observed some not so well known risk factors . Our results and the literature show that the incidence of SMNs is 310 of survivors and is associated with high mortality .
1107,This study aimed to investigate the association between physical activity and site specific cancer incidence . UK Biobank is a prospective population based cohort study . 364 899 adults were included . The exposure variable was physical activity level derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form . Participants were categorised at high moderate or low levels of activity following standardised IPAQ SF scoring guidance . Primary outcome measures included incident cancers at 20 sites . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals showing relationships between physical activity and cancer . 21 816 incident cancers were identified . Significant associations were identified between high physical activity levels and lower risk of lung breast hepatobiliary tract and colon cancers compared to low physical activity levels . Moderate levels of physical activity were associated with significantly lower risk of oropharyngeal and lung cancer compared to low physical activity levels . Sensitivity analyses showed associations of higher physical activity with lower oesophageal and higher prostate cancer incidence . Regular physical activity is significantly associated with reduced risk for lung breast hepatobiliary tract colon and oropharyngeal cancers . Our findings highlight the importance of physical activity promotion particularly high levels of physical activity in cancer prevention .
1108,The main evidence regarding social inequalities in cancer risk comes from industrialized countries . The aim of this manuscript was to analyze the association between cancer incidence and socioeconomic position in a middle income country between 2011 and 2015 . An ecological study at the level of the electoral district was conducted . The 477 districts were divided by area and wealth using the 2011 Census . The sample was defined using the National Electoral Rolls used for presidential elections of 2006 and 2010 . 44 799 cancer cases were included coming from the Costa Rican Cancer Registry . Cox models were used . All cancer sites combined we observed a positive gradient with incidence being lower in the poorest districts than in the wealthiest HRQ3 0.92 HRQ4 0.83 . For colon skin breast prostate thyroid and other cancer sites a positive social gradient was observed . For stomach lung and cervical cancers a negative social gradient was found . For uterine cancer and lymphoma there was no significant relationship between wealth and incidence . For skin cancer incidence was higher in rural as compared to urban areas after adjustment for wealth . For lung cervical and uterine cancer incidence was lower in rural as compared to urban area after adjustment for wealth . The all cancer combined results were in contradiction with the international literature but confirmed recent study results in Costa Rica . It confirmed the importance of studying socioeconomic inequalities in middle income countries .
1109,Determining the validity of self reported data is important . The aim of this study was to assess the validity of self reported cancer and investigate factors associated with accurate reporting in men and women . Study participants from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study located in south eastern Australia were utilised . Self reported cancer data were compared to Victorian Cancer Registry records . Age socioeconomic status education and time between cancer diagnosis and study appointment were investigated as factors associated with accuracy of self report . There were 142 participants who self reported a cancer and 135 with a VCR record . Comparing self report to any registry record sensitivity was 63.7 specificity 96.5 PPV 60.6 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.588 . Comparing exact match records sensitivity was 58.8 specificity 95.5 PPV 49.3 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.499 . In logistic regression models post secondary education was independently associated with accuracy of any and exact match self report compared to cancer registry record . For any cancer being aged 70 years was inversely associated with accuracy . Likewise for matched cancer reporting those aged 6070 years and 70 years were less accurate . No other significant associations were detected . Results suggest moderate agreement between self report and registry data for any cancer among men and women . However when comparing self report to registry data for exact match cancer type level of overall agreement deteriorated . Self report cancer data may be acceptable for determining a history of cancer although is less accurate in identifying history of specific cancer types documented in registry based data .
1110,Peru has a public health problem because of asbestos imports . We analyzed the mortality trends for mesothelioma in Peru and its provinces from 2005 to 2014 and estimated their relationship with the amount of asbestos imported previously . We computed age standardized mortality rates per 100 000 population and the standardized mortality ratio . The relationship between the amount of asbestos imported annually along the period 19652010 and the number of mesothelioma deaths per year from 2005 to 2014 was estimated by log linear Poisson regression models and Pearson correlation calculations . After correcting the number of deaths Peru registered 428 cases between 2005 and 2014 . The highest ASMRs were in Arequipa and Callao followed by Huancavelica . This translates into approximately one death per each 68111 of asbestos tons imported . The latency period for the higher level of positive correlation found was 8 years . Male female sex ratio was lower in provinces such as Junin and Hunacavelica with geological asbestos risk . Two patterns of mesothelioma risk have been detected occupational and environmental . During the 20022006 years Peru increased the asbestos use . If crocidolite imports were also increased this could be behind the 8 years latency period detected . Peru should boost strategies towards the total ban of all forms of asbestos .
1111,Race is an important determinant of cancer outcome . The purpose of this study was to identify disparities in clinical presentation treatment use and in hospital outcomes of patients with spinal metastases . The United States National Inpatient Sample database was queried to identify patients with metastatic disease and cord compression or spinal pathological fracture . Clinical presentation type of intervention and in hospital outcomes were compared between races ethnicities . Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed and adjusted for differences in patient age sex insurance status income quartile hospital teaching status and size Charlson comorbidity index smoking status tumor type and neurological status . A total of 145 809 patients were identified 74.8 Caucasian 14.1 African American 7.9 Hispanic and 3.2 Asian . Over one third of patients presented with MSCC 35.7 of Caucasians 50.3 of AAs 41.1 of Hispanics and 39.8 of Asians . Paralysis affected 8.4 of all patients 7.4 of Caucasians 12.7 of AAs 10.5 of Hispanics and 10.0 of Asians . For patients with MSCC multivariate analysis showed that AAs were less likely to undergo surgical intervention significantly more likely to experience a complication significantly more likely to experience prolonged length of stay and significantly more likely to experience a non routine discharge compared to Caucasians . Minority groups with spinal metastatic disease may be at a disadvantage compared to Caucasians with significant disparities found in presenting characteristics type of intervention and in hospital outcomes . Continued efforts to overcome these differences are needed .
1112,Human papillomavirus is considered the strongest epidemiologic risk factor for cervical cancer . However it is not a sufficient cause given the high prevalence of transient infections . We examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco smoke measured using urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and p16 Ki 67 co expression in cervical smears and subsequent risk of developing CIN2 CIN3 lesions in HPV positive women . This prospective longitudinal study enrolled women presenting to colposcopy with cytological abnormalities LSIL ASCUS at the National Maternity Hospital Dublin . Women gave a urine sample which was used to perform the Nicotine Metabolite Assay . HPV positive cervical smears were stained by immunocytochemistry for p16 Ki 67 . Two year follow up data including histological diagnosis was collected for each woman . Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to investigate associations between tobacco smoke p16 Ki 67 positivity and CIN2 CIN3 . In total 275 HPV positive women were included . Women with nicotine metabolite concentrations above 500 ng mL indicative of smoking were classified as smokers . Smokers were at an increased risk of testing positive for p16 Ki 67 and CIN2 and CIN3 in compared to non smokers . In p16 Ki 67 positive women smoking further increased their risk of CIN2 CIN3 . HPV positive women exposed to tobacco smoke are at a higher risk of testing positive for p16 Ki 67 co expression . Risk of high grade disease is almost doubled in women who are exposed to tobacco smoke .
1113,Socioeconomic inequalities in colorectal cancer survival are a major concern of the Spanish public health system . If these inequalities were mainly due to differences in stage at diagnosis population based screening programs might reduce them substantially . We aimed to determine to what extent adverse stage distribution contributed to survival inequalities in a Spanish region before the implementation of a CRC screening program . We analyzed data from a population based cohort study that included all patients living in a region of southern Spain with CRC diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 . The European Deprivation Index was used to assign each patient a socioeconomic level based on their area of residence . The role of tumor stage in survival disparities between socioeconomic groups was assessed using a causal mediation analysis . A total of 2802 men and 1957 women were included in the study . For men the adjusted difference in deaths between the most deprived and the most affluent areas was 131 deaths per 1000 person years by the first year after diagnosis . Of these deaths 42 were attributable to differences in stage at diagnosis . No socioeconomic disparities in survival were detected among female patients . In this study we mainly detected socioeconomic disparities in short term survival of male patients . More than two thirds of these inequalities could not be attributed to differences in stage at diagnosis . Our results suggest that in addition to a screening program other public health interventions are necessary to reduce the deprivation gap in survival .
1114,To identify time trends in incidence mortality and 5 year relative survival in children and adolescents with cancer in Goiania Goias Brazil during the years of 19962012 . Incidence and mortality age standardized rates were calculated and trends were identified by determining the Average Annual Percentage Change . Five year relative survival were estimated . The overall incidence ASR was 164.2 1 000 000 in both genders . In boys was 176.6 1 000 000 in girls it was 151.8 1 000 000 . Overall mortality ASR for both gender were 69.3 1 000 000 . Incidence rates and mortality rates were stable in the period . Five year relative survival for all cancers were 63.9 with the highest survival rates for retinobastoma germ cell tumors and lymphomas . It was observed an increase in survival in the period from de 62.8 to 65.0 from 2004 to 2012 . Children and adolescent cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher in Goiania but both are stable overall . The relative survival slighly improved in the period but remained lower mainly for leukemias .
1115,Few studies have evaluated associations between birth defects and risk of pediatric cancers by age of attainment . Therefore we assessed the risk of cancer among children with and without birth defects by age at attainment . We examined cancer risk in children 14 years with and without birth defects born between 1996 and 2011 by linking data from the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System Arkansas Central Cancer Registry and birth certificates . Age of attainment for cancer was calculated as person years from birth to cancer diagnosis death or end of study period whichever occurred first . Using Cox proportional hazards models we evaluated associations by attained age groups between groups of birth defects and any cancer non chromosomal birth defects by organ system and any cancer and non chromosomal birth defects and subtypes of cancer . In the cohort of 629 086 children 23 341 children had birth defects and 1 037 children had cancer . For children with non chromosomal birth defects specifically cardiovascular and genitourinary highest risk of any cancer was observed in first year of life 18.5 95 confidence interval 10.1 33.8 . For children with chromosomal birth defects increased cancer risk was observed among those 1 4 years old . Overall cancer risk among children with birth defects was highest among those 5 years old . Our findings consistent with previous studies may inform surveillance strategies for children with birth defects .
1116,Few studies have assessed the relation between maternal prenatal pesticides use and childhood lymphoma risk some reporting a positive association with non Hodgkin lymphoma . We investigated the association between maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy and childhood Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphoma . We pooled data from the two French national population based case control studies ESCALE and ESTELLE . Data on domestic and occupational exposures to pesticides during pregnancy were obtained through standardised maternal interviews . Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals for HL and NHL by pesticide category adjusted for potential confounders . Analyses by histological subtypes were also performed . We included 328HL 305 non Hodgkin NHL and 2 415 controls . Around 40 of control mothers reported having used pesticides during index pregnancy of whom 95 reported insecticides use . Maternal use of herbicides and fungicides occurred mostly in combination with insecticides . Insecticides use was more frequently reported in cases than controls OR These results suggest that maternal domestic use of insecticides during pregnancy might be related to both childhood NHL and HL . Further larger studies are urgently needed .
1117,Multimorbidity is associated with a high mortality rate and low health related quality of life . Previous studies have indicated that multimorbidity tends to be associated with not receiving cancer screening although this association remains unclear . This study aimed to investigate the associations between multimorbidity and the delivery of breast cervical and colorectal cancer screening in Japan and to identify subgroups that did not receive cancer screening . This study used cross sectional data from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions which used a stratified random sample of the general Japanese population . Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between the number of chronic conditions and each cancers screening proportion . The relevant covariates included age marital status education level occupation and household income . Relative to subjects with no chronic conditions subjects with two chronic conditions received more screening for breast cervical and colorectal cancers 5.42 95 confidence interval 2.8010.5 cervical cancer aOR 4.59 95 CI 2.0310.4 male colorectal cancer aOR 3.26 95 CI 1.298.24 female colorectal cancer aOR 1.05 95 CI 0.392.81 . Low socioeconomic status was associated with not receiving any type of cancer screening consistently . Multimorbidity and high socioeconomic status were associated with higher proportions of screening for breast cervical and colorectal cancers in the Japanese population . More aggressive strategies may be needed to promote screening among Japanese individuals with no chronic conditions and individuals with low socioeconomic status .
1118,Patients with disorders differences of sex development especially those possessing the Y chromosome have a higher risk of gonadal germ cell tumours . We aimed to examine the incidence of different types of gonadal neoplasia and associated risk factors . A total of 1040 DSD patients aged 16 years participated in a cross sectional multicentre European study . Data on medical history were gathered from the patients archival medical documents . A web based questionnaire was filled out individually by the participants . A physical examination was performed in all while ultrasonography of gonads was carried out in 214 and semen analysis was performed for 53 patients . Germ cell neoplasia was present in 12 of patients with DSD and in 14 of those with XY DSD . The highest risk was observed in 46 XY patients with gonadal dysgenesis complete GD and partial GD but also in mixed GD and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome . It was not reported in partial AIS XX male 46 XX DSD and congenital adrenal hyperplasia Turner and Klinefelter syndromes or in androgen biosynthesis defects . Benign sex cord stromal tumours were noted only in patients with complete AIS and Klinefelter syndrome . A relationship between risk factors for GCT and gonadal neoplasia appearance other than the Y chromosome was not found . Adult patients with GD and the Y chromosome have the highest risk of GCT and should be kept under thorough medical control and receive special medical follow up to prevent the development of gonadal tumours .
1119,To evaluate the performance of low dose computed tomography on lung cancer screening in high risk populations in Sichuan . From April 2014 to July 2018 LDCT was performed annually on 3185 subjects aged 5074 years who had smoked 20 pack years . Information about all deaths and lung cancer diagnoses were obtained by active investigation or passive matching to disease surveillance system . The screening population had a median age of 60 years . 62.4 of which were current smokers and had smoked 30 pack years . After participating in the baseline screening the compliance rates of subjects consecutively completing one round two rounds three rounds and four rounds of annual screening were 67.22 52.84 43.24 and 40.04 respectively . The positive rates in baseline and annual screening were 6.53 and 5.79 respectively . During the 5 rounds a total of 9522 person times were screened by LDCT with a screening sensitivity of 89.13 95 The application of LDCT on lung cancer screening in high risk populations shows favorable compliance and a high screening performance in the project area of Sichuan China .
1120,This study quantifies geographic inequities in loss of life expectancy by area level socioeconomic status and accessibility to treatment . Analysis was conducted using a population based cancer registry cohort of Queensland residents aged 5089years diagnosed between 19972016 . Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE by area level SES and accessibility for all invasive cancers and the five leading cancers . The gain in life years that could be achieved if all cancer patients experienced the same relative survival as those in the least disadvantaged high accessibility category was estimated for the 2016 cohort . For all invasive cancers men living in the most disadvantaged areas lost 34 of life expectancy due to their cancer diagnosis while those from the least disadvantaged areas lost 25 . The corresponding percentages for women were 33 and 23 . Accessibility had a lower impact on LOLE than SES with patients from low accessibility areas losing 04 more life expectancy than those from high accessibility areas . For cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 an estimated 101 387 life years will be lost . This would be reduced by 19 if all patients experienced the same relative survival as those from the least disadvantaged high accessibility areas . The impact of a cancer diagnosis on remaining life expectancy varies by geographical area . Establishing reasons why area disadvantage impacts on life expectancy is crucial to inform subsequent interventions that could increase the life expectancy of cancer patients from more disadvantaged areas .
1121,Longitudinal data are limited regarding the impact of a multidisciplinary team approach on patient outcomes among those diagnosed with lung cancer . The purpose of this study is to 1 compare 1 and 3 year recurrence and mortality rates among patients receiving a MDT vs. standard model of care and 2 assess trends in these proportions over a 10 year period . This investigation included 2044 lung cancer cases reported to the Stony Brook Cancer Registry between 2006 and 2015 . Patients were stratified into 2 groups those participating in Stony Brooks Lung Cancer Evaluation Centers MDT Program and those receiving a standard model of care . 1 and 3 year stage stratified recurrence and mortality rates are reported . Logistic regression analyses are performed and linear by linear associations are used to assess trends over time . A higher proportion of patients in the MDT program remained disease free at 1 year compared those receiving standard care . There were no significant changes in mortality over the 10 year observation period in either group however the rates were significantly lower among LCEC vs non LCEC cases after adjusting for possible confounders at 1 year OR 0.50 at 3 years . Recurrence was also lower at 3 years in the MDT group . This study suggests that a comprehensive MDT program for lung cancer yields improved patient outcomes compared to the standard model of care and this approach may help to decrease rates of disease recurrence and mortality .
1122,UK primary care referral guidance describes the signs symptoms and test results of undiagnosed cancer . Guidance revision in 2015 liberalised investigation by introducing more low risk features . We studied adults with cancer whose features were in the 2005 guidance or were introduced in the revision . We compared time to diagnosis between the groups and its trend over 20062017 . Clinical Practice Research Datalink records were analysed for adults with incident myeloma breast bladder colorectal lung oesophageal ovarian pancreatic prostate stomach or uterine cancers in 1 1 200631 12 2017 . Cancer specific features in the year before diagnosis were used to create New NICE and Old NICE groups . Diagnostic interval was time between the index feature and diagnosis . Semiparametric varying coefficient analyses compared diagnostic intervals between New NICE and Old NICE groups over 1 1 200631 12 2017 . Over all cancers median Old NICE diagnostic interval rose over 20062017 from 51 to 64 days with increases in breast lung ovarian prostate and stomach cancers . Median New NICE values were consistently longer than Old NICE values over all cancers . After guidance revision New NICE diagnostic intervals became shorter than Old NICE values for colorectal cancer . Despite improvements for colorectal cancer scope remains to reduce diagnostic intervals for most cancers . Liberalised investigation requires protecting and enhancing cancer diagnostic services to avoid their becoming a rate limiting step in the diagnostic pathway .
1123,Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease treated with immunosuppressive agents thrombopoietin receptor agonists immunomodulation drugs and or splenectomy . Patients with ITP have been found to have increased risk ofhematological malignancies . Studies investigating stomach liver cancer are contradictory and the risk of developing other solid tumors is largely unknown . We aimed at estimating risk of overall and organ specific cancers in patients with primary ITP . The study population was Swedish patients with at least one ITP diagnosis recorded in the National Patient Register and a 1 10 matched comparison cohort from the population . The study period covers 19972016 . The Cancer Register and the Cause of Death Register provided data on malignancies and deaths respectively . Primary ITP was identified using an established algorithm . We used time split Cox models to estimate hazard ratios with 95 confidence intervals adjusted for age sex index year county income education Charlson score and number of in and outpatient contacts . In total 66 134 individuals were included in the study . Patients with ITP had higher risk of gastro intestinal skin lymphoid and hematological cancers . Adjusted HR for cancer was 1.37 with highest risk during the first year but with increased risk remaining for up to 20 years for men . For women the overall risk was increased during the first year HR 2.00 . A significantly increased liver cancer risk was seen up to 9 years after diagnosis . Patients with primary ITP have higher risk of cancer than the population . The observed increased risk does not seem to be solely due to surveillance bias but might be associated with ITP or its treatments . Treating hematologists need to have high index of suspicion for cancer .
1124,While the chemoprevention effect of aspirin is well established the effects of metformin in cancer prevention is still controversial . This study is to investigate the use of aspirin metformin or the combination of both is associated with delayed cancer incidence . This dataset is based on the electronic medical record of public hospitals in Hong Kong . Patients were classified into 1. aspirin user 2. metformin user 3. both aspirin and metformin user and 4. control group with neither aspirin nor metformin used . Aspirin and or metformin must have been taken for over 6 months in the treatment group and cancer incidences was counted at least 6 months after exposure to such medications . The primary outcome of this study was overall incidence of cancer during the follow up period . The secondary outcomes were cancer incidences of specific sites including colon rectum liver oesophagus pancreas stomach lung breast kidney bladder and prostate . Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios of cancer risks . Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for the medication effects . A total of 120 971 aspirin users 11 365 metformin users and 6630 aspirin plus metformin users were identified . Compare to the control groups those who used aspirin alone demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cancer risk . Similarly those who used metformin alone also showed an overall reduction in cancer risk . Patients who received both aspirin and metformin showed the most significant reduction in overall cancer risk . Metformin showed a significant reduction in cancer risk of lung oesophagus and bladder . There is a similar decrease in overall cancer rate with the use of aspirin or metformin alone . A more significant reduction in overall cancer risk was found with the use of both agents .
1125,Persons with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of developing colorectal tumors . Adherence to diet quality indices associated with colorectal cancer risk in the general population has not been studied before in LS . Dietary habits of 490 participants with LS from a prospective cohort study was collected using a food frequency questionnaire . The Dutch Healthy Diet index 2015 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension were used to score food based diet quality . Diet quality scores were divided into tertiles where a higher tertile reflects a higher diet quality . Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between the DHD15 index DASH score and CRT risk . During a median follow up time of 53.4 months 210 participants developed CRTs . The DHD index and DASH score were not associated with CRT risk hazard ratios for highest vs. lowest tertile were 1.00 0.67 1.48 and 1.11 respectively . No linear trends across the DHD index and DASH score tertiles were observed . In contrast to observations in the general population no evidence for an association between the food based DHD15 index or DASH score and CRT risk was observed in persons with LS . Further studies are needed investigating the association between diet quality and mechanisms leading to the development of LS associated tumors .
1126,Measuring progress against cancer is more accurate when trends in incidence survival and mortality are interpreted simultaneously . Our study aims to analyze how these key metrics have evolved over time in the Azores Portugal . Data for incident cases diagnosed in 19972016 and followed up through December 31 2017 were obtained from the Azores Cancer Registry . Data for cancer deaths that occurred in 19912016 were obtained from Statistics Portugal . To estimate temporal trends we applied a joinpoint model to age adjusted rates . We estimated five year net survival within the framework of relative survival using the Pohar Perme estimator and predicted the number of cases and deaths in 2025 . In men incidence and mortality decreased for stomach larynx and prostate cancer . In women mortality decreased for breast and cervical cancer . Five year relative survival improved for several cancers with the most pronounced improvements for prostate cancer in men and colorectal cancer in women . Conversely incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women . The incidence and mortality burdens are both expected to increase in 2025 . Overall progress against cancer in the Azores has been mixed and much of the progress has been driven by advances in treatment . Statistics for lung cancer in women and colorectal cancer in men are a call to action for policymakers . Reducing tobacco use and tackling the obesity epidemic are the two public health priorities for cancer control within the region .
1127,Outdoor artificial light at night has been implicated in a growing number of adverse health outcomes . ALAN is believed to disrupt circadian rhythms and has been associated with increased inflammation one of the hallmarks of cancer . We examined the association between outdoor ALAN and a cancer strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions non Hodgkin lymphoma in the prospective California Teachers Study cohort . Outdoor ALAN was assigned to participant addresses at study baseline through use of the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness . Among 105 937 women followed from 1995 to 2015 linkage to the California Cancer Registry identified 873 incident cases of NHL . Age stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for overall NHL and the most common NHL subtypes diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Multivariate analyses adjusted for previously reported subtype specific covariates for DLBCL . Compared to the lowest quintile participants residing in the highest quintile of outdoor ALAN at baseline were more likely to develop NHL and in particular DLBCL . The elevated risk for DLBCL remained statistically significant after adjusting for age race ethnicity BMI and socioeconomic status . There was no association between ALAN and FL or CLL SLL . DLBCL risk was elevated among women residing in neighborhoods with greater outdoor ALAN . Future research in circadian disruption and DLBCL may clarify potential biological processes implicated in this association .
1128,Although there is some evidence of positive associations between both the glycemic index and glycemic load with cancer risk the relationships with lung cancer risk remain largely unexplored . We evaluated the associations between GI and GL with lung cancer . The analyses were performed using data from a population based case control study recruited between 1999 and 2004 in Los Angeles County . Dietary factors were collected from 593 incident lung cancer cases and 1026 controls using a modified food frequency questionnaire . GI and GL were estimated using a food composition table . Adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders . Dietary GI was positively associated with lung cancer . For histologic subtypes positive associations were observed between GI and adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma . No clear association between GL and lung cancer was observed . These findings suggest that high dietary GI was associated with increased lung cancer risk and the positive associations were observed for both lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma . Replication in an independent dataset is merited for a broader interpretation of our results .
1129,Background Evidence suggests that geographic location may independently contribute to ovarian cancer survival . We aimed to investigate how the association between residential location and ovarian cancer specific survival in California varies by race ethnicity and socioeconomic status .
1130,The effect of inequalities aggravated by economic recessions in the mortality rates of certain diseases has been previously described . In this study we analyzed the relationship between socio economic deprivation and cancer mortality . We focused on lung colon prostate and breast cancers in nine European urban areas over three periods two before and one after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis . This is an ecological study of trends . The units of analysis were small areas within nine European urban areas . We used a composite deprivation index as a socio economic indicator . As a mortality indicator we used the smoothed standardized mortality ratio calculated using the hierarchical Bayesian model proposed by Besag York and Molli . To analyze the evolution of socio economic inequalities we fitted an ecological regression model that included the socio economic indicator the period of time and the interaction between these terms . In men socio economic inequalities in all cancer and lung cancer mortality were observed in most of the cities studied but did not increase after the onset of the economic crisis . In women only two cities showed socio economic inequalities in all cancer and lung cancer mortality there was also no increase in inequalities . Our results did not validate our hypothesis that inequalities increase in times of crisis . However they emphasize the importance of socio economic measurements for understanding mortality inequalities and can be used to inform prevention strategies and help plan local health programs aimed at reducing health inequalities .
1131,In the UK inequalities exist in prostate cancer incidence survival and treatment by area deprivation and rurality . This work aimed to identify variation in patient reported outcomes of men with prostate cancer by area type . A population based survey of men 1842 months after prostate cancer diagnosis measured self assessed health using the EQ 5D and five functional domains using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite . Mean SAH was higher for men in least deprived areas compared to most deprived . SAH scores were lower for men in most urban areas compared to most rural . Equivalent estimates in the general population reported a 13 point difference by deprivation and a 4 point difference by rurality . For each EPIC 26 domain functional outcomes were better for men in the least deprived areas with clinically meaningful differences observed for urinary incontinence and hormonal function . There were no clinically meaningful differences in EPIC 26 outcomes by rurality with less than a three point difference in scores for each domain between urban and rural areas . In men 1842 months post diagnosis of prostate cancer in the UK impacts of area deprivation and rurality on self assessed health related quality of life were not greater than would be expected in the general population . However clinically meaningful differences were identified for some prostate functional outcomes by deprivation . No impact by rurality of residence was identified .
1132,Experimental studies have suggested a role for sex hormones in the etiology of colorectal cancer but epidemiological data are inconclusive . We examined the associations of testosterone estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin with risk of CRC in 206 508 men and 219 106 women enrolled in the UK Biobank . Participants were followed for a median of 7.1 years . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for CRC risk . In men in multivariable adjusted models testosterone and SHBG were not associated with CRC . Among men in the highest tertile of physical activity SHBG was inversely associated with risk HR The results of this study did not provide support for associations of sex hormones and SHBG with CRC risk .
1133,There is a lack of information about the burden of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . The present work aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of mCRPC in 2014 using the French nationwide healthcare database . Prevalence and incidence were estimated based on an SNDS extraction of men covered by the general healthcare insurance and aged 40 . Patients with mCRPC were identified amongst prostate cancer cases using an algorithm estimating a date of first metastasis management and a date of castration resistance . This algorithm was validated by clinical experts through a blind review of 200 anonymized medical charts from SNDS data . Prevalence and incidence were standardized on the European Standard Population . Prevalence and incidence of mCRPC were estimated as respectively 62 and 21 cases per 100 000 men in 2014 . Less than one mCRPC case per 100 000 was observed in men aged 4049 . Maximum mCRPC incidence was in men aged 8089 . The algorithm used for mCRPC identification had 97 positive and 99 negative predictive values . The good performances of the algorithm for mCRPC identification and the consistency of the generated results with the existing data highlight the robustness of these first estimates of mCRPC prevalence and incidence . Future updates will call for algorithm adjustment as practices evolve over time . These first real life data will serve for future follow up of the impact of changes in the management of prostate cancer .
1134,p.Gly84Glu is recognized as a rare variant associated with increased risk for prostate cancer risk association for other cancers is uncertain . This HOXB13 variant was originally reported in several 3 generation prostate cancer pedigrees and has been reported to be associated with increased risk for bladder and colorectal cancer and leukemia in GWAS .
1135,Population based studies on the epidemiology of HCC are scarce . We aimed to compare CG with NCG analyze incidence etiology and survival among patients diagnosed in Iceland in a population based cohort . A previous study from Iceland showed an incidence of HCC of 1.1 100.000 mostly with NCG . A nationwide population based retrospective study . Information on patients with HCC during 19982017 was obtained and medical records viewed . Overall 152 patients with HCC were identified . The mean incidence was 1.7 100.000 and increased by 8 annually . Alcohol and hepatitis C combined was more common as a risk factor in CG than in the NCG . Tumor size was larger in NCG and portal vein thrombosis less common . Overall 44 in NCG underwent surgical treatment vs. 23 in CG . The proportion of patients diagnosed by surveillance in 19982007 was 3 and 19 in 20082017 . The disease specific median survival for cirrhotic patients diagnosed by surveillance was 519 days and 86 days in other cirrhotic patients hazard ratio 0.45 . A major increase in the incidence of patients with HCC has occurred . The non cirrhotic HCC presented with larger size tumors lower proportion of portal vein thrombosis and were more likely to be surgical candidates although not affecting prognosis . Diagnosis by surveillance in patients with cirrhosis has increased and the survival of those patients is better compared to others .
1136,Cancer of Unknown Primary is a metastatic disease for which the primary tumour origin could not be identified during life . Few studies have investigated the risk factors associated with this disease . This study investigates anthropometry physical activity and CUP risk . Data is used from the Netherlands Cohort Study which includes 120 852 participants aged 5569 years . All cohort members completed a self administered questionnaire on cancer risk factors at baseline in 1986 . Cancer follow up was established through record linkage to the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch Pathology Registry . After a follow up of 20.3 years 926 incident CUP cases and 4099 subcohort members were available for case cohort analyses . Proportional hazards models were used to compute multivariable adjusted hazard ratios . We found no associations between height body mass index at baseline BMI at age 20 years change in BMI since age 20 years clothing size or non occupational physical activity and CUP risk . Our findings indicate that neither anthropometry nor physical activity are associated with the development of CUP .
1137,The aim of this study was to compare quality performance of the first colorectal cancer screening campaigns with the OC Sensor Faecal Immunological Test and the Hemoccult guaiac based test . The participation rate of the eligible population screening fecal occult blood test performance indices CRC and adenoma detection rate and time interval between test positivity and colonoscopy were studied . In C7 35.9 of the eligible population completed the screening process versus 47.6 in C1 . The positivity rate was of 4.3 for OC Sensor FIT and 2.3 for Hemoccult test . A total of 3 252 colonoscopies were performed in C7 versus 2 005 in C1 246 CRCs and 1 160 advanced adenomas were detected in C7 compared to 140 CRCs and 491 AA in C1 . The FOBT cancer detection rate increased significantly from 1.4 to 2.9 between the two campaigns as did the FOBT AA detection rate from 5.7 to 13.7 . During C7 the mean time for colonoscopy after a positive FIT result was 84.3 days . There was no significant difference between the stages at diagnosis according to the time for colonoscopy within the first 6 months . CRC and AA detection rates increased significantly between the two campaigns . Longer follow up will be required to show a potential decrease in the incidence of invasive CRCs .
1138,The relationship between deprivation and oral cancer is complex . We examined magnitude and shape of deprivation related inequalities in oral cancer in England 2012 2016 . Oral cancer was indicated by cancers of the lip and oral cavity and lip oral cavity and pharynx and deprivation by the Index of Multiple Deprivation . Deprivation inequality in incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer outcomes was measured using the Relative Index of Inequality . Fractional polynomial regression was used to explore the shape of the relationships between deprivation and oral cancer outcomes . Multivariate regression models were fitted with the appropriate functions to examine the independent effect of deprivation on cancer adjusting for smoking alcohol and ethnicity . Incidence rate ratios and mortality rate ratios were greater for more deprived areas . The RII values indicated significant inequalities for oral cancer outcomes but the magnitude of inequalities were greater for mortality . The relationships between deprivation and oral cancer outcomes were curvilinear . Deprivation Asian ethnicity and alcohol consumption were associated with higher incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer . This is the first study to our knowledge exploring the shape of socioeconomic inequalities in oral cancer at neighbourhood level . Deprivation related inequalities were present for all oral cancer outcomes with a steeper rise at the more deprived end of the deprivation spectrum . Deprivation predicted oral cancer even after accounting for other risk factors .
1139,The aim of this study was to describe survival of lymphoid neoplasms in the Girona province during 19962015 . Data were extracted from the Girona cancer registry . LN incident cases were registered using the ICD O 3 following the 2008 WHO classification scheme and HAEMACARE grouping . Follow up was available until the 31 12 2015 . Observed and relative survival were estimated with Kaplan Meier and Pohar Perme methods respectively . 4294 LNs diagnosed over a 20 year period were included in the survival analyses . 5 year RS was 62.3 60.464.4 and ranged from 88.5 41.1 according to subtype . Findings were similar between men and women while survival decreased markedly with age . RS for all LNs improved during the first two periods of study being 56.5 in 19962002 64.8 in 20032008 and 65.6 in 20092015 . This pattern was mostly attributed to an improved survival of mature B cell neoplasms yet only statistically significant differences were reported for follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma subtypes . Our study provides estimates of survival in LNs and its subtypes allowing comparisons between countries . Survival for overall cases improved across the period of study yet rates are still poor for most subtypes evidencing the need of therapeutic research programs .
1140,BowelScreen The National Bowel Screening Programme in Ireland offers free colorectal screening to persons aged 60 69 through a home Faecal Immunochemical Test kit . 40.2 uptake in the first screening round was below the programme standard . To improve uptake an intervention saw FIT kits sent directly to previously screened clients rather than by the usual invitation process comprising a letter of invitation followed by a FIT kit if requested . The intervention proved successful and was fully implemented into the programme for subsequent clients . Despite the improved uptake it was noted over time that the unsatisfactory FIT rate was approaching the programme standard . The aim of this study is to compare uptake by two invite methods occurring contemporaneously alongside advertising and to compare unsatisfactory rates before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Percentage uptake and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each invite method before and after advertising and compared using two proportion z tests . Rate ratios and 95 CI compared the unsatisfactory FIT rate before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Uptake was significantly higher amongst FIT Direct compared with Usual Invite clients during and outside advertising . The unsatisfactory FIT rate was 2.3 times higher after full FIT Direct implementation compared with before . The FIT Direct intervention had an overall positive effect on uptake . After adjusting for advertising uptake of FIT was higher outside advertising periods . Monitoring of the unsatisfactory rate is ongoing a communication enhancement strategy may be required should this persist .
1141,Pre existing chronic conditions influence the diagnosis and management of cancer . The prevalence of specific morbidities in patients diagnosed with common and rarer cancers is inadequately described . Using data from the English National Cancer Diagnosis Audit 2014 we studied 11 pre existing morbidities recorded as yes no items by participating general practitioners based on information included in primary care records . We examined the number and type of morbidities across socio demographic and cancer site strata and subsequently estimated observed and age sex standardised prevalence of each morbidity by cancer . Over three quarters of non screen detected patients had at least one chronic condition before diagnosis while nearly half had two or more . Hypertension and physical disability were the most and least common conditions . Male older and more socio economically deprived patients were more likely to have at least one morbidity . For most morbidities the standardised prevalence was similar across different cancers with a few exceptions including respiratory disease prevalence being greatest among lung cancer patients and diabetes prevalence being greatest among liver pancreatic and endometrial cancer patients . Most cancer patients have at least one morbidity while almost one in two have two or more . The findings highlight the need to take certain morbidity and cancer site combinations into account when examining associations between morbidity and cancer outcomes .
1142,The Lauren classification of gastric adenocarcinoma describes three histological subtypes the intestinal the diffuse and the mixed type carcinoma . The metastatic pattern of gastric adenocarcinoma by histological subtype has not been studied . Gastric adenocarcinoma patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis between 1999 and 2017 were identified through the Netherlands Cancer Registry . The Lauren classification was determined based on pathology reports archived in the Dutch Pathology Registry and was linked to individual cases in the Netherlands Cancer Registry . Among 8 231 newly diagnosed metastatic and evaluable gastric adenocarcinoma patients 57 had an intestinal type carcinoma 38 patients had a diffuse type carcinoma and 5 had a mixed type carcinoma . Intestinal type carcinomas more often metastasized to the liver and lungs whereas diffuse type carcinomas more often metastasized to the peritoneum and bones . Patients with a diffuse type carcinoma had a worse survival perspective regardless of the number or the location of the metastases . In this national cohort study metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type had a predilection for the liver and that of the diffuse type for the peritoneum .
1143,Previous studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor The study used a population based cohort of 1534 non squamous NSCLC patients diagnosed in northern New Zealand between 1st February 2010 and 31st July 2017 . Cox regression survival analyses were used to explore the associations between clinicopathological factors and overall survival by In this cohort 20 had an mutation status and metastasis are the main predictors for overall survival in non squamous NSCLC patients . The effects of sex ethnicity and tumour site vary depending on
1144,The knowledge of cancer burden in the population its time trends and the possibility of international comparison is an important starting point for cancer control programmes . Our study aimed to evaluate trends in childhood cancer epidemiology of patients aged 014 years in the period 19942016 in the Czech Republic . Data on childhood cancers have been obtained from the Czech National Cancer Registry . These data were validated using the clinical database of childhood cancer patients and combined with data from death certificates . Incidence and mortality trends were assessed by the joinpoint regression method . The life tables method was used to calculate the overall age standardised five year survival . The incidence trend was stable the age standardised cancer incidence ASR was 173.7 per 1 million children in the period 19942016 . However there was apparent significant decrease in mortality ASR dropped from 58.1 per 1 million children in 1994 to 21.4 per 1 million children in 2016 . The overall five year survival increased over time by 10 . Statistically significant improvements in survival were observed in patients with lymphoid leukaemia astrocytomas neuroblastomas osteosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas . Such a relevant increase in survival rates and therefore also a decrease in mortality rates in the Czech Republic is most likely due to improvements in diagnostic and treatment methods since the 1990s which were facilitated by the concentration of childhood cancer patients in childrens cancer centres .
1145,Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have declined in Australia since the implementation of a national cervical screening program in 1991 however disparities in both measures between Indigenous and non Indigenous women remain . We describe spatial and temporal changes in Pap test participation rates by Indigenous status for Queensland . Analyses were done in the context of renewed screening program in December 2017 . Population based study 2 132 925 Queensland female residents aged 2069 years who underwent cervical screening from 2008 to December 2017 47 136 were identified as Indigenous through linkage to hospital records . Bayesian spatial models were used to generate smoothed estimates of participation across 528 small areas during 20082012 and 20132017 compared to the overall state average . Results are presented as thematic maps and graphs showing the associated uncertainty of the estimates . Overall screening participation decreased over time for both Indigenous and non Indigenous women . Strong spatial patterns were evident in five year participation for both groups . Indigenous women had significantly lower participation than the Queensland average for 88 of areas during both reporting periods whereas corresponding estimates were lower than average for 30 of areas among non Indigenous women . Disparities by Indigenous status persisted over time and remained across broader geographical groups of accessibility and area disadvantage . Cervical cancer burden in Australia can only be reduced through concentrated efforts on identifying and addressing key drivers of the continuing disparities in screening participation . Achieving equitable screening participation for all women especially Indigenous women requires community engagement and localised interventions .

1299,Six operational parameters including fish part antioxidant use water addition enzyme types enzyme concentration and hydrolysis time were studied about their effect on nutritional composition of oil enzymatically extracted from farmed Atlantic salmon by products . Compared to the oil extracted from salmon viscera the oil extracted from mixture of salmon heads and frames had higher amounts of triacylglycerols omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and lower amounts of omega 6 PUFAs . The interaction between water and high levels of hydrolysis time or enzyme concentration resulted in decreased TAG content increased content of phospholipids and increased omega 6 PUFA content . The addition of antioxidant significantly increased the average content of omega 6 PUFAs but decreased EPA and DHA amounts in viscera oil due to the pro antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid . The use of Alcalase Flavourzyme or SEBPRo didn t result in any significant difference in oil composition under studied conditions . The negative correlation between amounts of TAG and free fatty acid indicates that the increase of FFA content resulted in the decrease of TAG content mainly due to the oxidation of TAG promoted by FFAs .

1306,This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the antimicrobial activity of lemongrass oil in its normal and nanoform against four microbial strains previously isolated from a historical parchment manuscript dated back to the third century AH . In addition examine their impact on the aesthetic physical and chemical characteristics of the disinfected parchment before and after artificial aging . The nanoemulsion of the oil was prepared using the low energy emulsification technique . The antimicrobial activity of Lg EO and Lg NE was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively . Fourier transform infrared scanning electron microscopy tensile strength and elongation and color change investigations were conducted to monitor any chemical morphological mechanical or physical variations of treated parchment samples before and after artificial aging . The obtained results declared that preparing essential oils in the form of nanoemulsions improves their antimicrobial performance that facilitates achieving biocidal activity in lower concentrations without adversely affecting any of the examined characteristics of the disinfected parchment . On the other hand using the oil in its normal state affected the optical properties of treated samples before and after aging . Additionally while improving the mechanical properties of the disinfected parchment the accelerated aging of the treated samples had brought about an obvious decrease in those properties . Thus essential oils nanoemulsions which are considered an ecofriendly system can be used effectively in the disinfection of historical parchment manuscripts without any adverse effect on their distinctive characteristics .

1308,Alphaviruses are transmitted by an arthropod vector to a vertebrate host . The disease pathologies cellular environments immune responses and host factors are very different in these organisms . Yet the virus is able to infect replicate and assemble into new particles in these two animals using one set of genetic instructions . The balance between conserved mechanisms and unique strategies during virus assembly is critical for fitness of the virus . In this review we discuss new findings in receptor binding polyprotein topology nucleocapsid core formation and particle budding that have emerged in the last five years and share opinions on how these new findings might answer some questions regarding alphavirus structure and assembly .

1310,Dengue virus infects several million people each year . Although usually a self limiting disease some patients can develop life threatening severe complications characterized by plasma leakage hemorrhaging and shock . The signs and symptoms of severe disease usually arise late in the disease course when patients are recovering and fever has subsided making it difficult to predict . Efforts are underway to identify risk factors and biomarkers that can accurately predict disease severity in the acute febrile phase of the disease facilitating early intervention and treatment strategies for those at greatest risk . In this review we discuss recent advancements in identifying risk factors and biomarkers for the prognosis of severe dengue .
1311,Bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria are the most abundant biological entities on Earth . Siphophages accounting for 60 of known phages bear a long flexible tail that allows host recognition and safe delivery of the DNA from the capsid to the cytoplasm of the infected cell . Independently from their host and the nature of their receptor at its surface the core tail architecture of all caudophages and of bacterial phage derived contractile injection systems share the same structural organisation and are thought to be homologous . Here we review the recent advances in the structure function and assembly of the core tail architecture of siphophages .
1312,Emerging viral diseases pose a major threat to public health worldwide . Nearly all emerging viruses including Ebola Dengue Nipah West Nile Zika and coronaviruses have zoonotic origins indicating that animal to human transmission constitutes a primary mode of acquisition of novel infectious diseases . Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood . Differences in the host immune response especially within the innate compartment have been suggested to be involved in this divergence . Natural killer cells are innate lymphocytes that play a critical role in the early antiviral response secreting effector cytokines and clearing infected cells . In this review we will discuss the mechanisms through which NK cells interact with viruses their contribution towards maintaining equilibrium between the virus and its natural host and their role in disease progression in humans and other non natural hosts .
1313,Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod borne RNA viruses causing a broad spectrum of life threatening disease symptoms such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever . Successful vaccines exist against yellow fever virus Japanese encephalitis virus and tick borne encephalitis virus . However vaccine development against other flaviviruses like dengue virus is not straightforward . This is partly because of the high sequence conservation and immunological cross reactivity among flavivirus envelope glycoproteins leading to antibody mediated enhancement of disease . A comprehensive analyses of the structural landscape of humoral immune response against flaviviruses is crucial for antigen design . Here we compare the available structural data of several flavivirus antibody complexes with a major focus on Zika virus and dengue virus and discuss the mapped epitopes the stoichiometry of antibody binding and mechanisms of neutralization .
1314,Despite the high disease burden of dengue virus there is no approved antiviral treatment or broadly applicable vaccine to treat or prevent dengue virus infection . In the last decade many antiviral compounds have been identified but only few have been further evaluated in pre clinical or clinical trials .

Furthermore important parameters for further development that is drug properties including efficacy specificity and stability pre clinical animal testing and combinational drug therapy will be discussed .
1315,Dendritic cells are pivotal stimulators of T cell responses . They provide essential signals to T cells and prime adaptive immunity . Therefore they are paramount to immunization strategies geared to generate T cell immunity . The inflammatory signals DCs respond to classically occur in the context of acute virus infection . Yet enlisting viruses for engaging DCs is hampered by their penchant for targeting DCs with sophisticated immune evasive and suppressive ploys . In this review we discuss our work on devising vectors based on a recombinant polio rhinovirus chimera for effectively targeting and engaging DCs . We are juxtaposing this approach with commonly used recently studied dsDNA virus vector platforms .
1316,Human cytomegalovirus is a nearly ubiquitous herpesvirus that establishes latent infection in the majority of the world s population . HCMV infection profoundly influences the host immune system and perhaps more than any other human pathogen has been shown to create a lasting imprint on human T and NK cell compartments . HCMV seropositivity has been associated with both beneficial effects such as increased vaccine responsiveness or heterologous protection against infections and deleterious effects such as pathological neurodevelopmental sequelae from congenital infection in utero and cumulative damage from chronic lifelong latency into old age . The significance of many of these associations is unclear as studies into the causal mechanisms linking HCMV and these disease outcomes are lacking however HCMV mediated changes to the immune system may play a key role . This review examines how HCMV impacts the host immune system in an age dependent manner with important implications for human immunophenotypes and long term disease risk .
1317,Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that usurp cellular signaling networks to promote pathogen spread and disease progression . Signaling through extracellular vesicles is an emerging field of study in the virus host interaction network . EVs relay information both locally and distally through incorporated contents typically without tripping innate immune sensors . Therefore this extracellular signaling axis presents itself as a tantalizing target for promoting a favorable niche for the pathogen takeover of the host particularly for chronic infections . From the incorporation of virus encoded molecules such as micro RNAs and proteins enzymes to the envelopment of entire infectious particles evolutionary distinct viruses have shown a remarkable ability to converge on this means of communication . In this review we will cover the recent advances in this field and explore how EV can be used as potential biomarkers for chronic persistent or latent virus infections .
1318,DNA or mRNA vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines since they are easier to manufacture and have higher safety profiles . In particular self amplifying RNA derived from alphavirus expression vectors has shown to be very efficient to induce humoral and cellular responses against many antigens in preclinical models being superior to non replicating mRNA and DNA . This is mainly due to the fact that saRNA can provide very high expression levels and simultaneously induces strong innate responses potentiating immunity . saRNA can be administered as viral particles or DNA but direct delivery as RNA represents a safer and more simple approach . Although saRNA can be delivered as naked RNA
1319,Productive virus infection depends upon delivery of viral genomic material into the host cell cytoplasm . The tails of bacteriophages recognize host cells and mediate host cell wall and membrane penetration . Recent cryo electron microscopy studies have revealed near atomic resolutions structures of the entire or almost entire bacteriophage particles of model systems including phi29 P22 P68 and T4 . These structures allow comparisons between not only different states of the same phage but also between distantly related phages . In this review we summarize the findings from recent structural studies of the bacteriophages that target Gram positive bacteria for a better understanding of the interactions between host cells and bacteriophages .
1320,The first licensed dengue vaccine led to considerable controversy and to date no dengue vaccine is in widespread use . All three leading dengue vaccine candidates are live attenuated vaccines with the main difference between them being the type of backbone and the extent of chimerization . While CYD TDV does not include non structural proteins of dengue TAK 003 contains the dengue virus serotype 2 backbone and the Butantan Merck vaccine contains three full genomes of the four dengue virus serotypes . While dengue primed individuals can already benefit from vaccination against all four serotypes with the first licensed dengue vaccine CYD TDV the need for dengue naive population has not yet been met . To improve tetravalent protection sequential vaccination should be considered in addition to a heterologous prime boost approach .
1321,Influenza B virus is a respiratory pathogen that affects more severely the pediatric and elderly populations . There are two lineages of influenza B virus that seem to have differential predilection for age groups . Both lineages can co circulate during the influenza season however one is usually more prominent than the other depending on the season . There are no defined indicators to predict which lineage will dominate in any given season . In recent years the addition of viruses from both lineages to the seasonal influenza vaccine formulation has improved vaccine protection although quadrivalent vaccines are not available worldwide . Reverse genetics has facilitated advancements in the field of vaccine development against influenza B virus . Different strategies have been explored showing promising results that could potentially lead to the development broadly protective influenza B virus vaccines .

1324,A network is usually embedded in a larger network and interacts with other networks simultaneously while the networks in network science literature are generally examined independently . The trade values can generally reflect periodical flows of cargo types and values between two economies while the geographical and transportation details can not be embodied although they are important for national logistics and supply chains . We investigate the vessel flows between two national maritime networks activated by possible implications to trade and shipping investments . The maritime network of flows between China and Vietnam is figured as a typical example under the consideration that the two countries are both typical maritime countries and the development of China is slowing down while Vietnam s economy and trade are booming . Using five years mutual connectivity data between Vietnam and China the flow directions and amounts are estimated and examined by network and flow analyzing methods . Maritime convection is introduced to investigate the changing cargo flows that represents supply chains between the two countries . Maritime fluctuation is used to study the strength and tendencies of seaborne trade between the two countries . These two aspects are visualized and conceptualized in the context of China s Belt and Road Initiative . New maritime interconnection facilities and opportunities are then discussed based on the results from this analysis . All methods for developing the networks and metrics of convection and fluctuation are incorporated into a system framework . So the proposed method can be used for general network relation analysis especially when the networks are connected by flows .
1325,Transportation is one of the logistical drivers in supply chains . Transportation disruption is costly in supply chains . This paper aims to assess transportation disruption risks using a Bayesian Belief Network . First the disruption risk factors and their sub factors were identified from the relevant articles and experts opinions . The BBN based model is developed to calculate the marginal probabilities of the risk factors and their sub factors to determine the most sensitive factors sub factors . The framework was demonstrated using an example case of the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh . The findings reveal the usefulness of BBN in examining transportation disruptions in supply chains . BBN captured the interdependencies between the disruption risk factors sub factors effectively . The proposed model will be useful to managers for predicting transportation disruptions and to build resilient strategies to tackle them .

1327,The Taiwan High Speed Rail has transformed transportation in western Taiwan . Increasing costs of construction and operation have rendered THSR tickets much more expensive than other forms of transportation . The effects of ticket price benefits on the relevant transportation agency and the distribution of passenger flow have been analyzed to improve the profitability of the THSR . However relying on analysis of passenger flow information alone may be insufficient to the adjustment of ticket fares . An evolutionary optimization model for maximizing the profits of the transportation agency that considers conflicts between executive decision making and passenger flow was developed herein . To resolve these conflicts the bi level planning approach was applied to consider both upper level and lower level planning and reflect passenger behavior and transportation profit management . Therefore developing business plans and strategies that maximize cost efficiency while optimally balancing passenger satisfaction and profitability could improve THSR performance . Results indicated that optimal fare rates should be divided into three groups 3.1 3.0 and 4.2 NTD person km for long medium and short distances respectively . This tool could be used to model and validate THSR fare adjustments and as a reference for authorities when making policy recommendations .

1329,Airline ancillary services play an increasingly important role in the airline industry . Ancillary revenues account for more than 40 of the total revenue for airlines like Spirit VivaAerobus and Frontier . However current academic research has addressed this practical topic on only a limited scale . Almost no research has focused on the ancillary services of the Chinese aviation market . It is likely that in the future China will outdistance the United States as the world s largest aviation market indicating the importance of the Chinese market . Accordingly this article focuses on one of the airline ancillary services namely paying extra to choose economy class seats . A mixed methods approach was used to explore factors influencing Chinese air consumers willingness to pay for economy class seat selection . Our findings show that both intrinsic cues and extrinsic cues have a significant impact on Chinese airline consumers willingness to pay for ECSS . The results of this research could contribute to enhancing the current ancillary services literature uncovering insights about Chinese airline consumers and providing implications to the marketing of airline ancillary services .
1330,Drivers can make significant impacts on transportation systems . They can leave important information due to their social behaviors . But the role of drivers has been overlooked yet . In this paper for the first time drivers collaboration network is introduced . The network is considered in a heterogenous form because of existence multiple relationships between drivers in the real world situation . Since drivers do not belong to only one community the overlapping of communities is considered and a new overlapping community detection algorithm is developed to discover the hidden structure of the network . Also we present a new overlapping score to improve the community detection algorithm using the adjacencies among non memeber neighbor nodes and communities . Solving the algorithm will lead to discovering dense communities of drivers that have meaningful relationships with each other . This will result in a better understanding of the transportation network and also improving the overall performance of the system . A comparison of the developed algorithm with the others demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm . To evaluate the applicability of the algorithm a real drivers collaboration network is presented and the developed algorithm is applied to derive insights .
1331,In the cruise operations management literature scant knowledge is available regarding the choice of ports of call . Hence insight into cruise lines decisions to visit a given port through a two step decision making process may provide an effective means to inform cruise operations management . Based on a novel perspective on cruise online ratings and reviews this research applied a Heckman double hurdle approach to 505 global cruise ports to analyze the patterns of cruise visits . Results revealed that the number of cruise visits were significantly related to cruise port ratings excursion ratings and the number of reviews . Next Sobel Goodman mediation tests showed that online platforms had substantial mediating effects on cruise port ratings . Further robustness checks based on two sub samples demonstrated that the empirical results of the double hurdle models were reliable . This paper provides the first empirical attempt to demonstrate the nexus between cruise lines and ports in an online platform context . The empirical findings provide implications for source credibility theory and cruise operations management . They are also believed to be useful for researchers in operations management studies business practitioners in international cruising policymakers and port authorities .
1332,Ride sourcing has recently been at the centre of attention as the most disruptive mode of transport associated with the so called shared mobility era . Drivers riders the platform policymakers and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system . While ride sourcing platforms have been growing so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers . That is why understanding drivers behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers and in retaining them in the presence of competence . Ride sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners . They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole . Conducting a series of focus groups with ride sourcing drivers in the Netherlands we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes . The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers which are ride acceptance relocation strategies working shift and area in which to work could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies drivers characteristics riders attributes and exogenous factors . We find that part time and full time drivers as well as experienced and beginning drivers are characterized by distinctive behaviour . Flexibility and freedom were mentioned as the key reasons for joining the platform while an unfair reputation system unreliable navigation algorithm high competition between drivers passenger oriented platform high commission fee and misleading guidance were acknowledged as being the main system drawbacks . Based on our findings we propose a conceptual model that frames the relationship between the tactical and operational decisions of drivers and related factors .
1333,This research proposes a Robust Customer Satisfaction Index for air domestic journeys which could be less sensitive to outlier data than index scores based on the American customer satisfaction index formulation . Since traveler experiences in air journeys are a chain of services related to departure airport service airline service and arrival airport service a new index for measuring passenger satisfaction for air journeys is required . In a sense then this study is the first step towards integrating satisfaction literature to propose a robust index for air journeys . The Structural Equation Model was used to validate the theoretical model . The RCSI model was tested in the context of Colombian major domestic air route where traveler s perceived quality and perceived value were found to predict significantly overall passenger satisfaction . In this study we found that the RCSI score is similar to the average for the airline industry in ACSI . The findings show that the RCSI is less sensitive to outlier data than customer satisfaction indexes based on the ACSI model formulation . The RCSI model also allows the airline and airport managers to understand the specific factors which significantly influence overall traveler satisfaction by reading the causal relationship in the RCSI model .
1334,Regulation of companies with market power in the provision of the essential services has been intended to provide incentives aimed at improving efficiency and service quality . Few studies have investigated the accountability of regulated industries and answered the question of the most appropriate accounting model for protecting consumers promoting competition and ensuring investors profitability . With the transition from an ex ante to an ex post model based on free negotiation between stakeholders on price setting and monitoring activity by an independent authority in many settings the effectiveness of the accounting model seems to be strictly related to the quantity and quality of the information that regulated companies provide on a mandatory basis in anticipation of consultations with service users and the quantity and quality of information that they voluntarily offer to stakeholders via their financial reporting . This paper aims to explore accountability relationships that emerge in regulated airport industries moving from ex ante to ex post models in order to propose a conceptual framework capable of remedying the shortcomings of the extant ones and in particular the conceptual framework established by
1335,The links between transport development and economic growth have been widely discussed in the field of transport governance and economics . However the existing studies have not included an institutional variable when exploring the role of transport development in innovation disparities within a region . In order to fill the research gap this paper examines whether transport development and the institution of intellectual property rights can assist in understanding disparities between cities in terms of innovation using the Yangtze River Delta Region as a case study . The impact mechanism is twofold . Firstly transport development can affect institutions including IPRs protection which in turn has an influence on innovation . Secondly evidence from existing economic literature suggests a link between transport development and innovation through economic agglomeration production factors and industrial flows . We first employ ordinary least squares regression to test the basic associations between transport development and innovation . We then apply two stage least squares regression analysis to address endogeneity and add a spatial model to examine neighbour effects . The findings show that IPRs protection has a positive effect on patenting and research and development while the roles played by transport development stock and density in patenting and R D are more mixed . Moreover our findings on neighbour effects show that agglomeration economies exist in the YRDR . These findings have important policy implications regarding urban agglomeration for both the YRDR specifically and China overall .

1337,The COVID 19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions and fall in consumer demand led to a dramatic and unprecedented reduction in passenger flights across Europe . As borders closed national Governments advised against all but essential travel and passenger demand disappeared European airlines were forced to quickly respond to the downturn and impose unprecedented cost saving measures to protect their business . The aim of this paper is to examine the ways in which major European passenger airlines responded to the height of the COVID 19 crisis in the period March May 2020 . Using data from Eurocontrol the European network manager the paper identifies the responses individual airline operators and parent companies took to contract and consolidate their operations . The findings show that changes to flight operations rationalising the fleet reducing staff numbers and reconfiguring their networks and capacity were the most common responses . The paper concludes by discussing future considerations for airline business and management as European carriers seek to restructure their operations and adapt to a new post COVID reality .
1338,In recent years the scientific community has witnessed an explosion in the use of pattern recognition algorithms . However little attention has been paid to the tasks preceding the execution of these algorithms the preprocessing activities . One of these tasks is dimensionality reduction in which a subset of features that improves the performance of the mining algorithm is located and algorithm s runtime is reduced . Although there are many methods that address the problems in pattern recognition algorithms effective solutions still need to be researched and explored . Hence this paper aims to address three of the issues surrounding these algorithms . First we propose adapting a promising meta heuristic called biased random key genetic algorithm which considers a random initial population construction . We call this algorithm as unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm I . Next we propose an approach for building the initial population partly in a deterministic way . Thus we applied this idea in two algorithms named unsupervised feature selection by particle swarm optimization and unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm II . Finally we simulated different datasets to study the effects of relevant and irrelevant attributes and of noisy and missing data on the performance of the algorithms . After the Wilcoxon rank sum test we can state that the proposed algorithms outperform all other methods in different datasets . It was also observed that the construction of the initial population in a partially deterministic way contributed to the better performance . It should be noted that some methods are more sensitive to noisy and missing data than others as well as to relevant and irrelevant attributes .
1339,We introduce a family of interactive evolutionary algorithms for Multiple Objective Optimization . In the phase of preference elicitation a Decision Maker is asked to compare some pairs of solutions from the current population . Such holistic information is represented by a set of compatible instances of achievement scalarizing or quasi convex preference functions which contribute to the construction of preference cones in the objective space . These cones are systematically contracted during the evolutionary search because an incremental specification of the DM s pairwise comparisons is progressively reducing the DM s most preferred region in the objective space . An inclusion of evolved solutions in this region is used along with the dominance relation to revise an elitism principle of the employed optimization algorithm . In this way the evolutionary search is focused on a subset of Pareto optimal solutions that are particularly interesting to the DM . We investigate moreover how the convergence is influenced by the use of some pre defined and newly proposed self adjusting interaction patterns . We also propose a new way for visualizing the progress of an evolutionary search . It supports understanding the differences between effects of a selection pressure imposed by various optimization algorithms .
1340,Environmental selection in Pareto based many objective evolutionary algorithms generally employ Pareto dominance relation to first consider the convergence and give higher priority to convergence than diversity . When the many objective optimization problem has a complicated Pareto front this selection strategy can easily miss the promising areas and converge into a subregion of the Pareto front . To address this issue we propose a many objective evolutionary algorithm with diversity first based environmental selection . Different from the existing selection strategies the environmental selection procedure in the proposed algorithm adopts a diversity first and convergence second principle which first selects the representative solutions that having better diversity and then considers using the well converged solutions to replace them in subregions . This selection replacement strategy can maintain the diversity and make contribution to the convergence . In addition a selection criterion termed adaptive angle penalized distance is designed to judge whether the replacement is implemented or not . The proposed algorithm is compared with five state of the art many objective evolutionary algorithms on a large number of test problems with various characteristics . Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance on many objective optimization problems .
1341,Portfolio optimization with cardinality constraints turns out to be a mixed integer quadratic programming problem which is proven to be NP Complete that limits the efficiency of exact solution approaches often because of the long running times . Therefore particular attention has been given to approximate approaches such as metaheuristics which do not guarantee optimality yet may expeditiously provide near optimal solutions . The purpose of this study is to present an efficient hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that combines critical components from continuous ant colony optimization artificial bee colony optimization and genetic algorithms for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem . Computational results on seven publicly available benchmark problems confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid integration mechanism . Moreover comparisons against other methods results in the literature reveal that the proposed solution approach is competitive with state of the art algorithms .
1342,The use of unmanned airborne agents as relays for ground agents to ensure ground network survivability is gaining traction at both theoretical and practical levels in research that targets contexts like search and rescue in disaster areas farming with autonomous equipment surveillance internet of things military operations autonomous transportation systems and many others . This comes with some challenges which include the dynamics of the ground unit behaviors the scalability of the system the mobility model of the airborne agents and the integration between ground and air agents . This paper contributes to addressing the above challenges by using a bio inspired approach that combines swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation for providing ground network survivability for a wide range of ground movement patterns . The proposed approach models ground and airborne agents as a dual air ground swarm that uses boids like rules and optimizes the movement of the airborne agents using an on line real time genetic algorithm with shadow simulation and prediction . Arguably the proposed approach provides system scalability both size wise and context wise while also offering a certain amount of integration between the ground and air swarms of agents . The results of the investigation demonstrate that the methods employed endow the airborne agents with the needed capability to ensure network survivability for complex ground activity including resilience to changes in the ground movement pattern and good responsiveness to activities that have no pattern at all such as uniform random walks .
1343,Recent years the multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition has been researched and applied for numerous optimization problems . In this study we propose an improved version of MOEA D with problem specific heuristics named PH MOEAD to solve the hybrid flowshop scheduling lot streaming problems where the variable sub lots constraint is considered to minimize four objectives i.e . the penalty caused by the average sojourn time the energy consumption in the last stage as well as the earliness and the tardiness values . For solving this complex scheduling problem each solution is coded by a two vector based solution representation i.e . a sub lot vector and a scheduling vector . Then a novel mutation heuristic considering the permutations in the sub lots is proposed which can improve the exploitation abilities . Next a problem specific crossover heuristic is developed which considered solutions with different sub lot size and therefore can make a solution feasible and enhance the exploration abilities of the algorithm as well . Moreover several problem specific lemmas are proposed and a right shift heuristic based on them is subsequently developed which can further improve the performance of the algorithm . Lastly a population initialization mechanism is embedded that can assign a fit reference vector for each solution . Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analysis the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several presented algorithms both in solution quality and population diversity .
1344,A key aspect of the design of evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms is studying their performance . Statistical comparisons are also a crucial part which allows for reliable conclusions to be drawn . In the present paper we gather and examine the approaches taken from different perspectives to summarise the assumptions made by these statistical tests the conclusions reached and the steps followed to perform them correctly . In this paper we conduct a survey on the current trends of the proposals of statistical analyses for the comparison of algorithms of computational intelligence and include a description of the statistical background of these tests . We illustrate the use of the most common tests in the context of the Competition on single objective real parameter optimisation of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017 and describe the main advantages and drawbacks of the use of each kind of test and put forward some recommendations concerning their use .
1345,One of the major problems in Big Data is a large number of features or dimensions which causes the issue of the curse of dimensionality when applying machine learning especially classification algorithms . Feature selection is an important technique which selects small and informative feature subsets to improve the learning performance . Feature selection is not an easy task due to its large and complex search space . Recently swarm intelligence techniques have gained much attention from the feature selection community because of their simplicity and potential global search ability . However there has been no comprehensive surveys on swarm intelligence for feature selection in classification which is the most widely investigated area in feature selection . Only a few short surveys is this area are still lack of in depth discussions on the state of the art methods and the strengths and limitations of existing methods particularly in terms of the representation and search mechanisms which are two key components in adapting swarm intelligence to address feature selection problems . This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state of the art works applying swarm intelligence to achieve feature selection in classification with a focus on the representation and search mechanisms . The expectation is to present an overview of different kinds of state of the art approaches together with their advantages and disadvantages encourage researchers to investigate more advanced methods provide practitioners guidances for choosing the appropriate methods to be used in real world scenarios and discuss potential limitations and issues for future research .
1346,Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis is a common clinical procedure to correct mandibular retrognathia . However since there is not a gold standard for determining the screw positions for current MDO operations deviation of distraction direction and malocclusion increases . This case results in need of additional operations that affect the callus stability . In these cases relapse risk increases and remodelling period gets longer . On the other hand large volume of the distractor plates results in more invasive treatment and negatively affects the patients comfort . To overcome these problems this study offers a new method including virtual surgery simulation determining the optimum screw configuration using particle swarm optimization loop linked between MATLAB PYTHON ANSYS programs and the design of distractor plate geometry with topology optimization . In order to test the proposed method two different Finite Element models CM and OM were established based on conventional and optimum method respectively . FEA results of the current study reveals that OM has 33.56 less displacement compared to CM and the most critical screw in terms of screw loosening for OM has 35.29 less strain value than CM . These outcomes show OM shows superior callus stability in comparison with CM . On the other hand redesign of the distractor plates using topology optimization according to the best screw positions provides 43.32 reduction in the total implant volume which means reduced cost and a less invasive MDO operation . Therefore the clinical use of this protocol is expected to increase the success of the operation by shortening the recovery period .
1347,This work presents a novel parallel branch and bound algorithm to efficiently solve to optimality a set of instances of the multi objective flexible job shop scheduling problem for the first time to the very best of our knowledge . It makes use of the well known NSGA II algorithm to initialize its upper bound . The algorithm is implemented for shared memory architectures and among its main features it incorporates a grid representation of the solution space and a concurrent priority queue to store and dispatch the pending sub problems to be solved . We report the optimal Pareto front of thirteen well known instances from the literature which were unknown before . They will be very useful for the scientific community to provide more accuracy in the performance measurement of their algorithms . Indeed we carefully analyze the performance of NSGA II on these instances comparing the results against the optimal ones computed in this work . Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm using 24 cores achieves a speedup of 15.64x with an efficiency of 65.20 .
1348,The plant disease classification based on using digital images is very challenging . In the last decade machine learning techniques and plant images classification tools such as deep learning can be used for recognizing detecting and diagnosing plant diseases . Currently deep learning technology has been used for plant disease detection and classification . In this paper an ensemble model of two pre trained convolutional neural networks namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy . In this context CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classification problem of plant diseases . However CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with specific architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters . Therefore orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by finding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method . In this paper to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efficiently an exponentially decaying learning rate schema is used . In this paper the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome . The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive . The experimental results are compared with the performance of other pre trained CNN models namely InceptionV3 and Xception whose hyperparameters were selected using a non evolutionary method . The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed diagnostic approach has achieved higher performance than the other models .
1349,Due to its practical relevance the hybrid flowshop scheduling problem has been widely studied in the literature with the objectives related to production efficiency . However studies regarding energy consumption and environmental effects have rather been limited . This paper addresses the trade off between makespan and total energy consumption in hybrid flowshops where machines can operate at varying speed levels . A bi objective mixed integer linear programming model and a bi objective constraint programming model are proposed for the problem employing speed scaling . Since the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption are conflicting with each other the augmented epsilon constraint approach is used for obtaining the Pareto optimal solutions . While close approximations for the Pareto optimal frontier are obtained for small sized instances sets of non dominated solutions are obtained for large instances by solving the MILP and CP models under a time limit . As the problem is NP hard two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm a variable block insertion heuristic and four variants of ensemble of metaheuristic algorithms are also proposed as well as a novel constructive heuristic . The performances of the proposed seven bi objective metaheuristics are compared with each other as well as the MILP and CP solutions on a set of well known HFSP benchmarks in terms of cardinality closeness and diversity of the solutions . Initially the performances of the algorithms are tested on small sized instances with respect to the Pareto optimal solutions . Then it is shown that the proposed algorithms are very effective for solving large instances in terms of both solution quality and CPU time .
1350,It is usually very difficult to elicit the parameter values of models representing decision makers preferences . Consequently some imprecision ill determination and arbitrariness are unavoidable . Moreover such elicitation can not be performed by traditional optimization techniques in a reasonable time . Therefore we present here a novel elicitation method guided by a genetic algorithm whose main contribution is coping with imperfect knowledge . The latter is done by using interval numbers representing all the possible values that the parameters can attain . The assessment of the method showed its high ability to reproduce the decision makers preferences . Finally as the method proposed in this paper is the complement of the authors previous work regarding the optimization of stock portfolios we provide a case study in such a field . We use differential evolution to obtain the most satisfactory portfolio . The results reported here show that the best portfolio returns are obtained when the elicitation method is exploited and we conclude that the new overall approach might be an interesting alternative to the already existing methods .
1351,Traditional quantum based evolutionary algorithms are intended to solve single objective optimization problems or multiobjective small scale optimization problems . However multiobjective large scale optimization problems are continuously emerging in the big data era . Therefore the research in this paper which focuses on combining quantum mechanics with multiobjective large scale optimization algorithms will be beneficial to the study of quantum based evolutionary algorithms . In traditional quantum behaved particle swarm optimization particle position uncertainty prevents the algorithm from easily falling into local optima . Inspired by the uncertainty principle of position the authors propose quantum enhanced multiobjective large scale algorithms which are parallel multiobjective large scale evolutionary algorithms . Specifically PMLEA QDE PMLEA QjDE and PMLEA QJADE are proposed by introducing the search mechanism of the individual particle from QPSO into differential evolution differential evolution with self adapting control parameters and adaptive differential evolution with optional external archive . Moreover the proposed algorithms are implemented with parallelism to improve the optimization efficiency . Verifications performed on several test suites indicate that the proposed quantum enhanced algorithms are superior to the state of the art algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency .
1352,This paper presents a two phase protein folding optimization on a three dimensional AB off lattice model . The first phase is responsible for forming conformations with a good hydrophobic core or a set of compact hydrophobic amino acid positions . These conformations are forwarded to the second phase where an accurate search is performed with the aim of locating conformations with the best energy value . The optimization process switches between these two phases until the stopping condition is satisfied . An auxiliary fitness function was designed for the first phase while the original fitness function is used in the second phase . The auxiliary fitness function includes an expression about the quality of the hydrophobic core . This expression is crucial for leading the search process to the promising solutions that have a good hydrophobic core and consequently improves the efficiency of the whole optimization process . Our differential evolution algorithm was used for demonstrating the efficiency of two phase optimization . It was analyzed on well known amino acid sequences that are used frequently in the literature . The obtained experimental results show that the employed two phase optimization improves the efficiency of our algorithm significantly and that the proposed algorithm is superior to other state of the art algorithms .
1353,Up to now different genetic algorithm based error correcting output codes algorithms have been proposed by setting accuracy as the optimization objective . However it was demonstrated that diversity among learners is of great significance to a robust ensemble . In this paper we propose a multi objective GA with setting accuracy and diversity as two objectives . To further promote diversity in an ensemble a new individual structure is designed to accommodate heterogeneous dichotomizers . Three multi objective ranking strategies are deployed to balance two objectives respectively . A novel genetic operator is designed to produce ECOC compatible offspring in the evolutionary process and a local improvement algorithm is designed to promote individuals fitness values . To verify the performance of our GA a single objective ranking strategy and the design of homogeneous learner based GA are also adopted . Ten widely used ECOC algorithms and three famous ensemble algorithms are deployed for performance comparisons based on a set of the UCI data and microarray data sets . Results show that compared with other algorithms our GA obtains higher performance in most cases due to the trade off between performance and diversity . Besides the accommodation of heterogeneous dichotomizers in an ensemble provides higher generalization ability compared with homogeneous ensembles .
1354,The Protein Structure Prediction problem is one of the most significant open problems in bioinformatics . In the AB off lattice model the protein sequence is labeled as A or B according to the amino acid classification of being hydrophobic or hydrophilic . It has been widely explored in the literature because polarity is one of the main driving forces behind protein structure definition . This work provides a high performance hybrid algorithm to approach the 3D AB off lattice model through Graphics Processing Units . The proposed hybrid algorithm named cuHjDE3D is a self adaptive Differential Evolution that uses the jDE mechanism to self adapt the DE parameters and employs the Hooke Jeeves Direct Search as the exploitation routine . The experiments were conducted on real protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank and compared against state of the art algorithms from the related literature concerning the 3D AB off lattice model . Moreover we provide a methodology to compare a 3D AB predicted conformation with its native conformation from the PDB repository using the RMSD metric . The obtained results highlight the optimization potential of the proposed method . Also the GPU running time analysis reports the positive impact of using a massively parallel architecture with speedups up to 277 promoting the necessary scalability to handle the 3D AB model .
1355,In the present research a new variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem the Environmental Prize Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem is introduced . The E PCVRP is a selective routing problem that focuses on the maximization of the aggregated prize values collected from the visited nodes while minimizing the fixed and variable cost of the formed routes . In terms of variable cost the CO2 emissions of the vehicles performing the routes are considered as a load distance function . The presented solution approach is based on the Firefly Algorithm . The FA is an optimization algorithm designed for the solution of continuous problems while the proposed E PCVRP requires a discrete solution approach . Addressing the above discrepancy the Firefly Algorithm based on Coordinates is introduced which incorporates the proposed Coordinates Related encoding decoding process in the original FA scheme . The CR is a novel process that allows for algorithms designed for continuous optimization to by employed in the solution of discrete problems such as the VRP . Specifically the CR utilizes auxiliary vectors for solution representation containing the Cartesian coordinates of each node that allows for the original movement equation of the FA to be applied directly . The effectiveness of the FAC algorithm is showed over computational experiments and statistical analysis in comparison to the performance of other bio inspired algorithms and a mathematical solver .

We carry out extensive numerical tests with the benchmarking instances . The effectiveness of local intensification as well as energy adjustment strategy is verified via the statistical comparisons . It also shows that the MMOEA D outperforms other algorithms .
1358,In consideration of the uncertainty of manufacturing system this paper investigates a distributed fuzzy blocking flow shop scheduling problem in which there are multiple homogeneous factories and each one is set as a flow shop with no intermediate buffers between any consecutive machines . The processing time is uncertain and represented by the fuzzy number . The objective is to minimize the fuzzy makespan among all factories . To address this problem two constructive heuristics are firstly proposed based on the problem specific knowledge and the NEH heuristic . The INEH employs the spread value of fuzzy processing time to generate the initial job sequence . The DPFNEH assigns the partial jobs to factories by reducing the total expected idle time and blocking time . Afterwards two iterated greedy methods are presented in which the proposed constructive heuristic is employed to generate the initial solution with high quality . A novel plateau exploration based local search is incorporated to enhance the quality of solutions . To keep the search vitality an improved acceptance criterion based on the fuzzy characteristic is designed to avoid falling into the local optimum . Finally a comprehensive computational experiment and comparisons with the state of the art methods in the literature are conducted based on an extended benchmark set and a new evaluation indicator . The results show that the proposed constructive heuristics and IG methods can effectively and efficiently solve the considered problem .
1359,This paper presents the development of the first Management Flight Simulator of an Intensive Care Unit . It allows analyzing the physician decision making related to the admission and discharge of patients and it can be used as a learningtraining tool . The discrete event simulation model developed mimics real admission and discharge processes in ICUs and it recreates the health status of the patients by using real clinical data . This flexible tool which allows recreating ICUs with different characteristics has been used and validated by ICU physicians and nurses of four hospitals . We show through preliminary results the variability among physicians in the decision making concerning the dilemma of the last bed which is dealt in a broad sense it is not only about how the last available ICU bed is assigned but also about how the physician makes decisions about the admission and discharge of patients as the ICU is getting full . The simulator is freely available on the internet to be used by any interested user
1360,Augmented reality is increasingly used as a marketing information and experience channel within the tourism industry .

Using a qualitative and exploratory approach this study conducted fifteen interviews with tourism experts in order to explore tourism specific AR value dimensions . Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis . This study revealed five value dimensions including marketing economic tourist epistemic and organisational . Commonalities and differences between different perspectives are discussed . These findings provide important implications for strategy development AR implementation and tourist experience design .
1361,Small and medium sized tourism and hospitality enterprises are often susceptible to various hazards which result in risk concerns . Insurance is recognised as one of the risk management strategies but evidence indicates that insurance uptake among SMTHEs has been low . Yet researchers have hardly researched into the factors that influence insurance uptake among SMTHEs . Two hundred and fifty respondents were selected using a multi stage sampling technique . Confirmatory factor analysis multivariate logit and probit regression techniques were used to determine factors underlying SMTHEs insurance uptake . Risk concerns the firm s characteristics the perceived benefits of insurance and other informal risk coping mechanisms as well as insurance service provision concerns were identified as determinants of insurance uptake . This is one of the first papers to offer a holistic understanding of the factors influencing SMTHEs insurance subscription in a resource scarce destination of Sub Saharan Africa . The practical and theoretical implications of the paper are discussed .
1362,This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of information technology in the hotel industry specifically in Morocco a developing country . Our research model incorporates the following four constructs organizational characteristics individual characteristics perceived benefits and external factors . For this aim a questionnaire was developed and sent to the general managers of hotels in Morocco to collect data and verify the research hypotheses . A sample size of 233 hotels and riads was used . The hypotheses were tested using a partial least squares approach . The results of the analysis reveal that external factors have the strongest effects on the adoption of IT the individual characteristics and the benefits that hotel managers perceive they will get from IT adoption are also important while the organizational characteristics have no significant impact . The theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed .
1363,The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between justice perceptions of hotel employees in international hotels and work related variables such as organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviours . The hypotheses were examined by collecting data from over 200 employees currently working for eight international upscale hotels located in the Canary Islands during the economic crisis period with a high unemployment level . This paper proposes multiple dimensions of employee justice organizational commitment and citizenship behaviours which allows for identifying the relative importance of justice concepts to explain various aspects of organizational outcomes . While distributive justice and interactional justice have positive influences on continuous and affective commitments only distributive justice leads to normative commitment . Continuous commitment is a specific type which positively influences all three types of organizational citizenship behaviours . The discussion sections indicate theoretical and practical implications of the findings .
1364,The purpose of this study is threefold to develop a destination image scale for mixed images destinations to investigate its impact on destination loyalty between first time and repeat tourists and to explore the moderating role of tourist s travel experiences in the relationship between destination image and destination loyalty . Data were collected based on a quota sample from 400 international tourists in Egypt and were analyzed using exploratory factor analyses confirmatory factor analysis structural equation modeling and multi group analysis . The results show that the proposed destination image scale has good reliability validity and predictability . It also supports the argument that tourists cognitive and affective evaluations of the destination have significant effects on destinations overall image . Additionally while all destination image components have a significant impact on destination loyalty those effects are significantly higher for repeat tourists than for first time tourists . Finally the study highlighted many practical implications for tourism marketers .
1365,More people are choosing to include their pets and companion animals in their holidays but provision for and understanding of nonhuman travellers remain limited . Multispecies tourism provides opportunity for the creation of rich personally meaningful experiences that are key to satisfaction but also has potential for producing stress and disappointment . The limited field of multispecies tourism tends to focus on dogs whereas this paper considers some of the different issues raised when humans and horses holiday together . Auto ethnographic vignettes of human horse partnerships on holiday are used to consider questions of interspecies trust and relationships as enacted through tourism and to reflect on some of the complexities and contradictions inherent in these practices . These tourism activities prompt consideration of what makes a good holiday and for whom as well as some of the power relations inherent in multispecies tourism .
1366,Most of our travel experiences are stored recorded and relived in the form of stories tourist blogs have emerged as a modern form of travel story . These stories provide information about exciting moments and memorable events which are usually emotional highpoints that can be useful for tourism marketers . Based on the sociological concept of storytelling this study investigates which aspects of the slow adventure experience travelers present in their travel blogs through a rubric elaborated on extant literature . The findings reveal three types of slow adventure stories and each type of story relates to a different identity construction . The article concludes with a discussion of its theoretical contributions in terms of adding to the literature of adventure tourism and storytelling . In revealing the themes and identities relating to specific slow adventure experiences it provides potential practical implications of travel blogs for slow adventure product designers and marketers .

1369,Destination management processes continue to undergo substantial change and managers now need to demonstrate a social presence and balance the interests of businesses host communities and a wide range of other stakeholders . Advocacy and community leadership have become increasingly important but little is known about the implementation of these functions within destination management . The aim of this paper is to explore how advocacy and community leadership feature in destination management and how they interrelate with other destination management functions . Empirical data were gathered through a series of in depth interviews amongst destination management practitioners in Estonia . The study advances our understanding of how practitioners conceptualise and enact advocacy and community leadership in destination management . A framework for advocacy and community leadership within destination management is proposed to depict the interdependencies with other destination management functions .
1370,Blue Flag is one of the most renowned tourism ecolabels in the world . Although this ecolabel is based primarily on environmental education and management it is argued that its core strength is the capacity to trigger political will . This paper presents the BF implementation process in a country through application of a BF Readiness Matrix and interviews with key stakeholders in eight coastal municipalities in Colombia . The matrix used 87 items to assess the level of compliance of 12 beaches with each of the 33 BF criteria . The challenges faced in the implementation of BF are presented and discussed . Because they are not unique to Colombia the results and conclusions are applicable to many low and middle income countries that historically have not committed to the management of tourist beaches . The conclusions underline the capacity of BF to raise political will to support beach management and generate specific management actions .
1371,Due to fast paced developments in the technological sphere we witness robots becoming commonplace in hospitality . While research has focused on technical and functional aspects of robots the ways in which robots could become effective members of human service teams are less understood . By taking a human robot interaction lens this study investigates the impact of integrating non human service providers into human teams with a focus on trust . A qualitative focus group approach with the LEGO Serious Play method is employed to open novel avenues in tourism research and to build visualise and distil what human robot interaction in hospitality frontline teams could look like . The study s contribution is a conceptual framework that reveals three dominant factors of trust and their sub dimensions necessary for successful future human robot interaction in frontline teams in tourism hospitality and the wider service sector .

1374,Tourists are essential to a destination s social and economic recovery following disaster reducing future risk and enhancing resilience . Drawing on the results of visitor surveys in Kaikura New Zealand we analyse visitors experiences and their consideration of natural hazard risk and response abilities in relation to a damaging earthquake in the region in 2016 . Despite widespread national media and significant disruption findings suggest the disaster had very little impact on visitors perceptions and experiences and did not translate into greater preparedness . Instead tourists reported only limited knowledge about what to do or where to go in the event of a natural hazard event . Results suggest tourists resilience and Kaikura s resilience as a whole would be enhanced by improving knowledge sharing and awareness building . Furthermore by considering tourists as part of a linked social ecological system targeted interventions to improve understanding of natural hazards can support long term recovery trajectories and minimize future losses .

The findings confirm HWebSQ to be a valid and reliable measure of hotel website service quality containing 34 items with 7 dimensions . These include website functionality website design response time ease of use information quality interactivity and security . Each of these dimensions is positively associated with customer purchase intention . The newly developed HWebSQ scale would be valuable to managers of hotels and other accommodation services who are interested in designing and managing websites aimed at attracting and retaining customers .
1377,Quality in cultural heritage attractions is mainly approached from the visitors satisfaction perspective and the literature does not contain a clear definition of quality in the management of cultural heritage sites open to the public . The present study aims to reframe this trend . By way of theoretical contribution we propose a definition of quality in cultural heritage attractions management based on dimensions such as the capacity of preserving the cultural assets the ability to communicate effectively their significance the quality of commodification for visitor use and the ability to boost intercultural competence and promote intercultural dialogue . Based on the above an empirical qualitative study was conducted on the cultural heritage managers current perceptions of quality . The results suggest that a profound asymmetry exists among practitioners opinions and practices and four types of cultural heritage managers were defined with regard to their perception of quality Reactionary Reticent Pragmatic Enthusiastic .
1378,Since the publication of the Experience Economy work by Pine and Gilmore in 1999 understanding the increasing complexity of the customer experience within the customer journey in the tourism industry is a priority for researchers and destination management organizations . This study contributes to the extension of the Experience Economy in tourism research by examining the links between tourists assessment of destination attributes their perceived quality of the service experience and loyalty in seven emerging Mediterranean destinations . To date little research has explored the aforementioned aspects even though the Mediterranean region is the leading tourism destination in the world . With a sample of 1365 Mediterranean tourists the analysis reveals differences between tourists perceptions in Northern and Southern Mediterranean destinations . In addition empirical support to the proposed model proves the direct impact of both variables on loyalty . The study outlines implications to both practitioners and researchers .
1379,The objective of this study is to examine the management strategies for archaeological heritage sites and to identify optimal managerial strategies for such sites . The study is primarily qualitative in nature and consists of two main stages a development of a conceptual framework based on measures for site evaluation 2 application of the methodology to four case studies . The findings indicate that in addition to the realms of Environment and Economy heritage sites have three other significant realms that are relevant to archaeological sites Values and Culture Organization and Legislation and Society and Community . These three realms were found to hold significance for the long term management of archaeological tourism although they are currently under developed in the four case studies investigated . The study also proposes a model called the Sustainability Index for Archaeological Sites which can serve as a basis for operative decisions in the management process .
1380,Consumers performing the role of value creators in experience co creation introduces idiosyncrasies that challenge experiential consistency . Taking pop up dining events as its empirical focus and drawing on semi structured interviews with participants this study examines how organisations and consumers interact to negotiate ambiguity variability and consistency . The paper questions how organisers try to prescribe normative rules governing events . It considers how consumers invest in preparing for events and engage in socialised performances to create unique experiences . The data are also used to show how peer surveillance shapes consumer expectations behaviours and interpretations . Consequently this study contributes to knowledge on the practical management of co creation by conceptualising different pathways through which organisations and consumers attempt to orchestrate behaviours . Moreover in theorising from the data this paper distinguishes between direct and indirect modes of inducement used to achieve experiential outcomes identifying how value signalling practices engage event stakeholders and shape their co creation .
1381,The timelines of planning theory and the approaches to tourism planning are compared from the early twentieth century to the present . The researchers address two specific questions what are the links between these two timelines and what are the contributions to tourism planning knowledge Unlike general planning theory a distinctive business and profitability ethos influenced foundation tourism approaches until the impacts of the sector prompted attention to the need for more stakeholder communication and attention to sustainability concerns . Now communication based planning and sustainability imperatives tend to co exist in both domains with strong roles for stakeholder involvement and compartmentalized plans in tourism . Disciplinary contributions from geography and politics are more marked in general planning theory while business and marketing orientations infuse the tourism perspectives . Tourism planning knowledge is usefully contextualized and advanced by considering generic planning theory but remains very substantially influenced by tourism industry issues and shocks .
1382,The COVID 19 outbreak has changed rapidly the business operation and travel behavior of global communities and calls for research on resilience . This study aims to identify the changing destination image of Thailand as a MICE destination during crises and examine the resilience of Thai MICE stakeholders . A mixed method of qualitative and quantitative design was employed using interviews observations and questionnaire surveys . A longitudinal study of Thai MICE stakeholders during 14 years revealed that the Buddhist concepts of resilience and Thainess contribute to psychological resilience . Buddhism and Thainess cultivate the concept of crisis concierge . Surveys showed unchanged image of exhibition facilities during the political instability . Thailand s incentive travel benefits from the availability of bleisure attractions . Good value for money Thai hospitality bleisure attractions and international standard venues are key resilient factors .
1383,This study examines tourists dietary behavioral changes associated with how they are concerned with self presentation . A within subject mediation analysis reveals that tourists self presentational concerns can influence their diet regulations . Such concerns tend to be lower in the destination environment than in the familiar home setting . Thus tourists at their destinations engage less frequently in diet regulations for self presentational purposes . Key findings suggest that although the effects of tourism on health are multifaceted the products and services offered by hospitality organizations and businesses in the tourism system may negatively affect tourists health owing to the relief of diet regulation and other health related self presentational concerns that are strongly present at home .
1384,Holiday camping and time spent in outdoor environments are critical childhood experiences . This study aims to identify the outcomes and processes underlying children s experiences of holiday camping . The researchers use the contextual model of learning as the theoretical background underpinning the study . Chinese children who left their families and participated in structured camping trips formed as the research respondents . Several child centred research methods including participant observation focus group discussions and interviews based on elicited drawings were employed to study the children s construction of their experiences . Children mainly reported positive camping outcomes including enhanced interpersonal skills improved self awareness general knowledge and skills and positive emotions . Negative outcomes including feelings of anxiety and boredom were also occasionally observed . The ongoing interplay of personal social and physical contexts works together to generate these camping outcomes . Practical and theoretical implications are offered to enhance positive outcomes and reduce negative ones when children go camping .
1385,This research explored the relationship between environmental stimuli and tourist experiences by considering the mediating impact of arousal level . Designed around the arousal theory of environmental psychology this framework suggests that novel environmental stimuli create optimal arousal levels and lead to optimal performance . An on site survey was distributed to tourists at Hu Li Shan Fortress in Xiamen Fujian Province China which is a smart tourism destination recognized by the Chinese government . Completed self administered questionnaires were obtained from 372 respondents who had used the smart facilities . The findings through the SEM method revealed that physical and psychological stimuli had positive effects on arousal levels and tourist experiences and arousal level was a moderator between environmental stimuli and tourist experiences . Thus destinations should offer optimal environmental stimuli to tourists by increasing smart facilities and services and continuously updating them .
1386,This paper investigates the relationship between entrepreneurship strategies and industry growth . Drawing on a longitudinal database of 481 tourism strategic planning documents a sampling framework is used to map tourism strategies tourism entrepreneurship strategies and tourism entrepreneurship strategic themes to tourism region by year as well as to compile corresponding tourism jobs and visitation growth data . Exploratory bibliometric visuals and logistic regression reveal that regions with a tourism strategy and targeted strategies to support entrepreneurs predict tourism growth specifically strategies for human capital development and tourism incubation programs . Future research should focus on the efficacy of tourism incubation programs for stimulating entrepreneurial activity in regional areas and as a mechanism to stimulate recovery from global crises .
1387,This study explores and tests a comprehensive model of co creation in creating value and tourist satisfaction . In addition to being the first study to empirically test the customer value co creation behavior scale developed by
1388,Data provided by tourists always benefit tourism managers and help them offer customized services products and destinations to future travelers . This research investigates the effect of interests on Iranian outbound tourists especially their selection of a destination and then using text and data mining algorithms it introduces a model to predict tourists destinations based on their interests and travel backgrounds . In the current study a dataset of 244 980 travels consisting of 6661 people was extracted from social media to discover the relationship between tourists interests and travel destinations . Hence it represents a model that is created using data and text mining from travel agencies to design their marketing plans by offering and advertising destinations to travelers with specific interest categories . The model has also shown promising accuracy and interesting results for the future tourist destination data and text analysis .
1389,This study analyzes the relationship between news information and the occupational stigma experienced by tour guides using the Stereotype Content Model and Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes maps . Three experiments were conducted to test the research hypotheses . The empirical results indicated that in competence news information positive valence news information can significantly reduce the public s perception of tour guide occupational stigma . Furthermore the competence stereotype plays a partially mediating role in the influence of the competence news information valence on TGOS perception . Moreover contrary to news information from commercial organizations and personal web media that coming from the government reducesrather than promotesthe public s perception of occupational competence and warmth leading to more severe TGOS . This study fills the research gap regarding stigma in tourism and offers suggestions to solve problems related to OS in other industries .
1390,Resilience is increasingly recognized as a means of reducing the effects of disasters on tourist destinations . However there is limited understanding of the contextual factors that promote resilient attitudes and behaviors among employees of tourism and hospitality organizations which in turn lead to business recovery and success . Using a capital based approach this study explores the impact of employees resilience as manifested by hardiness resourcefulness and optimism on two indicators of business continuity perception of job insecurity and creative performance . The mediating effects of distributive justice and trust in the organization are also tested to establish how they affect this relationship . Data were gathered from 960 employees in tourism and hospitality organizations affected by terrorist attacks in Egypt . Using results obtained through structural equation modeling we demonstrate a direct relationship between employees resilience and business continuity with distributive justice and trust partially functioning as mediators . The implications and limitations are discussed .
1391,This study examines the effect of training satisfaction and weather on the intention to revisit a sport event . It considers attribute non attendance i.e . respondents ignoring choice attributes in surveys . Online surveys were conducted at four sport events in the United States in 2017 and 2018 . Respondents answered a series of hypothetical scenarios for return visitation that randomly assigned different travel costs per mile travel distances weather forecasts and respondents training satisfaction . Logit models estimated with and without attribute non attendance reveal the extent to which respondents did not pay attention to specific trip attributes when answering the survey . These results indicate that attribute non attendance is an issue in each data set . Partial consideration of attribute non attendance yields statistically significant willingness to pay estimates for event attributes while full consideration yields larger willingness to pay estimates . This study s contribution lies in the examination of previously neglected factors and the consideration of attribute non attendance .
1392,The aim of this study is twofold to explore whether board characteristics lead to greater corporate social responsibility performance and to test whether CSR performance enhances firms financial performance in the hospitality and tourism industry . Data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the H T firms listed there between 2011 and 2018 . We employed panel data analysis after which we ran robustness tests . The results indicated that having a CSR committee and female directors on the board are robust factors driving firms to show superior CSR performance in all dimensions including environmental social and governance . Independent directors and directors diligence selectively enhance the overall CSR score and individual pillars of CSR . Investigating the relationship between CSR performance and firms financial performance did not produce a significant outcome . The findings propose a straightforward roadmap for H T firms and policymakers to identify characteristics of CSR friendly boards .
1393,Utilizing a scientometric review of global trends and structure from 388 bibliographic records over two decades this study seeks to advance the building of comprehensive knowledge maps that draw upon global travel demand studies .

This research provides meaningful guidance for researchers operators and decision makers who wish to improve the accuracy of tourism demand forecasting .
1394,National culture can affect consumer behaviour but there is limited empirical evidence to establish the exact magnitude of this effect in particular consumption contexts and in specific consumption markets . This paper contributes to knowledge by exploring and comparing the extent to which national culture may contribute to pro environmental behaviour of tourists in the UK and China . By drawing upon the five dimensions or values of national culture proposed by Hofstede Schwartz and Trompenaars and Hampden Turner and by applying the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling the study establishes the causal relationships between the cultural backgrounds of tourists their environmental knowledge pro environmental attitudes and pro environmental behavioural intentions . The implications for policy making management and future research are discussed .
1395,The U.S. tourism and hospitality workforce is disproportionately represented by immigrants and minorities particularly in low wage jobs with adverse work conditions . Immigrant hotel and foodservice workers face excess chronic stress and related syndemic risks exacerbated by social political and economic inequities . COVID 19 has suddenly intensified the stressful and already difficult circumstances of immigrant service sector workers . The travel and tourism sector is one of the hardest hit due to widespread travel restrictions and shelter in place orders designed to curb infection spread . Restrictions and lockdowns have devastated tourism dependent destinations and displaced millions of vulnerable workers causing them to lose their livelihoods . Compared to the general workforce a sizeable increase in occupational stress has already been observed in the hospitality tourism sector over the past 1520years . COVID 19 and related fears add further strains on immigrant hotel and foodservice workers potentially exerting a significant toll on mental and physical health and safety .
1396,This study attempts to find the underlying dimensionality in online reviews of fine dining ethnic food restaurant experiences in Hong Kong . This research adopted semantic network analysis with ClausetNewmanMoore clustering . Consequently diverse and specific dimensionality was explored in this research including ambiance service food drinks desserts view location occasions reputation and price . The content of the reviews on five types of ethnic restaurants was different in some dimensions . Marketers of fine dining ethnic restaurants can select a particular focus when they promote their restaurants develop menu plan and train staff members . This study implies that the quality dimensions of traditional restaurants may not accurately represent the factual dimensions thereby resulting in implications for developing a new index of restaurant quality .
1397,Halal tourism is a dynamic emerging market segment that is growing at a notable pace . Understanding the Muslim travelers needs interests and behaviors is a key priority for professionals . Therefore the goals of this study are twofold first to examine the linear and nonlinear effects of Islamic physical and nonphysical hotel attributes on Muslim guests visit intention and willingness to pay extra and second to employ an advanced segmentation method for revealing different types of Muslim travelers . Data were randomly collected from 559 Muslim in the United Arab Emirates . The study adopted the finite mixtures partial least squares technique to investigate the question of unobserved heterogeneity among Muslim travelers . The study results reveal important linear and nonlinear relationships and three new Muslim segments . The segment specific findings offer distinctive insights for managers policy makers and decision makers in developing long term strategies for tapping into the Muslim travel market .
1398,It has been suggested that the tourism sector is one in which temporary and low skilled jobs abound . The aim of this study is to analyze the educational and experience requirements associated with job offers in tourism and their corresponding contracts and salaries . Nine thousand job advertisements were analyzed from one of the biggest employment websites in Spain . Online job offers allow a profile of employers preferences to be drawn up in terms of occupations educational levels and required experience as well as the terms of contracts and salaries offered . Internal heterogeneity in the tourism sector arising from the coexistence of different functions and skills is highlighted . Our analysis shows that the occupation crucially conditions salary differences and contract types in tourism job offers .
1399,In recent years marketing managers have realized that online reviews are an essential element in customer decision making . However there has been little valid measure of online reviews and no systematic analysis of their effect on consumer purchase intention . Drawing on the uses and gratification and consumer culture theories this study develops a valid measure of online reviews and analyzes their effect on purchase intention . With a sample of 1112 hotel customers from three countries this study validates the positive effect of online reviews on purchase intention through the perceived effectiveness of social media platforms and online trust while confirming the moderating role of cosmopolitanism .
1400,This article purports to explore the impact of the four types of experiences education entertainment escapism and aesthetics proposed by
1401,The application of price hedonic theory in the hotel pricing domain has relatively ignored the destination and country level differences . We compare hotel rents across tourist and non tourist destinations for an emerging and a developed market . Utilizing multiple regression on a combined dataset of 21 904 data points spread over 2458 unique hotels we show that the nature of destination and market moderates the association between hotel attributes and rents . Further the results show that hotels at tourist destinations enjoy a rent premium across markets . However this rent premium is positively associated with star rating only in emerging markets and is stable in developed markets . We contribute to price hedonic theory by proposing destination and market variables as moderators . Globalization and industry concentration make location decisions recurring and flexible . The study aims to help hotel managers by providing a contextual framework for making these strategic investment decisions .
1402,This study applies brand tourism effect to examine the loyal customers different attitudinal responses caused by two types of non loyal customers in the luxury hotel industry . The study also investigates the moderating role of psychological ownership on brand tourism effect . Conducting a 2 2 experimental design the results show that the loyal customers perceive brand tourists more favorably and their disappointment is the most significantly different emotional response . In addition the result also finds the moderating effect to be significant indicating that in a lounge loyal customers view brand tourists more positively than in restaurant . Lastly the study also discusses theoretical and practical implications .
1403,is one of the most important urban parks in Ecuador . It is a recreational and ecological park that combines history trade culture and entertainment . It is the most iconic and active hub for economic and touristic activities in the city of Guayaquil .

1404,Arts led revitalization projects are increasingly being undertaken in South Korean cities to improve residential areas in decline . One of the more common initiatives involves the beautification of residential neighbourhoods through mural art . Seoul s Ihwa Mural Village is one of the most representative examples of the murals based regeneration trend . The residential area s transformation by artists in 2006 has made it one of the most popular murals tourism destinations albeit to the displeasure of a segment of the local population . In 2016 two of Ihwa Village s most iconic murals were destroyed by several residents . This paper explores the context behind the incident through in depth interviews with key stakeholders . Our research reveals that the Ihwa mural incident was not simply a local reaction to overtourism but also a response to the perceived unequal economic benefits accruing from the murals tourism . We offer recommendations for policy makers considering similar revitalization projects in residential neighbourhoods .
1405,This paper aims to contribute to the knowledge on how the Smart Tourism Destination might enhance the Tourist Shopping Journey through offering information sources that meet visitors needs and preferences . The CAN model was employed to explore the antecedents of using information sources for purchases made in destinations . The importance of the cognitive variables performance and effort expectancy in the purchasing process are highlighted tourists are pragmatic when consulting information sources in destinations . This study contributes to the knowledge of the role of information sources in TSJ behaviour and can help managers in the development of STD strategies and services . It also opens new research lines by considering the TSJ as a hitherto unexamined holistic process .
1406,This study investigates the influence of visitors place attachment and emotional experience on destination loyalty . Furthermore religious affiliation was examined as a moderator within the model . Survey data from Attur Feast attendees were analysed using a series of multiple regression analyses to test proposed hypotheses . Visitors emotional experiences were found to mediate the effect of place attachment dimensions on loyalty . Additionally visitors religious affiliation was found to moderate place attachment and emotional experience effects on destination loyalty . Furthermore visitors religious affiliation moderates only the indirect effect of place dependence on destination loyalty via emotional experience and this effect was strongest for Christian visitors compared to Hindu or Muslim visitors . In sum we found that perceived emotional experiences mediate the relationship between place attachment and destination loyalty . Implications limitations and directions for future research are offered .
1407,This paper explores employees perceptions regarding the inconsistent images of luxury hotels . Based on individual interviews with 16 employees 4 managers and 2 hospitality experts from Pakistan the study found that five star hotels employees experienced wide inconsistencies between their organizations external hotel image and internal employer image . This external internal image inconsistency not only played a major role in forming employees perceptions towards the attractiveness of their organizations as an employer but also influenced their organizational attachment levels and recommendation behaviors . The paper also explores different ways through which employees deal with these perceived inconsistencies . Three distinct employee clusters were identified as employees adopted different strategies to deal with these inconsistencies based on their inclination towards either or both of the external and internal image . Practical implications in terms of hotel branding and talent management are discussed .
1408,This study aims to examine the effect of acculturation strategies on managers person environment fit and hiring decisions . An experimental research design was employed within whose context four conditions were created and fictitious job interview record forms of applicants were presented to hotel managers in Turkey . The findings revealed that the separated Syrian applicant was evaluated to have a lower P E fit . Furthermore the separated Syrian applicant has a lower employability score than the other applicants and is less preferred for the vacancy in point . Theoretically the current research expands the current literature by revealing that acculturation preferences impact managers assessments of P E fit and their hiring decisions . In practice this study highlights the importance of cultural awareness and intercultural skills for managers and the need to implement rigorous assessment tools .
1409,Tourism whilst delivering economic benefits can deliver environmental harm . Although several measures to mitigate tourism s environmental effects have been documented a shared responsibility that encompasses the tourism industry and tourists themselves is needed to limit environmental damage . This paper demonstrates how social marketing can be applied to gain insights that can be used by the tourism industry to promote pro environmental behaviours of targeted tourists to contribute positively to the environment . Social benchmarks that were applied resulted in the identification of two segments one of which was examined in more detail using a follow up interview format to gain insights for intervention planning design and implementation . Implications for the role that tourism may play in delivering changes that benefit our planet are outlined and opportunities for future research are provided .

1414,This study examines experiential loyalty in the context of local food consumption by domestic leisure tourists . A conceptual framework is developed to understand factors which increase tourists propensity to exhibit experiential loyalty . Relationships between independent factors and the dependent variable of experiential loyalty are examined using a binary logistic regression model . The centrality of local food to tourists is the most important factor in increasing experiential loyalty although cultural motivation and satisfaction are also predictors . The results provide insights for government and private tourism enterprises with practical recommendations outlined .
1415,Although cultural tourists increasingly seek to experience cultural events actively and to directly engage in creative activities empirical knowledge about the creative tourist remains limited . This study aims to characterize the motivations and profile of creative tourists . The data was collected through a survey of participants in creative tourism activities in Portugal developed by 40 pilot institutions of the CREATOUR project during 2017 and 2018 with 814 usable questionnaires collected and validated . The questionnaire had 30 questions and marked the first time this kind of research was conducted in Portugal . The questionnaire included questions on the composition of their travel companions their previous participation in a creative tourism experience reasons for visiting the destination their characterization of the creative tourism experience an evaluation of their creative tourism experience and their socio demographic profile . Using a cluster analysis to analyse the data three clusters were found Novelty Seekers Knowledge and Skills Learners and Leisure Creative Seekers .
1416,The tourism industry faces multiple changes . Because of this vulnerability as evidenced by the COVID 19 pandemic the study of hotel resilience is a key issue for the survival and competitiveness of organisations and destinations . Therefore this paper proposes a holistic model to measure organisational resilience . To that end it aims to analyse the determinants of organisational resilience i.e . predictors of resilience and to assess how they contribute to hotel resilience and performance . Firstly the hotel context in the Canary Islands is examined to identify the level of impact frequency and predictability of each type of change . Secondly scales development and validation were conducted . Finally the proposed model is validated . Findings confirm that the strategy and change dimensions have a considerable effect on hotel resilience which positively influences hotel performance . Discussion provides hotel managers with guidelines to improve organisational resilience and performance .
1417,Customer to customer interaction constraints are key points in services management . The topic has been studied in the tourism field but remains under researched in a pilgrimage context . This paper discusses conflicts in pilgrim to pilgrim interaction along the path to sacred places and in the connected tourist and hospitality services that emerge from the heterogeneity of motivations to go on pilgrimage . An ethnographic research on the Way of Saint James was conducted . The researchers walked alongside with pilgrims driven by different motivations and experienced situations of interaction among them . This study suggests that interactions of purist with non purist pilgrims may result in conflicts discomfort and judgement due to differences in experiencing the pilgrimage . This paper discusses the challenges faced and provides recommendations for hospitality managers operating in pilgrimage areas to address different needs and expectations and thus minimise conflict prone interactions .
1418,This study investigates the factors influencing food experiences perceived by food tourists in the context of a food museum and its associated restaurant . A qualitative exploratory approach was employed using Chinese tourists visiting Hangzhou Cuisine Museum in Zhejiang province . This research finds that food tourists look for knowledge accumulation and gastronomic experiences when visiting a food museum and restaurant complex and each experience is formed by both tourist and setting factors . The findings highlight the significant and more complex engagement of setting factors in the museum restaurants . The institutionalised characteristics of museums are equally expected within the in house restaurants and social trust in the museum along with external factors that verify authentic representation of the museum contributed to the perceived authenticity of the food tourist s dining experience . This paper discusses broad implications for food experience design at food museums and restaurants as emerging tourism attractions .
1419,Renowned worldwide for its nightlife Ibiza has been diversifying its portfolio of tourism products by actively committing to sports tourism .

This study explores human robot interaction in the context of tourists interacting with hotel service robots . The data 7994 online TripAdvisor reviews of 74 hotels were subjected to a content analysis based on the Service Robot Acceptance Model and its dimensions . A sentiment analysis was also carried out . The results identify the principal dimensions and variables involved in HRI and the feelings robots inspire in different types of travellers . Guests most often comment on the functional dimension . Robots functions determine this experience and influence the interaction between robots and hotel guests .
1421,Tourist arrivals and tourism revenues have been extensively studied to evaluate international tourist flows whereas the structure and evolution of these flows have received less attention . Based on international tourist arrival data from 221 countries regions during the period 19952018 this study applies network analysis to explore the structure and evolution of international tourist flows and the roles and functions of countries regions in the international tourist flow network . The results of this study reveal that the network density of international tourist flows is increasing . Countries regions in Europe East Asia and North America generally occupy a significantly important position within the international tourist flow network especially Germany and China . Those geographically close countries regions demonstrate the same or similar roles and positions in international tourism . This study has significant implications for tourist destination management and marketing .
1422,The principal aim of this paper is to establish a Spa Assessment Model to help assess the current use and tourism potential of spas as tourism products as well as for determining spa visitor preferences . This was achieved through the inclusion of tourism experts who assisted in choosing the subindicators for the model and with the help of visitors who gave their opinion about the importance of each subindicator through a survey . Afterwards this data was analyzed and compared between two market segments in order to reveal their preferences . Results indicate the main differences between two market segments and reveal their preferences which further enables the spa management to create a tailor made product best suited to a certain market segment .
1423,There is currently limited knowledge concerning the economic value of commercial whale watching from the perspective of the consumer s trip experience . This study outlines the results of an in person contingent valuation survey which asked whale watching tourists in Faxafli Bay Iceland how much they would have been willing to pay beyond the paid ticket price . Based on a sample of 163 tourists only 30 reported any consumer surplus despite the majority stating positive satisfaction with the experience . Mean consumer surplus was 768 ISK . Scaled up to the number of whale watching tourists in Faxafli Bay in 2018 of 148 442 aggregate CS was approximately 114.0 million ISK a 6.9 mark up on estimated annual revenue generation derived from average ticket prices . The study provides new information on the economic value of whale watching in an area which had already been part designated as a whale sanctuary .
1424,Firms with high brand equity often employ the strategy of brand extension to place new products on the market . Very few studies have analyzed brand extensions in the cultural heritage context and fewer still have dealt with brands carrying the World Heritage hallmark . This work contributes to the existing knowledge in this field by examining how cultural heritage brand preference contributes to the formation of brand extension loyalty taking into account the tourists perceptions of the extension and the moderating role of brand extension fit and authenticity . A 2 x 3 between subjects experimental design was used . The results show that parent brand preference exerts a positive effect on brand extension loyalty mediated by brand extension attitude and brand extension image . These relationships are moderated by brand extension fit .
1425,Although postcolonial analyses examining the sexualized imagery of women in tourism have been conducted previous studies have predominantly focused on gender and colonialism from a patriarchal perspective . By doing so other colonial power asymmetries such as race class and ethnicity have often been neglected . This paper mobilises postcolonial feminist theory to expand the existing analyses and discourses concerning gendered representations in tourism . Through a narrative analysis of the images published in the official Instagram page of Sri Lanka s Ministry of Tourism we contend that the images produced and circulated to promote Sri Lanka in many instances echo essentialist gendered binaries . However as the images tend to produce and reiterate Sri Lankan national identity through a hegemonic Sinhalese Buddhist discourse they also show the intersections between gender and other asymmetries of power in reproducing colonial gendered identities .
1426,Value co destruction has received widespread attention from the tourism academic community . This article uses the employees and customers of tourism service providers as the main research objects and employs interviews and questionnaires to develop an employee customer perspective measurement scale of value co destruction behavior in tourism . The reliability analysis exploratory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model testing results show that the measurement scale of value co destruction behavior in tourism consists of 5 dimensions and a total of 29 items with high reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity which can be used to evaluate the extent to which a subject abuses his or her own resources or the resources of others in tourism interactions resulting in tourism value reduction or destruction . Finally the research results and future research are discussed .
1427,This paper aims to examine the role of economic policy uncertainty on tourism investments across the samples of OECD non OECD high income upper middle income and low income economies . We account for cross sectional dependence and endogeneity and also incorporate economic development financial development and trade openness indicators in the analyses . By using annual data between 1996 and 2016 and a total of 101 countries we provide robust estimates on the determinants of tourism investments . The findings from the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group and the Group Mean approaches show that the EPU has a significant negative impact on tourism investments across the panels . Moreover other estimates suggest that economic development financial development and trade positively contribute to tourism investments .
1428,Markov model simulation based on the natural history of disease is commonly employed for the comparative research of health interventions . The present study aims to simulate the natural progression of breast cancer and parameterize the initial and transition probabilities of multiple states of breast cancer development among Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer and relapse rate of each clinical stage were collected from China s cancer registry yearbooks and clinical epidemiological studies to simulate the process from full health to breast cancer to death among Chinese women aged 30 to 80 through a Markov cohort study . The validity analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the model estimation . A Markov transition model with 7 states was constructed for Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer estimated by the initial and transition probabilities among different Markov states were highly consistent with the registered data and observed studies . A breast cancer transition model for Chinese women has been established with validity . It could be a point of reference for further economic evaluations and breast cancer screening policy formulation .
1429,Hypoglycemia is a common acute complication in patients with diabetes and markedly impacts on medical resource use . To make an initial assessment of the incidence of hypoglycemia and the associated utilization of medical resources and medical costs in insulin treated patients with diabetes using medical records from 4 tertiary hospitals in China . A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records from 4 tertiary hospitals in Beijing Henan and Guangzhou from 2012 to 2015 . The targeted patients were those diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and treated with insulin . Diabetes was identified with A total of 14 044 patients were treated with insulin . There were 1930 patients who had outpatient visits and 310 patients who had inpatient visits owing to hypoglycemia . Incidences of hypoglycemia were 111.3 events per 100 patient years for outpatient visits and 5.9 events per 100 patient years for inpatient visits . Patients with hypoglycemia had more outpatient visits 8.09 vs 6.22 times year The burden of hypoglycemia especially severe hypoglycemia is substantial and associated with increased use of medical resources and expenditures among the target population which serves as a vital first glance at patients with insulin treated diabetes in China overall .
1430,Indonesias social health insurance . The 2013 national procurement price was compared with the 2017 e catalogue price . The hospitals procurement prices were collected from the data 3 years before and 3 years under Indonesias social health insurance JKN and the data were used to assess the medicine procurement prices in real conditions . The outcome measure was the difference in procurement prices before and under the JKN . The results showed that the procurement prices of 429 of 539 medicines listed in the 2017 e catalogue decreased of which 210 items showed over a 50 decrease . Nevertheless the procurement prices of 104 items increased especially those that were still under patent or those with a few brands registered in Indonesia . The procurement prices in public and private hospitals showed a similar trend that is a significant decrease . Interestingly none catalogue medicine prices also decreased quite steeply although the prices of the branded generic category in the private hospital remained unchanged . The pharmaceutical policies under the JKN implementation had a profound impact on decreasing medicine procurement prices in Indonesia .
1431,Medical examination of the adult population is aimed at diagnosing chronic noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors . The unreasonable choice of screening methods and information processing can lead to the unjustified waste of resources with little benefit or even damage to the health of population and to the distortion of the statistic information . To evaluate the quality of medical examinations for chronic noncommunicable diseases among the adult population of the Irkutsk region from 2013 to2017 . We analyzed the Adult Clinical Examination report N 131 using comparative and statistical methods . It was selected for this study because it provides a summary of the findings from the Chronic Non Communicable Diseases surveys from 2013 to 2017 and thus precluded unnecessary investment of time and labor . The report comprises sections 1000 to 7000 which provided medical examination data such as demographic information and statistics on various diseases including neoplasms . The years 2016 and 2017 were notable for the emergence of 567 new cancers which accounted for 12.9 of total diagnoses . In 2017 there were 115 192 patients with cardiovascular diseases a fivefold increase from 2013 . Among the neurological dysfunctions 0.9 were ischemia attacks and related syndromes . The remaining 99.1 were not highlighted in the report . The respiratory system diseases were pneumonia bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma asthmatic status and bronchiectasis . These diseases made up 68.3 of all pathologies of the respiratory system . The remaining 11 327 cases were not classified nosologically . Every section of the N 131 report showed significant inconsistencies among the summary survey results for both the Irkutsk Region and Russia . This could result in a misunderstanding of disease prevalence and consequently in improper decision making . At this point approaches to statistical analysis of health surveys must be reconsidered on a national scale .
1432,There has been continuous development in the field of health technology assessment owing to the added value of HTA in supporting healthcare reimbursement decisions . Collaboration and engagement among countries in Asia has been carried out to share experiences and learning on the barriers and factors facilitating the implementation and use of HTA in policy making . A symposium on the topic of
1433,Candidemia or invasive candidiasis is an increasingly common fungal infection and has been associated with high mortality particularly among the immunocompromised and critically ill . Although several studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of managing candidemia and IC quality assessment on the methodological aspects of these cost studies was not performed . To date no systematic review focusing on the economic burden of candidemia and IC has ever been conducted . The aim of this study was to systematically review the available evidence on the economic burden of candidemia and IC worldwide . Databases were searched through June 2018 . Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the eligible studies . Costs reported in the included studies were converted to 2016 USD using Campbell and Cochrane Economics Methods Group the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information Centre Cost Converter software . Eight articles were included in this systematic review . The mean total cost per patient with candidemia and IC ranged from 48487 to 157574 whereas the mean cost per hospitalization associated with candidemia and IC was from 10216 to 37715 . All studies were from developed Western countries and reported only direct costs of candidemia and IC . Hospitalization was the main cost driver contributing to more than half of the total costs . Quality cost studies on candidemia and IC based on standardized methods to provide informed decision making among healthcare authorities in implementing appropriate strategies is anticipated in particular in developing countries .
1434,Neurologic disorders impose a heavy burden on healthcare in Singapore . To date no data on the willingness to pay for neurologic treatments has been reported in the local population . We aimed to quantify the value of various health domains to neuroscience patients and their caregivers by comparing their WTP for different types of treatments . A questionnaire using a mixed open ended and closed ended contingent valuation method was developed to elicit WTP and self administered by 112 visitors to a neuroscience outpatient clinic . The WTP for treatments in 3 health domains was evaluated and compared . Subgroup regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors . Treatment that improved cosmesis had the highest median WTP of Singapore dollar 35000 followed by treatment that provided 1 year of life extension and 1 year of advanced restored function SGD 10000 This is the first study to provide data on how different health domains are valued by neuroscience patients and caregivers in our population . Respondents valued treatment that restored or improved their physical appearances the most . These findings could contribute to future policies on the improvement of neuroscience care .
1435,Quality adjusted life year is widely applied nowadays which consider both survival and quality of life . When most diseases are becoming chronic it is imperative to quantify the overall health impact of a disease in lifetime perspective . The purpose of this study is to introduce methods for estimating quality adjusted life expectancy and loss of QALE in patients with a disease or specific conditions . The QALE of an index cohort can be represented as the integration of the product of lifetime survival function and mean QoL function . We introduce a robust extrapolation approach for estimating lifetime survival function and propose an approach for estimating lifetime mean QoL function for studies with limited follow up . The best part of the proposed method is that the survival data and QoL data can be collected separately . A cohort of patients with a specific condition can be identified by databases that regularly collect data for the control of diseases and their survival status is verified by linking to a mortality registry . Although nationwide QoL data are not available researchers can implement a relative short term follow up interview on a random sample of patients to collect QoL data . For demonstration we applied the proposed methods to estimate QALE and loss of QALE of oral cancer patients . The estimates of QALE for oral cancer patients were 11.0 and 14.2 quality adjusted life years for men and women respectively . The estimates of loss of QALE for the male and female patients with oral cancer were 14.4 and 7.5 QALYs respectively . The methods for estimating QALE and loss of QALE can be applied to economic evaluation of cancer control including screening .
1436,In November 2017 the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by videoconference under the Better Access initiative to address inequitable access of mental health services across regions in Australia . This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake of videoconference for psychology resulting from the initiative change . Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item codes for videoconference consultations . Activity data from 2 years before and the first year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine the uptake of videoconference for psychology . Data were stratified by allied health profession sex age and state jurisdiction . In the 1 year period after the introduction of reimbursed videoconference consultations approximately 5.7 million in person consultations and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by Medicare in Australia . Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07 of the total consultations performed in that 1 year period and showed an increased trajectory . The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of patients via both in person and videoconference delivery modes . Videoconference mental health services were used in the first year that they were available although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals . This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society .
1437,As populations are growing older the prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing . Meanwhile many new drugs are introduced each year as a result of technological advances . This study uses diabetes as an example to investigate the relative importance of population aging and technological innovation in accounting for the growth of health expenditures . The retrospective cohort study was conducted based on claims data covering 1997 to 2006 taken from Taiwans National Health Insurance . Patients were selected based on whether they received antidiabetic drugs . Growth in health expenditure was decomposed into 3 parts number of patients mean treatment cost and the interaction between the change in the mean treatment cost and the change in the number of patients . The results indicated that 75 of the growth in expenditures for treating diabetic patients is attributable to the effect of population aging as reflected by the increase in the diabetes prevalence rate and disease severity . Technological innovation in the form of treatment substitution and treatment expansion effects accounted for only about 25 of the growth in expenditures for treating diabetic patients . Population aging plays a more significant role than technological innovation in driving up health expenditures for the treatment of diabetic patients . This suggests that population aging may contribute significantly to the future growth of the healthcare sector in Asian countries such as Taiwan .
1438,Health technology assessment has long been employed by many countries around the world but its adoption in Asia has been slower . Only recently have a growing number of Asian countries started to implement HTA for pricing and reimbursement decisions . The objective of this article is to provide an overview of how HTA has been or is being implemented in Asia within the context of a countrys existingand often complexcoverage reimbursement and pricing schemes . Three countries at different stages of HTA implementation were selected as case studies South Korea where there is a young yet established HTA program Japan where a 3 year HTA pilot program has just concluded and China where HTA efforts are underway but have not been formally implemented . Not only do the experiences of these 3 countries well exemplify how the organization and scope of HTA can be customized to meet a countrys unique healthcare needs but they also provide the opportunity to outline some common key challenges that must be overcome to implement and develop HTA competencies and capabilities .
1439,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an innovative and effective treatment in high surgical risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis . This cost effectiveness analysis of transfemoral TAVI compared with surgical aortic valve replacement conforms with the methodological guidelines for cost effectiveness evaluation by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare in Japan . The cost effectiveness of TF TAVI using SAPIEN XT was evaluated using a lifetime Markov simulation from the national payer perspective . Comparators were SAVR for HR patients and standard of care for inoperable patients . A systematic literature review for clinical evidence of TF TAVI and comparators was conducted . The evidence for TF TAVI was derived from the SOURCE XT registry and Japanese post marketing surveillance . Because there was no literature directly or indirectly comparing TF TAVI using SAPIEN XT with comparators the comparator data were selected from relevant published studies considering the similarity of study eligibility criteria and patient backgrounds . Sensitivity analyses were used to validate the robustness of results . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of TF TAVI versus SAVR for HR patients was 1.3 million quality adjusted life years . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of TF TAVI versus SOC for inoperable patients was 3.5 million QALY . TF TAVI was cost effective when compared with SAVR for HR patients and when compared with SOC for inoperable patients using a threshold of 5 million QALY .
1440,There is a growing interest in health technology assessment and economic evaluations in developing countries such as Ethiopia . The objective of this study was to derive an EQ 5D 5L value set from the Ethiopian general population to facilitate cost utility analysis . A nationally representative sample was recruited using a stratified multistage quota sampling technique . Face to face computer assisted interviews using the EuroQol Portable Valuation Technology protocol of composite time trade off In the pilot study the acceptability of the tasks was good and there were no special concerns with undertaking the This is the first EQ 5D 5L valuation study in Africa using international valuation methods
1441,To assess the cost effectiveness of population based abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in Estonia . A Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of population based AAA screening compared with no screening . A hypothetical cohort of 6000 men aged 65 was followed for 35 years . Data for disease transition probabilities and quality of life outcomes were obtained from published literature costs were calculated based on Estonian data . Analysis followed the healthcare payers perspective using an annual discount rate of 5 for costs and effects . The model evaluated the number of avoidable AAA ruptures and AAA related deaths and the differences in costs and quality adjusted life years . The AAA screening would have prevented 10 AAA ruptures and 6 AAA related deaths among the cohort of 6000 men resulting in 23 QALYs gained . The additional cost of the screening and treatment was 39 429 with the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for screening compared with no screening being 17303 per QALY gained . Although results were sensitive to assumptions regarding health related quality of life and the models time horizon screening was found to be cost effective with a 99 probability at a willingness to pay threshold of 30 000 per QALY . Population based AAA screening of elderly men is likely to be a cost effective measure in reducing the AAA related disease burden . Given the increase in the overall costs the actual policy decisions regarding implementing an AAA screening program in Estonia are likely to be influenced by availability of resources as well .
1442,To identify and describe the various economic evaluation studies in Malaysia and to determine the range of incremental cost effectiveness ratios as reported in these studies . A comprehensive search of the scientific electronic databases was conducted to identify all published economic evaluation studies related to Malaysian healthcare . Two researchers assessed the quality of selected studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument . The assessment was also reviewed by expert members of the Technical Advisory Committee of Health Technology Economic Evaluations . A total of 64 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and included in this systematic review . Thirty studies were partial economic evaluations the full economic evaluations included 17 cost effectiveness analyses and 17 cost utility analyses . From all the reported ICERs the majority were categorized as highly cost effective per capita per quality adjusted life years or disability adjusted life years gained . This review identifies information gaps and loopholes in health economics research in Malaysia . Additionally this study provides the information that the majority of published interventions in Malaysia fell within the cost effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP per capita per quality adjusted life years or disability adjusted life years gained .
1443,To determine the cost effectiveness of intensive blood pressure treatment in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease over their lifetime in Saudi Arabia . A Markov model was developed for the BP strategies to estimate the added lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years gained . These 2 items were then used to develop an incremental cost effectiveness ratio . Event rates were estimated from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and the other model inputs were retrieved from previous studies . Estimated costs were collected from 5 private hospitals in Riyadh Saudi Arabia . The model used a lifetime framework adopting healthcare payer in Saudi Arabia . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using 1 way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness and uncertainty of the estimates . Over a 30 year period intensive BP therapy would be cost effective compared with the standard treatment with incremental costs per QALY in US dollars of 24 056 . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested intensive BP treatment would be cost effective compared with standard treatment 86.7 of the time at a willingness to pay threshold of 60 000 per QALY . The result of this study showed that intensive BP treatment appears to be a cost effective choice for patients with a high risk of CVD in Saudi Arabia when compared with standard treatment .
1444,To evaluate the validity and reliability of the 5 level EuroQol 5 dimensional questionnaire through classical test theory and the Rasch measurement model . Three hundred patients treated for uncomplicated malaria in selected primary healthcare facilities of Plateau state Nigeria completed the EQ 5D 5L scale . Classical test theory was used to establish validity and Cronbachs alpha reliability of the scale . Rasch analysis was used to confirm the unidimensionality item fitness item and person separations and reliabilities and targeting of item difficulty to patient ability levels and presentation on Wright map . The outcome of classical test theory revealed unidimensional scale with average variance extracted values 0.5 and the square root of the average variance extracted for construct was greater than the correlation coefficients indicating convergent and discriminant validities of the scale whose Cronbachs alpha coefficient was 0.87 . Rasch analysis indicated variance explained values of 88.3 and the eigenvalues of the first contrast was 1.3 further confirming the unidimensionality of the scale whose fit index values were within accepted ranges . The high item and person separation and reliability values indicated the instruments strength in detecting and evenly spreading items and persons on the Wright map based on item difficulty and the respondents ability levels respectively . The EQ 5D 5L scale performed well in uncomplicated malaria hence it is recommended for use in the assessment of health related quality of life in this patient population .
1445,Most countries recommend that their healthcare personnel be vaccinated against influenza in order to protect themselves as well as their patients . However despite the strong scientific rationale recommendations and advocacy from health organizations influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel remains low . This has been attributed to various obstacles and a range of strategies have been implemented to increase uptake with varying levels of success . To highlight the vaccination coverage beliefs and obstacles among healthcare personnel in India and to discuss strategies that can be implemented to improve influenza vaccination coverage . Various barriers are responsible for the low influenza vaccination coverage among Indian healthcare personnel . Many interventions are being practiced but they need to be multidimensional keeping in mind that healthcare personnel value their autonomy in making decisions about vaccinations .
1446,The SAARC is a geopolitical organization composed of 8 neighboring countries Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India the Maldives Nepal Pakistan and Sri Lanka . The objective of this study was to compare the prices of some selected drugs in SAARC countries . A list of 24 drugs was prepared based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria . The retail prices of the drugs were determined from different sources and verified manually in the open market . The prices obtained in local currencies were converted into US dollars for comparison purposes . In another analysis the gross domestic product of each country was factored for comparative analysis . Out of the 23 drugs 17 comparisons across countries were statistically different at Prices of selected drugs varied markedly in SAARC countries . After adjusting for GDP drug prices became more polarized across countries with Nepal featuring the highest prices . In determining drug prices the countrys GDP and the populations purchasing power need to be taken into account .
1447,The combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is currently the gold standard in treating chronic hepatitis C virus patients in Malaysia and is reimbursed by the Malaysian authorities . This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of the ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin regimen as compared with the PegIFN RBV or no treatment in chronic HCV Genotype 1 treatment nave and treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in Malaysia . A Markov model based on previously published CE models of HCV was adapted for the Malaysian public healthcare payer perspective based on good modeling practices . Treatment attributes included efficacy regimen duration and EQ 5D treatment related health utility . Transitional probabilities and health state health utilities were derived from previous studies . Costs were derived from Malaysian data sources . Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.0 per year . Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties around key variables . Based on the analysis patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSBRBV showed less frequent progression to compensated cirrhosis decompensated cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma and liver related deaths when compared with standard care . At a price of MYR 1846 day the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective over PegIFN RBV and yields better outcomes in terms of life years gained and quality adjusted life years at a higher cost which is still well below the implied willingness to pay threshold of MYR 384 503 QALY . The OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective for treatment nave treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic GT1 chronic HCV patients in Malaysia .
1448,The present systematic review aimed to assess the healthcare financing system by studying the relevant indicators in low and middle income countries . The focus of this research was on the entire healthcare system without considering any specific healthcare service or population group . This article explains the conditions of equity in peoples payments for healthcare services in LMICs and focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of successful or failed healthcare systems . A systematic search was conducted in the existing database that included the data up to December 2016 . The quantity of equity was estimated using relevant indicators and comparing the results with indicators specific values . Narrative synthesis was then performed for the purpose of reporting the results . A total of 17 articles from 14 regions including Palestine China China China Ghana Hungary Iran Tunisia Tanzania Malaysia Malawi Zimbabwe Uganda and Chile met the inclusion criteria . The findings indicated that the insurance system is the most equitable method of financing whereas direct payment is the most unfair method . Nevertheless many countries still struggle with various payment methods and people use direct payments . Results revealed that several factors can affect a countrys failure to establish equity in financing the health system . These factors include an increase in direct payments by people to reduce the governments share failure to cover insurance for the entire population and problems in identifying people from low income groups and setting rules for exempting them from taxes .
1449,Escalating healthcare costs calls for the efficiency of health services especially in the intensive care unit where the bulk of resources are used . This study aims to identify the length of stay and cost of care at ICUs which are proxy indicators of efficiency and the factors determining them . A cross sectional study of patients requiring ICU admissions in a teaching hospital in Malaysia from 2013 to 2015 was conducted . The cost at the ICU was estimated using the step down approach . Factors that determined the cost and LOS at the ICU were also explored by using multivariate regression analysis . Each day of stay cost 427 at the pediatric intensive care unit and 1324 at the general intensive care unit . The mean LOS at the ICU was 5.7 days 8.4 with a median of 4 days 1 16.7 days . Average cost of care at the ICU per episode of care was 5473 and the median was 3463 . ICU patients spent 29.3 of the total stay and 47.2 of the cost at ICU units . Upon multivariate regression analysis severity case base group and type of ICU that the patient was admitted to were associated with the cost and LOS at ICU . Compared with critical care practices in hospitals from more developed nations a Malaysian teaching hospital required a longer length of ICU stay . Hence implementations of strategies that can reduce the length of stay and hospital costs without compromising healthcare quality are required .
1450,In the last two decades several countries in Latin America have shown an interest in developing health technology assessments but the process has not been uniform and has often been challenged by the health systems characteristics and the political or economic idiosyncrasies of these countries . This article summarizes the discussions held by the participants at the 40th ISPOR HTA Council Roundtable for LA . An additional literature review was carried out to support some of the concepts included . This article includes a brief description of the implementation of HTA over the last 30 years and then a conceptual analysis using examples of the broader use of HTA to support procurement decisions and risk sharing agreements which might play a future role in healthcare priority setting in LA . Formerly HTA processes and methods played important although mostly isolated roles . Nowadays with more and more innovative technologies and the establishment of value frameworks to support the priority setting in healthcare HTA features a promising panorama for the health systems sustainability .
1451,Healthcare costs are a concern for the sustainability of health systems in both rich and poor countries . Achieving a balance between the aspirations of payers and the manufacturers of new technologies is a challenge for democratic societies . Evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of a new intervention is a fundamental aspect for its inclusion but additional information about organization implementation and feasibility is required . Economic evaluations especially cost effectiveness analyses help inform the choice of a particular health intervention but they are not the only input for decision making . Use of CEA is relatively recent but has quickly become widespread . CEA techniques have evolved into increasingly complex and sophisticated methods intended to reflect reality closely but at the same time their results have become more difficult to verify and validate . In developed countries CEA results have generated intense debates but in developing countries these reflections are still weak due to lack of technical capacity . Competing perspectives on CEAs exist and can heavily influence the DM process . The use of CEAs and the interpretation of their results requires critical analysis especially when public funds are to be invested . Here we present a perspective on the use of CEAs for DM that arises from our experience of its use in developing countries and requires the consideration of other rationalities in addition to the economic one for DM .
1452,Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative neurological disorder . Treatment aims to avoid relapses and disability progression . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for treating highly active relapsing remitting MS patients from the Colombian third party payer perspective . We used a Markov economic model from the perspective of the Colombian healthcare system to estimate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for RRMS with high disease activity or failure of interferons as first line therapy . This model was centered on disability progression and relapses . We considered a 5 year time horizon with a 5 discount rate . We included only direct medical costs . Local experts were consulted to obtain resource utilization estimates and local standardized costing methodologies and sources were used . Outcome was considered in terms of quality adjusted life years . Utilities were extracted or calculated from the literature . Transition probabilities were calculated from available efficacy and safety information . Natalizumab showed lower total costs and higher QALY yield than fingolimod dominating it . Univariate sensitivity analysis showcased the relevance of the measures of effect on disability progression for natalizumab on model results . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis replicated base case results in most simulations . This study showed that natalizumab dominated fingolimod with lower costs and higher QALYs in patients with high activity RRMS . These results are consistent with previous published international literature .
1453,As health systems start to discuss alternative payment models for fostering value in healthcare there is increased interest in understanding how physicians will cope with different remuneration schemes . We conducted a survey of physicians practicing at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein a nonprofit private healthcare provider in Brazil aimed at capturing their awareness of value based healthcare . Our study uses data from a survey administered to doctors practicing at Einstein between September and November 2018 . Descriptive statistics and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to describe physicians characteristics associated with their views on VBHC . A total of 1000 physicians completed the survey . Although only 25 knewthe value equation 67 defined value in health according to Portersthe outcomes that matter to patients in relation to the costs of offering such outcomes . Most participants identified increased healthcare costs as the main reason for the discussions over new financing models . Only 27 of physicians rated their awareness of VBHC as high or very high . In the multivariate analysis awareness of VBHC was associated with holding a management position scoring high in the hospitals physician segmentation program being familiar with the value equation and attributing high importance to developing new VBHC financing models for health system transformation . Physician awareness of key VBHC concepts is still heterogeneous in our clinical setting . Promoting opportunities for involving physicians in the discussion of VBHC is key for a successful value driven transformation of healthcare .
1454,Countries have constrained healthcare budgets and must prioritize new interventions depending on health goals and time frame . This situation is relevant in the sphere of national immunization programs for which many different vaccines are proposed budgets are limited and efficient choices must be made in the order of vaccine introduction . A constrained optimization model for infectious diseases was developed in which different intervention types were combined for consideration in Malaysia . Local experts defined their priority public health issues pneumococcal disease dengue hepatitis B and C rotavirus neonatal pertussis and cholera . Epidemiological cost and effectiveness data were informed from local or regionally published literature . The model aimed to maximize quality adjusted life year gain through the reduction of events in each of the different diseases under budget and intervention coverage constraints . The QALY impact of the interventions was assessed over 2 periods lifetime and 20 years . The period of investment was limited to 15 years . The assessment time horizon influenced the prioritization of interventions maximizing QALY gain . The incremental health gains compared with a uninformed prioritization were large for the first 8 years and declined thereafter . Rotaviral and pneumococcal vaccines were identified as key priorities irrespective of time horizon hepatitis B immune prophylaxis and hepatitis C treatment were priorities with the lifetime horizon and dengue vaccination replaced these with the 20 year horizon . CO modeling is a useful tool for making economically efficient decisions within public health programs for the control of infectious diseases by helping prioritize the selection of interventions to maximize health gain under annual budget constraints .
1455,To examine the factors associated with satisfaction with healthcare services provided to patients with diabetes hypertension and or dyslipidemia in the Mexican population . In a cross sectional retrospective study we used data from the 2016 Half Way National Health and Nutrition Survey in Mexico . This contained self reported information about patient satisfaction and use of healthcare services by 2529 adults . An ordinal regression model was performed to identify predictors of overall patient satisfaction . Good or very good satisfaction was reported by 85.2 of the respondents . Patient satisfaction was positively associated with the quality of medical care 29.71 95 confidence interval 9.04 97.62 good OR 13.24 95 CI 5.07 34.57 and regular OR 6.56 95 CI 2.49 17.30 and having been attended by a medical specialist . Patient satisfaction was negatively associated with a worse perception of health status no change in health status time in the waiting room and poor conditions of the health center . There are several elements of organization structure and delivery of healthcare that are associated with patient satisfaction although our findings need to be confirmed using longitudinal designs . Governments could use these findings to strengthen actions for improving patient satisfaction .
1456,The ICEpop CAPability measure for adults is a measure of capability well being for adults and by focusing on more than health can extend the evaluative space of economic evaluations . The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the ICECAP A questionnaire into Persian to assess the construct validity and reliability of the ICECAP A in the Iranian general population . In this study we followed Beatons guidelines for cross cultural adaptation of self report measures . The questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1200 members of the general population using a stratified probability sampling method . The construct validity and reliability of the ICECAP A were evaluated in relation to the EuroQol 5 dimension questionnaire . After translating and adapting the questionnaire the term being settled was changed to stability for the Iranian cultural context . A moderate correlation was found between the ICECAP A and EQ 5D 5L index scores and the ICECAP A scores showed differences across different health and socio economic groups . The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 2 instruments measured 2 different constructs . In terms of reliability the internal consistency of the measure using Cronbachs alpha was found to be 0.82 and for testretest reliability the intraclass correlation coefficient was found to be 0.90 for total scores . The results of this study suggest that the Persian version of the ICECAP A is a valid and reliable questionnaire and can complement EQ 5D measures already used in Iran .
1457,To describe the process and results of the implementation of a performance based risk sharing arrangement for the use of certolizumab pegol in patients with rheumatoid arthritis based on rational pharmacotherapy . In 2014 the area of Management of Drugs and Supplies of the health maintenance organization of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires signed a performance based risk sharing arrangement with Montpellier Laboratory for the use of certolizumab pegol in patients with RA . The laboratory would reimburse the hospital the cost of the first 10 doses of the drug if an optimal clinical response was not achieved measured at the beginning and at the end or if the patient presented with an adverse drug reaction during the first 12 weeks of treatment . Forty patients with RA were included between September 2014 and January 2018 . Thirty six patients completed 12 weeks of treatment of which 25 had an optimal clinical response . The laboratory reimbursed the hospital 116 doses of certolizumab pegol corresponding to 12 patients . Eleven of them did not reach the optimal clinical response and 1 presented with an adverse drug reaction . The performance based risk sharing arrangement proved to be a useful tool to optimize the resources of the healthcare payer and contributed to the collection of scientific evidence in real life patients .
1458,To calculate the total revenue under a hypothetical 1 Malaysian Ringgit prescription cost sharing model in government healthcare facilities in Pahang Malaysia . A cross sectional study was conducted at outpatient pharmacy in all government healthcare facilities in Pahang from year 2013 to 2017 . Each dispensed medication was calculated as 1 MYR and contributed to the total revenue . A total of 11 hospitals and 81 health clinics were recruited into the study . A hospital could generate 0.311 million MYR per year and a district health department could generate 0.623 million MYR per year giving a total of 10.268 million MYR revenue every year in Pahang Malaysia . Under the prescription medicines cost sharing scheme it was shown that an average of 9.4 of the total pharmaceutical spending could be recovered . The recovery percentage was approximately fourfold higher in health clinics when compared with that in hospitals . An estimated 10 million MYR or 10 from the total Ministry of Health pharmaceutical spending could be collected under the proposed 1 MYR prescription cost sharing model .
1459,The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between pharmaceutical therapyrelated quality of life and health utility scores since such data was not available . The dataset of 1156 outpatients with chronic diseases from 3 public university hospitals in Bangkok Thailand were applied . The Patient Reported Outcomes Measure of Pharmaceutical Therapy for Quality of Life was utilized to assess PTRQoL . HU measures included EQ 5D 5L and EuroQoL Visual Analog Scale . Multiple linear regressions using a stepwise approach were applied to evaluate the relationships between the PROMPT QoL and the HU scores . The results found that the EQ 5D 5L was mostly correlated with the impacts of medicines and side effects followed by the medicine effectiveness psychologic impacts of medication use and availability and accessibility domains of the PROMPT QoL respectively actual R The PROMPT QoL had medium correlations with the EQ 5D 5L and EQ VAS scores . Their relationships depended on HU approaches used . More research is needed to examine the relationships between the PROMPT QoL or other PTRQoL instruments and other HU scores in other settings and populations .
1460,This article aims to support the development of practical guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Asia by systematically reviewing economic evaluation studies of such early detection strategies in Asian countries . A systematic literature review was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis Protocols checklist . The quality of reviewed studies was examined using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement . A total of 15 articles on the economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection based in Asia were reviewed . Cost effectiveness was used in all the studies as the analytic method to compare the cost and consequences of different screening policies . Ten studies were categorized as incorporating the modeled approach . Fourteen studies analysed the cost effectiveness of the organized population based approach in which mammography screening was the prevailing screening modality . Only one study evaluated the cost effectiveness of early diagnosis for breast cancer patients in order to provide early treatment . The results from the identified economic evaluations and consequent recommendations concerning optimal early detection strategies varied among studies and depended on key parameters and assumption used as well as differences in inter country health resources breast cancer incidence prevalence and early detection pathways . The economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection programs is still limited in Asia . Policy decisions on organized mammography screening in women 50 are economically attractive in the region despite the lack of evidence to provide recommendations on opportunistic screening strategy and early diagnosis strategy . Future studies need to provide better transparency of the data used and cover more comprehensive strategies to make them relevant and adaptable to other Asian countries resulting in clear policy recommendations on breast cancer early detection strategies .
1461,The Indian health system is undergoing significant reform toward more evidence informed and inclusive health policy as the country strives toward the achievement of Universal Health Coverage for its 1.3 billion population . Cost information plays a key role in the evidence arsenal of Universal Health Coverageoriented policy by informing decisions such as the setting reimbursement rates for government sponsored health insurance packages of care strategic purchasing of health services and in prioritizing available resources to maximize value of health sector investments . However extensive and quality health facility cost data in India are limited . As a result there is an increasing and urgent need to generate and disseminate healthcare cost information . This article discusses the need for cost information and the current initiatives that are progressing this agenda . The first is a national cost database and website hosting cost data collected from 200 public sector facilities across 6 Indian states at each level of the care delivery system by a consortium of health research institutes . This database is the first of its kind in India and will serve as a central resource for researchers and decision makers for information on healthcare costs . The second is a nationwide costing study of healthcare at both private and public facilities . By improving the availability of cost data in India raising its profile and demonstrating its utility it is hoped that the database and new costing efforts will lead to greater recognition of the importance of good quality data to inform health policy and enable more evidence informed decision making .
1462,This study aims to translate culturally adapt and validate the Short Form 6D instruments for measuring quality of life as outcome parameters in pharmacoeconomic studies . The forward backward methods were applied to translate the SF 6D questionnaire . A preliminary Indonesian version of SF 6D questionnaire was field tested in samples of 470 adult general population .

Convergent validity showed a weak and moderate correlation between dimensions on SF 6D and Euro Quality of life 5D . The SF 6D questionnaire has been translated into Indonesian version . The SF 6D questionnaire is valid and reliable . Known group validity shows that the SF 6D could differentiate utility scores by age group and history present illness .
1463,The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of adopting a pharmaceutical care model on clinical outcomes patient satisfaction and cost at a health payer level . All patients with hepatitis C virus who were insured by Bupa Arabia with a direct acting antivirals prior authorization drug request between April 2015 and October 2018 were included in this retrospective quasi experimental study . The clinical outcome was the achievement of a sustained virologic response at least 12 weeks from end of treatment . Economic and patients satisfaction outcomes were included in this study . The differences in cost of treatment was analyzed by using the paired A total of 371 patients were enrolled in this program of which 74 required clinical intervention . Among those HCV treatment was modified for 64 . The overall cure rate was 97 among 267 patients for which sustained virologic responses were available . The results of the paired A structured pharmaceutical care program for HCV patients can guide the use of specialty medications to achieve optimal clinical outcomes with lower expenditures and high patients satisfaction . We can conclude that healthcare insurance can play a key role in managing specialty pharmaceuticals like HCV medications . Because this is a preliminary study further studies are needed in an experimental design to strengthen the evidence behind the effectiveness of such a program .

This study aims to identify the major causes of under 5 mortality across the selected nations of Brazil the Russian Federation India China and South Africa . Secondary data served as inputs to the survey . Relevant data were obtained from the World Bank data repository the United Nations Development Program and the World Health Organizations official online repository between the years 2000 and 2015 . Descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as trend analysis analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance were used to make sense of the relationship between the macro community and individual level variables on under 5 mortality . The results indicated a decreasing pattern in deaths from all the disease conditions affecting the under 5 age group for all 5 countries . The outcome of the study provides insights on disease transitions over time across the regions which may have policy related and educational implications .
1465,In Mexico breast cancer is often not detected until it is already at an advanced stage . Many women know about breast self examination but few do it correctly . BSE can assist in the early detection of breast cancer and a valid and reliable instrument to help determine the factors of the Health Belief Model that affect the practice of BSE in Mexican women would thus be advantageous . This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Health Belief Model Scale for BSE and identifies the factors that influence its practice . A cross sectional design was used 738 Mexican women aged 20 years and older who attended a tertiary public hospital were evaluated . The HBMS of Champion was translated into Spanish . Focus groups of women were consulted and experts judgments were gathered to determine content validity . In the exploratory factor analysis a structure of 6 factors was obtained and Cronbachs alpha scales ranged between 0.65 and 0.84 . BSE practice was associated with age 1.05 confidence interval 1.03 1.07 self efficacy barriers and health motivation . The Spanish version of the HBMS is an adequate valid and reliable instrument for the Mexican population that allows us to evaluate their beliefs about breast cancer and BSE and it should also be applicable to other Spanish speaking people . Perceived barriers self efficacy and health motivation in particular should be considered in the development of health promotion programs for Mexican women .
1466,To characterize at a global level the concept of therapeutic value and describe the experience of value based pricing policies in 6 reference countries . We conducted a rapid review of the literature that addressed 2 exploratory research questions . A systematic and exhaustive search was carried out up to July 2018 in MEDLINE Embase Scopus and Web of Science . The concepts of TV and VBP are related value frameworks for medicines should include social preferences comparative effectiveness safety adoption viability social impact high quality of evidence severity of illness and innovation . The added therapeutic value is the manner of measuring the therapeutic advantages of new medicines compared with existing ones in terms of comparative effectiveness and safety . There are variations in the mechanisms of reimbursement and drug pricing regulation between the countries of study . In a VBP system it is essential to establish the TV and ATV of a new medicine . Although there are no methodological guidelines for the implementation of VBP policies the process implies from the beginning the definition of TV categories that will be included in the drug pricing and reimbursement systems . Agreements between the pharmaceutical industry and governments have become a useful tool as a negotiating mechanism in most countries .
1467,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a severe progressive disease with poor prognosis . Patients show an increased healthcare utilization pattern consisting of regular physician consultations and monitoring tests . The aim of the present study was to estimate healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures for IPF patients in Greece . An IPF specific questionnaire was constructed which focused on retrospective healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures within a 6 month period . Upon informed consent the questionnaires were completed anonymously . The study sample included 123 IPF patients . Within a 6 month period 85.4 of the patients visited their treating physician 1.400 29.4 visited other physicians for IPF related reasons 42.9 visited a healthcare setting and 10.6 required hospitalization . Spirometry and blood tests were the most common tests for IPF monitoring . Almost half of the respondents stated they had private expenditures for IPF medication physician visits hospital services medical tests or other IPF related reasons . IPF management requires regular contact with healthcare services and uptake of specific medical tests . Considering the high proportion of patients bearing out of pocket costs along with the decline of incomes in Greece improvement of the disease management is important and action should be taken to lower the financial burden imposed on patients .
1468,To introduce and discuss the cost and effectiveness of using sofosbuvir daclatasvir and simeprevir antivirals in combination or not with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C as based on real world data . We analyzed the treatment and outcomes of 253 patients from a retrospective cohort held in a specialized assistance service in the municipality of Porto Alegre Brazil . Regarding costs we considered only the direct costs of the antiviral medications per unit according to the financial receipts of the public procurements . We calculated the total cost of treatment per individual and the cost per cure expressed in sustained virologic response . Most patients were carriers of the genotype 1 of hepatitis and 92.9 reached the SVR . The average cost of the treatment for genotype 1 patients was 5 862.31 USD per patient and 6 310.34 for the cure for genotype 3 patients on the other hand the cost was 5 144.27 per patient and 5 974.76 for the cure . The drugs purchasing cost was around 40 less than was estimated for the process of incorporating them into the public health system . The results indicated that good rates of effectiveness were achieved with different combinations of the medicines . The costs of the medicines were still deemed too high for the Brazilian reality however . Therefore the results contribute to support the formulation and review of public policies based on strong evidence and on real world data for the treatment of hepatitis C .
1469,To elicit a willingness to pay per quality adjusted life year estimate for the general Greek population and assess the impact of individuals socio demographic characteristics and motives on this estimate . A telephone based survey was carried out employing a representative sample of the general Greek population . A computer assisted telephone interview method was adopted to ensure random sampling . A total of 528 participants reported a WTP value for a utility improvement from their current health to perfect health . Those individuals motives were assessed through predefined statements . Testretest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient . Multiple linear regression and one way analysis of variance tests were conducted to assess the effect of socioeconomic demographic determinants and motive statements respectively on WTP QALY . MLR was re estimated considering as dependent variable the WTP QALY estimate calculated for participants stating a WTP value their household income and presenting higher certainty regarding stated WTP value . Analysis revealed good reliability for WTP QALY estimates and motive statements . Mean WTP QALY was 26280 . The respective 5 trimmed value was 14862 . Being a student and household income affected WTP QALY . Sensitivity analysis did not produce markedly different WTP QALY predictors implying the robustness of results irrespective of the participant group considered . Individuals who indicated the inability to cover basic family needs or pay tax claims as motives reported lower WTP QALY values compared with those not viewing these aspects as motives . Findings confirm that the World Health Organizations criterion used currently in Greek cost effectiveness studies is not unreasonable . Additional research is essential to further explore WTP QALY estimates in the Greek setting and facilitate informed decision making .
1470,The analysis aims to assess the cost effectiveness of cefuroxime in the prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery compared with the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis from the National Health Fund perspective in Poland . We performed a cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis using the decision tree and Markov model respectively for patients after cataract surgery . The efficacy of Aprokam was 0.21 0.08 0.55 and is based on the results of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery study . According to the epidemiological data from Poland the risk of POE is 0.377 . The costs associated with the Aprokam administration and POE treatment costs were included . We determined the utilities of the health states in the model depending on visual loss due to POE . To determine the uncertainty of estimates parameters a one way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed . Using Aprokam allows avoiding 0.003 POEs per patient . The benefit from the intervention is 0.0007 quality adjusted life years per patient in the lifetime horizon . The total costs of prophylaxis are higher at about 1.70 . The cost of avoiding one POE is about 569.85 . The estimated incremental cost effectiveness utility ratio is equal to 2427.72 quality adjusted life years and it is significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold in Poland in 2019 . In all scenarios of performed one way sensitivity analyses Aprokam is cost effective . In Poland the use of Aprokam is cost effective with the estimated incremental cost utility ratio significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold .
1471,Severe consequences of mother to child transmission of syphilis and high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public health problem in Brazil . Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of a rapid point of care test and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory based standard test with treatment at next follow up visit . A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio between antenatal syphilis screening strategies . The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3 and 5 discount rates . A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model . Health outcomes low birth weight stillbirths neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability adjusted life years lost . Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken . For base case the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was 2.63 and 2.48 respectively . Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs and 0.0048 DALYs per mother screened . Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was 298.08 . After 10000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs incremental cost and health benefits were 0.15 and 0.00042 DALYs respectively with a mean ICER of 357.44 per DALY . Screening with RT has a 58 chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of 3 200 per DALY . In Brazil antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings .
1472,To evaluate excess healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with both type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease relative to those with T2D only in Israel . A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients with T2D from the Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel who enrolled in a cardiovascular registry between 2013 and 2016 . Patients with established CVD between 2013 and 2016 were propensity matched 1 2 to control patients without established CVD . HRU and medical costs were extracted for a 2 year observation period and analyzed using generalized linear models . Overall 4 582 patients with established CVD were matched 1 2 to 9151 controls . HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with established CVD versus controls across a wide range of resources . In total annual costs per patient were 10011.8 and 7206.8 in patients with established CVD and controls respectively . Hospitalizations primary care visits and medications for any condition were the main cost drivers with greater utilization and higher costs in the established CVD group versus controls In a real world setting HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with T2D and established CVD compared with controls across the vast majority of resource types . These up to date cost estimates of CVD improve our understanding of the financial implications of established CVD beyond the direct expenses .
1473,Barriers to Diabetes Adherence instrument is a measure developed in English to assess barriers to adherence in adolescents with type 1 diabetes . The main objectives of the present study were to translate and culturally adapt the BDA tool into Arabic for the assessment of barriers to adherence in adolescents with T1DM in Arabic speaking populations . The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines for the translation and cultural adaptation of patient reported outcome measures were used for the process . Permission to use the instrument was obtained from the developers . This was followed by 2 forward translations of the tool into Arabic . The 2 Arabic versions were combined into a reconciled Arabic version that was then back translated into English . This was then tested against the original tool . The resultant Arabic version underwent a cognitive debriefing process to assess its comprehension and appropriateness among potential users and this resulted in further refinements leading to the final Arabic version of the tool . The translation and cognitive debriefing processes revealed issues related to the cultural or conceptual equivalence of the tool that were addressed and resolved by rewording restructuring or addition or elimination of words or phrases that in certain circumstances necessitated communications with the developers for further clarifications of the intended meaning of relevant items . This process generated an easy comprehensive clear and culturally acceptable tool as proven by the cognitive debriefing and clinical review processes . A culturally acceptable Arabic translation of the BDA tool was developed to be used in adolescent Arabic population with T1DM .
1474,There are challenges in conducting a budget impact analysis for rare disorders . Through this case study we present some challenges and limitations of a BIA of managing patients affected with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency . We explored a conceptual basis and barriers for health services researchers interested in quantifying budget impacts of rare disease management program . We developed a static budget impact cost calculator model in Microsoft Excel obtaining the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and translating it into costs using OLDW . Cost inputs and resource use was obtained from 2010 to 2015 claims data using the OLDW . Insurers payments were calculated and categorized into the following cost buckets physician visits emergency room visits inpatients stays augmentation therapy other prescription drugs costs and other costs . Data were based on 6832 patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency identified among over 21 million OLDW enrollees observed between January 1 2010 and December 31 2015 . The introduction of a DMP was estimated to decrease costs of the management of patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency by 13.5 million over 5 years . The savings attributed to the program over the 5 year time horizon are due to 2555 exacerbations 5180 emergency room visits 9342 specialist visits and 105358 general practitioner visits avoided . A comprehensive DMP for a rare condition might provide cost savings to a health plan . BIAs for rare disease may be more informative if they focus on DMPs rather than on individual drugs .
1475,One of the core principles of rational prescribing is consideration of the cost of the medicines prescribed especially in countries with high patient copayments and low incomes such as Nigeria . Little is known about Nigerian physicians knowledge about the cost of commonly prescribed medicines . Descriptive cross sectional survey conducted among physicians in 3 tertiary institutions in Nigeria . Apart from socio demographic and other information questions about the estimated costs of branded and generic versions of 11 commonly prescribed medications were included in the questionnaire . One hundred and seventy nine respondents agreed that costs of medicines were important when writing prescriptions although only 7 of them had any formal training in the economics of healthcare . The median percentages of respondents with accurate estimated costs for generic and originator brands were 6.2 and 12 respectively . Respondents were more knowledgeable about the cost of medicines used for the treatment of infectious diseases than noncommunicable diseases . The knowledge of Nigerian physicians in the 3 participating hospitals about the costs of commonly prescribed medicines was poor . This is despite their awareness about the importance of costs of medicines when prescribing .
1476,To perform cost consequence and cost effectiveness analyses of 2 methods of donor human milk preservationHolder pasteurization and high pressure processing in human milk banks in Poland . We used the results of the LACTOTECHnology as an answer to special nutritional requirements of preterm infants preclinical study on the impact of different preservation methods on the content of bioactive milk components . The cost analysis was performed from the hospital perspective . To estimate the Diagnosis Related Group tariff for enteral feeding with DHM preserved by HPP the pricing process used by the Polish health technology assessment agency was followed . One way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on costs and human milk component parameters were undertaken . HPP maintains an average of 55 more potentially beneficial DHM components than HoP but is more expensive . The DRG tariff relating to milk from human milk banks preserved by the HPP method should be about 54 higher than with HoP . The cost effectiveness ratio ranged from 0.84 to 10.27 per 1 gain in the active compound content in a daily portion of DHM . Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of an HPP device had the most significant impact on pascalization expenses . HPP is a potentially more beneficial method of DHM preservation than HoP but it is also about 7 times more expensive . Because of high pascalization costs the cost effectiveness analysis based on clinically significant endpoints will play an important role in decision making regarding the implementation of HPP into clinical practice of human milk banking .
1477,To assess productivity loss variations across a set of chronic diseases and analyze significant PL drivers in Hungary . Data from 11 cost of illness studies were pooled and patient level data were analyzed . A weighted multiple linear regression analysis was run to identify significant PL indicators . All costs were adjusted to 2018 euro rates and PL was further presented as a proportion of gross domestic product capita facilitating results comparability and transferability . The dataset comprised 1888 patients from 11 chronic diseases . The average indirect cost ratio was highest in schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis and lowest in benign prostatic hyperplasia . Correlation results infer that a higher EuroQol 5 dimension 3 level index score was significantly associated with lower PL . The number of hospital admissions was the main contributor toward increasing PL among resource use indicators . Age and sex showed inconsistent and insignificant correlations with PL . In regression analysis a better EuroQol 5 dimension 3 level index score and higher education were consistently associated with decreasing PL in all models . This article will enable health decision makers to understand the importance of adopting a societal perspective for chronic disease reimbursement decisions . The correlation between PL and health status supports that timely started effective treatments may prevent patients from losing their workability .
1478,To describe South Africanspecific multi attribute health related quality of life research within a national health technology assessment context and make recommendations to strengthen the field for capacity building and healthcare priority setting . A systematic review was conducted using the Web of Science platform and the Cochrane Library . No time restrictions were applied but only English and Afrikaans language papers were included . Duplicate records were removed before first and second pass screening by two reviewers working independently . Bibliometric analyses were conducted in VOSviewer the WoS platform and Microsoft Excel . The study identified 123 publications authored by 388 researchers at 163 organizations in 31 countries since the first article was published in 1996 . Three quarters of the publications were from the last decade . South African institutions produced the most publications but their influence was below that of most other countries and there were very few connections among the 68 identified author clusters . South African universities were the most productive institutions with limited involvement by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries . Funding was mostly from domestic sources with some international contribution . There was an increasing trend in South Africanspecific HRQoL data with a strong contribution by South Africanbased academic researchers . A multidisciplinary approach and more cross country collaboration with organizations in countries with experience in economic evaluations for HTA would aid research capacity building supportive of healthcare policy and priority setting in South Africa .
1479,To estimate the budget impact of the expansion of liposomal amphotericin B use for all confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil . Currently the first line medicine for VL treatment is meglumine antimoniate . Liposomal amphotericin B is indicated only for patients with a greater risk of severity by the disease . The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Brazilian public healthcare system over 3 years considering the following 2 scenarios the reference scenario with the current recommendations for VL treatment and the alternative scenario based on the use of liposomal amphotericin B for all patients . A diffusion rate of 60 was used in the first year 80 in the second year and 100 in the third year . The epidemiological parameters used in the analysis came from the Notifiable Diseases Information System and from a clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of medicines for the treatment of VL in the country . The costs were related to the treatment of VL and to hospital and outpatient care . In the reference scenario the total cost for treatment of the 3453 VL confirmed cases in 2014 was 1447611.75 . The incremental budget impact with the use of liposomal amphotericin B for all the VL confirmed cases was 299646.43 in the third year . The analysis presented will support the decision process for the use and expansion of liposomal amphotericin B for all VL confirmed cases in Brazil .
1480,To develop and validate a measure of asthma knowledge and to translate and culturally adapt the measure into the Arabic language and context . Medically diagnosed individuals 18 years and older were recruited in primary care and specialty asthma clinics in the United Arab Emirates . The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommendations for education on asthma were used as a framework to develop the Asthma Knowledge Test . A measurement scale of Yes No and I dont know was selected . Descriptive statistics were calculated for participant demographics and other healthcare information . Cronbach 0.7 was used to measure reliability . Principal component analysis was used to determine the distinct areas of asthma knowledge covered by the AKT . Differences in asthma knowledge depending on sex age marital status and education were tested using multivariate analyses of variance . Cronbach .70 . Four components were retained and included asthma as a common disease triggers and control issues inhalers and beliefs and myths . The average AKT score 13.95 2.77 . There was a significant effect of participant level of education on the AKT scores . The availability of the AKT in Arabic is a valuable addition to the limited available tools related to asthma . As a simple and short tool it could be used in clinical practice and research to identify specific areas of patient asthma knowledge needing improvements hence targeted interventions are sought .
1481,We aim to explore how the current increase in Healthcare Insurance Coverage in Colombia potentially affected educational inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality from 1998 to2015 . The official death database for the period 1998 to 2015 codified by cause of death for CVD . People with a lower educational level have an increased risk of dying prematurely owing to CVD the higher inequalities being those for young women . Inequalities by educational level grew at a rate of 2.5 per year in men and 1.7 in women despite the steady increase of HIC throughout the period . From 1998 to 2011 there was a significant decrease in mortality rates owing to CVD . As of 2011 there was an increase only for men . In Colombia educational inequalities could be a cause of the worrying increase in mortality caused by CVD which affects women more than men whereas the HIC seem to be ineffective at reducing educational inequalities and therefore mortality by CVD .
1482,Evaluate the acceptability ceiling and floor effects reliability and known group validity of the Brazilian version of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication version 1.4 in patients with hypertension . The sample consisted of 300 hypertensive patients undergoing treatment in an outpatient department . The acceptability was evaluated from the items not answered in the TSQM . The reliability of the TSQM was estimated through Cronbach s alpha . Known group validity tested whether the TSQM discriminates satisfaction between different stages of hypertension diagnoses of left ventricular hypertrophy medication adherence and occurrence of side effects . The TSQM had high acceptability . A substantial ceiling effect was found in the side effect and global satisfaction subscales . Reliability evaluated with Cronbach s alpha showed values 0.76 in all subscales . Known group validity was supported with a statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction effectiveness between the hypertension groups and those without left ventricular hypertrophy . Regarding medication adherence the TSQM was able to discriminate satisfaction in the side effect and global satisfaction subscales . A significantly higher satisfaction was found in all subscales of the TSQM in those patients without side effects . The TSQM is a reliable and valid questionnaire to be used in Brazilians with hypertension .
1483,Vascular and biliary complications associated with liver transplants involve high morbidity and mortality as well as cost overrun for health systems . Efforts to prioritize their prevention require not only clinical information but also information on costs that reflect the economic burden on health systems . The objective of this study was to describe cost overrun incurred from early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant . This cases series included liver transplant patients treated at the San Vicente Foundation University Hospital Rionegro Antioquia from January 1 2013 to December 31 2018 . All liver transplant patients treated during the above period were included the absence of clinical records on the variables of interest was considered the exclusion criterion . A probabilistic analysis of patient cost was performed . Monte Carlo simulations as well as a 1 way sensitivity analysis per transplant cost component were performed . Records from 154 patients were assessed . The average patient age was 56.9 years 42.9 of patients were women . Of all 36.4 patients were classified as Child C and the average Model for End Stage Liver Disease score was 19.6 . The average cost for patients without complications was 27834.82 whereas that for patients with early vascular complications was 36747.83 and for those with early biliary complications was 38523.74 . Early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant increase healthcare costs with the increase being significant in patients with biliary complications .
1484,To evaluate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of the addition of bevacizumab to first line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer from the perspective of the Colombian health system . A Markov model was employed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab carboplatin paclitaxel compared with carboplatin paclitaxel in the treatment of NSCLS during a 4 year period . The health outcome was the number of life years gained and quality adjusted life years obtained from the survival curves reported in a clinical study . Costs were estimated using national tariff and reported in US dollars at a date in 2019 . Costs and effectiveness outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5 per year . A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed on important parameters with a Monte Carlo simulation . The costs of BCP and CP were 30 341 and 11 735 respectively . The LYG for BCP and CP were 0.34 and 0.29 respectively . The QALY for BCP and CP were 0.27 and 0.23 . The ICER of BCP versus CP was 465 150 QALY . The results of the Monte Carlo simulation showed that CP was cost effective in 100 of the iterations compared with BCP . The addition of bevacizumab to the scheme carboplatin paclitaxel compared to carboplatin paclitaxel for NSCLC is not cost effective from the point of view of the Colombian health system .
1485,Physiotherapy in an adult intensive care unit affects health outcome . To justify the investment in ICU physical therapy the cost savings associated with its benefits need to be established . The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential cost savings of implementing 24 hour 7 days per week physiotherapist in a Chilean public high complex specialized ICU . Using clinical data from a literature review and a micro costing technique we conducted a cost benefit analysis in the National Institute of Thorax in Chile . Our example scenario involves 697 theoretical admissions of adult patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and the costs and benefits by reduction of length of stay in ICU days of mechanical ventilation and days with respiratory infections during the first year and 5 years of admissions . A sensitivity analysis was considered according to the variability in total costs production income and clinical benefits . Net cost savings generated in our example scenario demonstrate that the implementation of 24 7 PT produces a minimum saving for the institution of 16 242 during the first year and 69 351 over a 5 year interval considering individual income production . Out of the 30 scenarios included in the sensitivity analyses 26 demonstrated net savings . A financial model based on literature review and actual cost data projects that 24 7 PT intervention is a cost benefit alternative in adult ICU patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases in Chile . It is necessary a scenario of at least 3 sessions per day with insurance payment for individual treatments to support the long term implementation of a 24 7 PT program .
1486,It s estimated that 40 to 60 of patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee who do not receive thromboprophylaxis will develop deep venous thrombosis Instituto Nacional de Traumatologia e Ortopedia has established a guideline to prevent DVT with the administration of the Enoxaparin . Recently institute stakeholders have been questioning this guideline as new oral anticoagulants that offer more comfort and efficacy but present higher risk of bleeding have been appearing in the market for treating deep venous thrombosis . This study aims to validate the application of a multicriteria decision analysis in a real world problem the use of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis . The multicriteria method MACBETH was used in a decision conferencing process to develop an evaluation model for measuring the relative value of the drugs on each evaluation criterion separately and globally . The model building process was informed by a literature review and meta analysis of randomized clinical trials with a critical appraisal of the evidence . We report a model structure with eight criteria each one associated with a weighting coefficient and value function . Following a simple additive aggregation process the model outputs showed that Rivaroxaban was considered a robust option for DVT . Sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis were performed and testify the consistency of the results . This article contributes to literature by showing how MACBETH method can be combined with scientific evidence and participatory group processes for health technology assessment in hospitals .
1487,The aim of this study was to evaluate the federal government expenditures with oncological care for the most incident cancer types among the Brazilian population using registries of all patients treated by the Brazilian National Health Service between 2001 and 2015 . We adopted the formal healthcare sector perspective in this study with the costs per patient estimated by the reimbursement price paid by the Ministry of Health to service providers . The costs were adjusted by the follow up time for each patient . We performed multivariate regression analysis using ordinary least squares . We analyzed 952960 patients aged 19 years who underwent cancer treatment between 2001 and 2015 for breast prostate colorectal cervix lung and stomach cancers . The annual mean costs per patient was 9572.30 varying from 5782.10 for breast cancer to 16656 for cervical cancer . Several variables predicted higher costs of cancer treatment namely to be male with younger age ranges at treatment initiation resident in the Northeast region treated for colorectal cancer with treatment initiation from 2010 to 2014 tumor stages III and IV hospitalization for other reasons besides the cancer treatment and suffering from some a comorbidity . Given the forthcoming Brazilian demographic changes which strongly suggest that the economic burden of cancer is about to increase in the near future our estimates provide relevant information to produce useful projections about future cancer related costs .
1488,During coffee processing lactic acid bacteria from multiple ecosystems find in the cherry pulp a rich environment for their development . They utilize pulp substrate as a source of carbon and nitrogen to produce significant amounts of lactic acid . This natural fermentation is purposely used by coffee growers to promote an efficient removal of the mucilage layer adhering to the fruits before storage and transport of the coffee beans . Besides lactic acid LAB metabolism produces a variety of compounds from the utilization of citrate and the catabolism of amino acids . Recent studies have demonstrated that these metabolites have a complementary function in the formation of taste and flavor precursors of coffee beverages . However the possibility of improving coffee quality by the use of LAB has largely been ignored . This review considers the importance of LAB associated with coffee processing exploring their diversity and metabolism and influences on coffee quality . The selection of appropriate LAB strains alone or in combination with yeasts is a promising research line in a near future leading to new perspectives on coffee quality .
1489,Fish industry has been growing continuously over the last decades and generates huge amounts of by products . These by products come from fish head skin bones thorns and viscera . Part of them are processed for feed collagen and oil production and to a lesser extent to produce biofuels and fertilizers but many other high value bioactive compounds can be recovered .

1536,Increasing the efficiency and safety of battery management systems may require internal monitoring of lithium ion batteries . In this work we present an analysis of the interaction between fiber optic evanescent wave sensors and graphite particles within a lithium ion battery over multiple cycles . Through slow charging and long rest periods the FOEWS signal has shown sensitivity to lithium concentration at the surface of graphite particles by demonstrating a response to the slow diffusion of lithium ions within graphite particles during rest periods . The slope of the FOEWS signal during a full charge is found to exhibit three distinct peaks that occur within lithiated graphite s stage transitions zones IV III and II . Deviation from the observed three peak trend correlates with significant battery capacity fade and thus indicate the sensors ability to detect capacity fade in real time . During experiments significant deviations in the slope during charging occurred at about 5 SOC and minor disturbances to the slope were observed at 80 SOC which supports limiting the depth of charge and discharge to avoid accelerated capacity fade . These results deepen our understanding of the FOEWS s interaction with lithium ion batteries and supports the development of algorithms that optimize the control and monitoring of graphite lithiation with the aim of achieving safer operation as well as maximizing capacity and battery life .

1547,The high energy density characteristic of the all solid state battery technology makes it one of the promising competitors of current liquid electrolyte based lithium ion batteries . However due to the low ionic conductivity of solid materials and existing issues in active material solid electrolyte interfaces all solid state batteries show strong nonlinear behavior when the amplitude of input current is relatively high . In this paper we have developed a methodology based on block oriented nonlinear systems that can detect quantize and model the battery behavior accurately . For this purpose two solid state coin cells which have different ionic conductivity at the cathode interface are manufactured and excited with multisine input current . The Best Linear Approximation method has been used to separate linear frequency response function from nonlinear distortion . Then a Hammerstein Wiener system has been developed and parametrized to model the nonlinear distortions caused by ionic conductivity variation of the solid electrolyte at the cathode layer . Furthermore the developed model has been utilized to detect possible faults in the electrode electrolyte interface based on the nonlinearity level of the measured voltage .

1557,Uncertainty a familiar concept for power system operators has been set to be one of important topics in the industry of electricity systems . This circumstance is mainly caused by uncertain behavior of some parameters like price . Since the forecasting techniques are usually unable to guarantee a fixed and accurate value of such parameters therefore uncertainty modeling becomes essential . This work has applied an interval based optimization model for optimal performances of intelligent parking lot of electric vehicles within severe uncertainty of upper grid price under demand response program . In fact DRP is used to enable IPL reduce its daily operation cost by shifting some parts of load demand from peak time intervals to off peak time intervals . It should be mentioned that interval approach does not solve single objective problem and instead of that it generates a multi objective optimization problem within which average and deviation costs are minimized as the bi objective model . To do this weighted sum and fuzzy approached are applied to solve the bi objective problem . A sample system containing IPL local dispatchable generation units non renewable and renewable generation systems is studied under uncertainty of upper grid price through mentioned techniques and the results proving efficiency of employed techniques are investigated for comparison . According to the compared results under DRP average cost of IPL is reduced up to 4.37 while deviation cost representing uncertainty impact is also decreased up to 10.93 .

1567,Aging of lithium ion pouch cells causes significant cell thickness growth and can consequently lead to high loads onto the cell stack and module frame in automotive application . In order to investigate force evolution and its interaction with aging cells must be cycled under mechanically representative bracing conditions .

1568,This work presents the first use of Cofalit as a solid filler in pilot scale thermocline thermal energy storage . The thermocline size is 4 m connected to the MicroSol R installation at the PROMES research facility in Odeillo France . The study compares the thermal performance of the thermocline filled with Cofalit to the reference case of alumina spheres for typical charge and discharge operations . It evaluates the actual thermal behavior of thermocline considering three leading performance indicators process duration thermocline thickness and process efficiency . The investigation shows a 22 shorter charge duration in Cofalit compared to alumina and 16 shorter discharge duration . Cofalit exhibits about 16 lower thermocline thickness during both charge and discharge compared to alumina . The charge efficiency is slightly better in Cofalit than alumina with an efficiency of 82 and 78 respectively . Also Cofalit has a better discharge efficiency 90 with respect to 84 for alumina . These results confim a good thermal performance of Cofalit as filler material in thermocline TES . Considering the cost saving and positive environmental impact of using Cofalit as well as the good thermal performance of the thermocline filled with it Cofalit appears a very good filler material in TES . The obtained temperatures from radial positions indicate no significant variation during charge and discharge and this confirms the one dimensional thermal behavior of this setup . A parametric analysis is performed using a 1D continuous solid model to investigate the influence of particle diameter porosity thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity on the thermal performance of the thermocline . The analysis confirms the experimental findings and it indicates that about a 10.9 longer process duration is associated with a 10 larger volumetric heat capacity and less affected with other parameters . Thermocline thickness is mainly affected by the diameter as well as the volumetric heat capacity of the solid filler it grows 2.2 for each 10 diameter increase and around 3.23 for doubling the volumetric heat capacity . Charge efficiency demonstrates independency from evaluated properties . While discharge efficiency increases sharply at a tiny particle diameter before an optimum diameter value is reached then it starts to decrease by 1.4 to each 10 bigger diameter .

1574,The excellent electrical and mechanical properties of graphene make it a promising electrode material for energy storage devices such as supercapacitors . However graphene flakes tend to restack upon processing which lowers the inner electrode surface area that contacts the electrolyte . We report on a straightforward and scalable approach where we add a chemical leavening agent to suppress the restacking of printed and reduced graphene oxide flakes resulting in a significant enhancement of the electrode capacitance . Upon mild heating the leavening agent releases gasses that rise the gaps between rGO flakes and hence increase the surface area that is accessible for the electrolyte . We also optimize ink and micro dispensing process that is utilized to print such risen rGO electrodes . The supercapacitor characterization indicates that the capacitance enhancement strongly depends on the size of the GO flakes sizes on the order of magnitude of microns are most suitable .

1578,The free convective flow of a Nano Encapsulated Phase Change Material suspension in an eccentric annulus is investigated numerically . The inner cylinder is heated and kept at a temperature higher than that of the outer cylinder . The core of the NEPCM particles is made of nonadecane while the shell is made of Polyurethane . The nanoparticles are dispersed in water as the base fluid . The equations governing the flow and heat transfer of the NEPCM suspension in the annulus are developed and written in the non dimensional form . The numerical solutions of these equations are obtained using the finite element method . The validity of the numerical method is ensured by comparing its predictions to the results of previously published studies . The main outcomes point out to the impact of the volume fraction of the NEPCM particles and Stefan number on the thermal and hydrodynamic characteristics of the suspension . A 5 volume fraction represents the optimal value for heat transfer enhancement . Heat transfer is also enhanced when the fusion temperature of the NEPCM core is far from the temperatures of the hot and cold walls .

We also investigated the effect of different devices including a recycle blower and ejector . Our results showed that fuel recirculation increases the overall round trip efficiency up to 6.0 points when waste steam is at 500C . However recirculation at the highest temperature did not lead to the highest efficiency improvement in the ejector systems . Instead the warm ejector configuration our intermediate temperature case resulted in the highest efficiency . Furthermore the warm ejector configuration showed efficiencies close to those of the blower system at a wide range of operating current densities . We also determined a range of external heat source temperatures that is favorable or workable for specific ejector system configurations so that the fuel recirculation configuration could be designed accordingly to achieve best performance .

1582,Low thermal conductivity is a significant issue for the deployment of phase change based thermal energy stores . A structured methodology is required to find the best overall design in order to assess its techno economic feasibility . In this study the optimised structural configuration of graphite composites for this purpose are first considered from three different perspectives using both experimental measurements and numerical simulations . Both steady state and dynamic performance are taken into account with the latter being considered both with and without phase change . In all three cases it is demonstrated that thin parallel graphite sheets offer the most optimal results compared to other options . Resulting in the highest composite thermal conductivity measured to date at a loading of 3.5mass . The next step in achieving the best overall performance is the optimisation of this composite in the context of a plate and frame heat exchanger . For this purpose a simplified analytical model of this configuration was developed and validated . This was used in conjunction with the log mean temperature difference approach to optimise the exchanger for two typical applications low temperature low duty and high temperature high duty . The results indicate that even under an idealised configuration the system will only be suitable for high temperature applications with gas heat transfer fluids and short discharge times . For low temperature applications it may be possible to use liquid heat transfer fluids but also only for short discharge times . From an economic perspective the range of graphite sheets currently available on the market will have to be reduced in cost by two or more orders of magnitude in order to be cost effective .

The mechanism of how particle size influences the phase transition route of novel leady oxides during soaking process is investigated . PbO with larger particle size is converted to 3PbOPbSO4 and 3PbOPbSO4 is then partially transformed to PbOPbSO4 while PbOPbSO4 are gradually converted to PbSO4 . PbO with smaller particle size is directly converted to PbSO4 and 3PbOPbSO4 is partially transformed to PbOPbSO4 . Phase compositions after the soaking process determine the PbO2 content in positives plates because PbO2 is the oxidation product of PbSO4 in the sequent formation process . Particle size of leady oxides determines the initial capacity of testing cells through affecting the soaking process and a linear correlation between the initial capacity and PbO2 content in positive plates is obtained .

1588,Nowadays lithium ion batteries are increasingly spreading in different areas and therefore it is very important to understand their aging behavior . According to the technical literature battery aging can be dissociated in calendar aging and cycle aging . Calendar aging in particular depends on the temperature and state of charge . In addition to the previous factors cycle aging also depends on the current rate and charge discharge cut off voltages . In the literature only a few papers have considered battery aging as a function of the charge discharge current rate but they agree that a higher current rate leads to faster battery aging . In any case all of the tests have been conducted in a climactic chamber with a constant room temperature . However even if the room temperature is controlled for high current rates the temperature of the battery cell increases which makes it impossible to distinguish the aging due to the current from that due to the temperature . For this reason in the present work the authors focused on the lithium ion battery aging due to the current rate while maintaining a constant battery temperature using opportunely controlled Peltier cells . In this way an interesting results was obtained i.e . the cycle aging is not dependent on the current rate .
1589,The sensible thermal energy storage system proposed in the present study is composed by a set of flat parallel plates and is meant to work as a thermal rectifier continuously powered by a cyclical thermal stream in order to retrieve a conditioned output . The energy storage system is modeled by a lumped element model but its accurateness needed to be ascertained . Computational fluid dynamic is used as a reference modeling to assess the lumped model deviations following a Design of Experiments planning performed by the BoxBehnken method . Nine controlled and independent parameters are identified to operate the energy storage system equally representative of the heat storage material the plate geometry and the working fluid . The temporal evolution of the fluid temperature at the system discharge is used to observe the amplitude and phase deviations in respect to reference modeling . Amplitude deviations are found to be below 6 and phase deviations below 4 for 130 simulated cases assigned by the BoxBehnken method . Heat conduction along the plate axial direction is prevailing in respect to the transversal transfer meaning that significant deviations from the lumped model to the reference one are only noticed when the storage system combines high values for the number of transfer units and the plate thermal conductivity . The present study shows that thermal energy storage systems like the one proposed in this paper can be simulated with lumped element models .

1594,It has previously been proven that fins can significantly enhance the thermal performance of latent heat thermal energy storage units . Nevertheless the magnitude of improvement especially in a horizontal LHTS is still less than that required to address some of the existing challenges in solar energy applications . The tendency of the phase change material at the bottom of the horizontal storage to remain solid because of the absence of convection currents to promote heat transfer must be tackled practically for this technology to be viable in different thermal applications . Thus the fin configuration around the circumference of the horizontal storage must be optimised to enhance the melting rate and therefore improving efficiency .
1595,Available energy and available capacity are key factors for dimensioning batteries . Discharge duration of a battery and its dependency on discharge current amplitude are well described by Peukerts law from low to medium current ranges . Other equations describe this dependency up to very high current rates including the currents occurring during a short circuit . It is not current and capacity but energy and power which are the key parameters for dimensioning battery systems . Thus the available power of battery cells vs. the discharge duration was investigated from low to high constant power discharge loads . Based on the results of these experiments a correlation of the maximum discharge duration for low to medium discharge power pulses similar to the Peukerts equation was found . Additionally a new equation is proposed describing the power range from low to very high discharge power rates .

1599,This paper reports the influence of fin configurations in a SS PCM based thermal control module . The materials considered are Layered perovskite as SS PCM and Aluminium for the heat sink . Taguchi optimization integrated numerical simulations are carried out to study the effect of fin shape fin thickness base thickness and total number of fins for a constant heat flux of 10W at 1200s on 4800s off duty cycles of an avionic component under orbital conditions . The ANOVA results determined the contribution factor of each parameter . For a fixed geometry simulation results exhibit better heat transfer in square straight fin configuration and achieved a lower heat sink base temperature of 1.3 and 0.5K than the circular and triangular straight fin configuration which also proves to be in good agreement with the aspect ratio of the fins . However triangular fins performed better and had a mass reduction of 25 and 35 than square and circular counterparts at constant volume fraction leading to substantial cost savings . Also the tapered fin configurations were more effective in reducing the base temperature by 0.6K and thereby enhancing faster heat transfer than their straight counterparts . In conclusion the tapered triangular fin configuration is suitable for SS PCM based thermal control module for satellite avionics .

1602,Wind power integration with high penetration in a power system is indispensable . However wind power integration especially with high level raises the power system instability problems due to its natural variability and unpredictability which increases system uncertainties . Thus uncertainties and correlations amongst wind farms should be considered in a power system operation and planning . One of the best solutions for facilitating the wind power integration is the installation of an energy storage system . However the location and sizing of ESSs should be optimally planned to achieve maximum benefits such as minimising total cost time shifting reliability and power quality enhancement minimising power loss improving the power factor and providing environmental support . In this paper a new probabilistic discretising method is derived and developed to discretise the continuous joint power distribution of correlated wind farms . Combining the new probabilistic discretising method with a multi objective hybrid particle swarm optimisation and non dominated sorting genetic algorithm a new hybrid probabilistic optimisation algorithm is proposed . The proposed hybrid algorithm aims to search for the best location and size of energy storage system and considers the power uncertainties of multi correlated wind farms . The objective functions to be minimised include a system s total expected cost restricted by investment budget total expected voltage deviation and total expected carbon emission . IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 57 bus systems are adopted to perform the case studies using the proposed hybrid probabilistic optimisation algorithm .

The study also put forward the optimized proportion of biochar and PCM in hybrid thermal energy storage material . The new material shows superior thermal conductivity over pure PCM as well as better stability due to the high carbon content and porosity of the developed biochar . Simple Impregnation method has been used to prepare form stable composite material which has good thermal and structural stability . The best mixing ratio is found to be 6 4 with minimum leakage of PCM from the composite . The sample prepared through this method yield all the desirable properties as compared to other developed samples . The chemical properties of the composite remain the same as the pure PCM which confirms no chemical interaction between the PCM and biochar . The heat of fusion is calculated to be 179.4J g. The thermal conductivity of the PCM is enhanced up to 13.82 times with the addition of water hyacinth biochar as a supporting matrix . The addition of aluminum metal powder further increases the thermal conductivity by 17.27 times higher than that of PCM alone .

1610,Large scale energy storage systems such as underground pumped storage hydropower plants are required in the current energy transition to variable renewable energies to balance supply and demand of electricity . In this paper a novel method to determinate the round trip energy efficiency in pumped storage hydropower plants with underground lower reservoir is presented . Two Francis pump turbines with a power output of 124.9 and 214.7 MW and a power input of 114.8 and 199.7MW respectively have been selected to investigate the overall operation of UPSH plants . Analytical models and two phase 3D CFD numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the energy generated and consumed considering a typical water mass of 450 000 t and a maximum gross pressure of 4.41MPa . The results obtained in both analytical and numerical models show that unlike conventional pumped storage hydropower plants the round trip energy efficiency depends on the pressure inside the underground reservoir . The round trip energy efficiency could be reduced from 77.3 to 73.8 when the reservoir pressure reaches 100kPa . In terms of energy balance the energy generation decreases down to 3 639MWh
1611,Prediction of state of charge is critical to the reliability and durability of battery systems in electric vehicles .

The training results from a yearlong dataset show that the offline LSTM based model can perform fast and accurate multi forward step prediction for battery SOC . Furthermore the model has excellent practical application effects by taking into account weather and drivers driving behaviors during real vehicular operating and the stability flexibility and robustness of this method are verified by 10 fold cross validation . In order to achieve dual control of prediction accuracy and prediction horizon we proposed an LRLSTM based joint prediction strategy while using LSTM and multiple linear regression algorithms through which an accuracy benchmark can be obtained and the prediction steps of LSTM within acceptable accuracy can be flexibly controlled . The smooth implementation of multi forward step SOC prediction on real word vehicles can eliminate drivers mileage anxiety and safeguard vehicle operation in a big way .
1612,Metal foams have been extensively studied to enhance the performance of the Phase Change Materials based Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage systems . The studies in the literature are primarily focused on analyzing the effect of specific metal foam on the heat transfer augmentation and lacks comprehensive analysis . The present study aims to understand the interdependent effect of thermophysical properties of PCM and metal foam system geometry and operating condition on the potential of metal foams to enhance phase change processes . Besides the studies are limited to analyze the effect of metal foam addition on phase change processes inside predefined geometries which fails to consider the reduction in the thermal capacity as the void volume available for the PCM decreases upon the addition of low porosity metal foam . It is crucial to maintain the constant thermal capacity of the LHTES system from both an application and a fundamental analysis perspective . Therefore in the present study the dimensions of the LHTES systems are altered to maintain the thermal capacity of the systems which changes when metal foams are added . Empirical correlations are developed to estimate the effect of embedding metal foam in PCM on the solidification process of PCM in both constant volume and constant thermal capacity systems . These correlations are validated using numerical results and the differences are limited to within 1 and 1.6 for the solidification time and average heat flux respectively . The correlations can be extended to unidirectional melting processes with minor modifications and it reduces reliance on experimental and numerical analysis .

Reversible solid oxide cells can be fruitfully integrated within renewable microgrids thus providing an effective solution to the mismatch between energy demand and production from renewable sources . The objective of this work is the development of a modeling tool enabling both optimal sizing and proper year through energy management of an rSOC based renewable microgrid supplying electricity and hydrogen to a residential complex and a passenger car fleet consisting of both electric and fuel cell vehicles . This innovative multiple load energy system entails developing suitable modeling tools to properly account for the randomness of both renewable energy production and load demand the latter being treated via historical data and Monte Carlo based procedures . To this aim both hydrogen and thermal storage systems are involved in the plant design whereas their charge sustaining management here adopted to guarantee self sufficiency features as required by robust and resilient distributed systems are addressed through suited constraints . The resulting constrained optimization tool yields both design data and control guidelines which can serve as a basis for subsequent development of low level control strategies as well as the refined design of grid connected rSOC based microgrids . A techno economic assessment shows that the payback period is reasonable ranging between 6 and 10 years depending on the rSOC cost scenario .

The results were extremely small capacity losses after more than a year of testing but significant amounts of underlying silent degradations with incubation periods . The impact of these silent degradations was quantified and used to forecast 20 year usage . They were shown to induce in some cases an acceleration of the capacity loss after as low as 6 years of deployment .
1620,In this study the porous bamboo material was obtained by removing the intercalated substance between the fibers through a simple delignification process and was used as support matrix by impregnating a reversible thermochromic compound to prepare a shape stable bamboo based composite reversible thermochromic phase change material . Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and X ray diffraction analysis of bamboo and DB showed that lignin was removed from bamboo by the delignification process . The open porous structure founded in scanning electron microscopy micrographs allows the rapid impregnation of TBB to achieve reversible thermochromic and phase change storage properties . The reduction in surface roughness and contact angle leads to an increase in the hydrophilicity of the DB for the subsequent impregnation of the TBB into the porous structure of DB .

1621,A new effective thermal conductivity model is proposed for full tank simulation including the effect of the different densities of the solid PCM and liquid PCM . Firstly the proposed model was validated for one capsule and then for one column with four layers of capsules . Further it was extended to a thermal storage tank composed of 9920 capsules in a simple cubic arrangement . Dissimilar melting behavior was observed depending on the different positions of the capsules in the tank which illustrated the importance of simulating the entire tank . Also because of the density difference between the liquid and solid PCM the movement of solid PCM results in contact melting which enhances melting speed compared with that of constrained melting . The validation result for the proposed unconstrained effective thermal conductivity model for single capsule showed root mean square error of 0.008 with respect to the refined numerical model . The constrained melting model highly under estimated the melting speed compared to the unconstrained melting model . The two main obstacles to accurately estimating the performance of thermal storage systems were overcome by the proposed model .

Storage dispatch strategies are explored using production cost and price taker models to address two related research questions will storage assets receive the highest remuneration by bidding into DA markets bidding into RT markets or redispatching bids in both markets and how accurate must forecast information be for a redispatch strategy to improve remuneration Results show that with sufficient ability to forecast prices redispatching a DA schedule in the RT takes advantage of both markets a longer dispatch horizon as well as more volatile prices .
1623,The use of biomimetic red blood cell shaped capsules for latent heat thermal storage is a novel concept . The RBC shape provides a much higher heat transfer rate than that of other shapes . However the heat transfer characteristics of external flows around RBC shaped capsules and the optimal attack angle are unknown . In the present work forced convection of external flows over an RBC shaped PCM capsule was numerically studied in a steady state laminar flow region with Reynolds number in the range of 20200 and compared to that of a conventional spherical capsule . Moreover the local Nusselt number surface average Nusselt number and drag coefficient at various Reynolds numbers and attack angles of RBC shaped capsules were investigated . The surface average Nusselt number of the RBC shaped capsule was found slightly smaller than that of the spherical capsule with a maximum disparity of 12.04 . The drag coefficient of the RBC and spherical capsule both decreased with the increase of Reynolds number and the disparity between them was very small . 0 attack angle was recommended for the RBC shaped capsule layout as it had the lowest drag force with a relatively high average Nusselt number .

1631,In this study the authors developed an electric cordless impact driver with an Li ion capacitor pack as an energy storage device . At first an equivalent circuit of the LIC was established . The equivalent circuit comprised a single resistance single capacitor and single resister capacitor parallel circuit . It was found that the established equivalent circuit was useful for simulation as has been conducted in the development of some products using LICs as energy storage equipment . Before starting the development of the electric cordless impact driver with its LIC pack the topology of the LIC pack was determined . Next a design simulation of a rapid charger for the LIC pack installed on the cordless electric impact driver was carried out by using the equivalent circuit . From this simulation the operational behavior of the rapid charger designed in this study could be confirmed and the authors were able to build upon the development base of the rapid charger . Based on the experience the rapid charger was assembled for the LIC pack . Using the rapid charger a test of rapid charging of the LIC pack was carried out . From the test it was confirmed that the development of the rapid charger for the LIC pack had been successfully achieved since the charging operation performed during the test was as shown in the simulation . Subsequently demonstration tests of screw tightening were executed using the cordless electric impact driver with the LIC pack . Throughout the tests it was evident that the cordless electric impact driver with the LIC pack can be used to tighten screws with lengths of 75mm and 90mm . In addition the cordless electric impact driver with the LIC pack offers enhanced comfort to users due to the reduced net weight of the energy storage device . These results reveal that the impact driver is a suitable candidate for applications in which the LIC is integrated as an energy storage device . Therefore the findings of this study may contribute to an expansion of applications that use an LIC and promote the further development of electric tools with novel energy storage systems .

1637,Modern tendencies together with growing consciousness about the negative environmental influence of the transportation technologies have yielded electric vehicles as one of the approaches for phasing out fuel based vehicles . Different directives aimed at increasing demand for electric vehicles have been put in place however due to different reasons initial predictions resulted in an insufficient number of sold units and suboptimal solutions like hybrid vehicles . Consequently the reduction in fuel consumption and pollution generation is insignificant on a global scale . The main deficiency of the electric vehicle is its battery based storage unit which due to the current state of development makes the electric vehicle less admissible for consumers . Relatively short cycle life high sensitivity to ambient conditions environmental hazards and relatively limited output power are only some of the deficiencies of the current battery technology . However a novel type of electric storage technology has recently emerged as a promising long term complement to the battery technology . Long cycle life huge power density and no environmental hazards make supercapacitor technology a viable and assuring addition to the battery storage . Furthermore supercapacitors may offer the possibility of making the electric vehicle more competitive on the market as well as a more sustainable solution . Although the supercapacitor technology is still considered to be immature and more research is needed this paper examines the possibilities and effects of using supercapacitors as part of the electric vehicle energy storage . The main goal is the analysis of the positive effects that the supercapacitor storage can have on the battery cycle life as well as on the electric vehicle performance and economy . Conclusions drawn from the herein presented research are based on the theoretical analysis numerical models and experimental verification therefore it can be confirmed that using supercapacitors as a part of electric vehicle energy storage substantial improvements in performance durability and economy could be achieved .

1641,The microgrid system with a high share of Renewable Energy Sources is the need of hour . The RES provides clean economical and never ending active power support to the system . However the inertia deficiency is the negative side of RES based systems as it adversely affects the dynamic performance of the microgrid and may lead to severe consequences like loss of synchronization and instability . For addressing the issue of inertia deficiency several techniques were already proposed for emulating the virtual inertia . Among these the Derivative Control Technique is quite popular because of its simplicity and effectiveness . The previous research work utilizes the Energy Storage System for providing virtual inertia support through DCT during load imbalance . However such a system neglects the possibility of extracting virtual inertia support obtained from RES . This paper proposes a novel technique for tapping the virtual inertia potential of RES by cultivating the the derivative control mechanism and further improves the dynamic performance of the system . Further the efficiency of the proposed system is evaluated through time domain simulations under different scenarios and compare it with conventional and ESS based systems .
1642,Today knowledge of battery energy storage systems has experienced a rapid growth resulting to the numerous grid applications . The utility scale batteries assembled in containers can be transported in the grid . Despite numerous benefits this feature has been overlooked . In previous studies battery movement is modeled based on a specific transfer method such as a truck or train . Accordingly by changing the method of transporting the battery the problem should be re modeled and also it is not possible to schedule the battery movements by combining two transfer methods . In this context this paper proposes a new battery movement scheduling in the distribution networks . To this end optimal charging or discharging power in addition to the bus location will be determined for any time period of operation . In the proposed model only distance between buses is important and how the battery is transferred is not important . accordingly battery transfer may be performed using one transmission method such as a truck or a combination of two methods . Reactive power contribution by the battery power losses and bus voltages of the network are also counted by maintaining linear structure of the model . This guarantees practical application of the formulation for the real life distribution grids . Results of implementing the model on a test system indicate distinct superiority of the mobile BESS with respect to the stationary installations .

An obvious domino phenomenon with a chain like increase in temperature rise and propagation speed could be observed during the thermal failure propagation process . The temperature of the cell surface is about 700 1000 C during the combustion process . Several cells burned simultaneously and exacerbated the burning rate resulting in the larger mass loss rate and the heat release rate for the larger battery pack .

1655,Phase change materials have been widely applied in thermal energy storage while its applications are quite limited due to the long melting time . In the present work the metallic 2 dimensional porous structure was probed for shortening the melting time . For straightforward prediction of melting time a theoretical formula was firstly developed in this work which matches the numerical results well . Then the influences of various structure characters on the heat transfer were analyzed including the heat transfer direction pore size pore geometry and volume fraction . Results turn out that to obtain relatively short melting time the heat transfer direction should be parallel to the axis of the copper pore and the pore size should be larger than 500nm but smaller than 1mm . The composite at nanoscale is a better choice than that at macroscale due to their larger heat storage density . In the manufacture the pore geometry with a large sphericity is preferable for shortening melting time . This study is expected to supply some information for the selection of proper structures for a thermal energy storage system to reduce melting time .

1659,This study proposed a novel approach to optimize size and cost of hybrid energy storage systems based on a solar photovoltaic fed stand alone DC microgrid while considering the state of charge of both batteries and supercapacitors to assure the long life of batteries and well being during the operation . The sizing strategy is combined with an optimization model and a HESS Assessment Algorithm . The strategy differs from traditional strategies since it comprises of not only the system cost but also SOC regulation of both batteries and supercapacitors . A unique penalty cost function depending on the unutilized solar power generation and unserved demand power after HESS is fully charged or discharged has been introduced . By this penalty cost function SOC of HESS can be kept within a safer margin to guarantee the system stability . Also system availability can be assured by penalizing the unserved demand power . A new SOC regulation concept for supercapacitors has been introduced . SOC of supercapacitors is maintained in between a predefined focused band to ensure the supercapacitors availability to absorb or deliver sudden power fluctuations . The lifetime of HESS and the solar PV system are considered in the objective function to find the optimum sizing of HESS . The simulation was performed under Hambantota Solar Park weather conditions using MATLAB . Multi objective genetic algorithm is used to optimize the objective functions . Comparing with a traditional sizing method it shows that the novel optimal sizing strategy can reduce the BS system capacity by 18 by the hybridization of supercapacitors . The best value for the energy ratio between supercapacitors and batteries for the considered load profile was found to be 25 . Results prove that the number of penalties surplus solar power generations and unserved demand power were made minimum while obtaining an optimal sizing of HESS with a minimum system investment cost .
1660,In the existing literature the importance of control methods used to manage the operation of thermal energy storage systems increased in the last years .

1664,Hybrid energy storage systems have attracted more and more interests due to their improved performances compared with sole energy source in system efficiency and battery lifetime . This study aims to propose a real time energy management control strategy for achieving these goals . The strategy is based on a combination of wavelet transform neural network and fuzzy logic . Wavelet transform is an effective tool in extracting different frequency components of load power demand to match the characteristics of battery and supercapacitor . However it is hard to be directly applied in a real time system . For this a neural network model which is offline trained using the dataset obtained from the wavelet transform decomposition is developed to online predict the low frequency power demand for the battery . Accordingly the high frequency power demand is online calculated and distributed to the supercapacitor . In addition a fuzzy logic based supervisory controller is further developed for controlling the supercapacitor voltage within a certain suitable range . Finally a 72V battery and 96V supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system real time hardware platform has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed energy management control strategy .
1665,Incorporation of phase change materials in construction materials increases thermal mass of the buildings and reduces diurnal daily fluctuations of indoor air temperature . Direct impregnation is a cheap and easy method to embed PCM into the wood . The main shortcoming of this way is that the amount PCM is depleting over time that leads to degradation of the structure thermal mass and its capacity to store heat . In addition the presence of PCM in construction materials increases the flammability of the structures . In this study ultraviolet curable coating was used to improve containment of RT21 and propyl ester in wood and to reduce its flammability . Long exposure to storage temperature of 50 C and room ambient temperature indicated that significant improvement was achieved in PCM retention in the wood through UV coating on the wood surface . Blending ammonium polyphosphate into the lacquer improved fire safety of the PCM impregnated wood as indicated by reduced ignition time and heat release rate from cone calorimeter test . Reduction in peak heat release rate by 20.5 and 37.4 was observed in RT21 and propyl ester respectively .

Beyond the common use of voltage or current measurements which have proved unsuccessful as general methods we aim to determine battery ageing in terms of irreversible entropy production . On the one hand entropy describes transformations such as ageing and on the other hand entropy combines the benefits of voltage current and temperature effects in a single magnitude . We develop a thermoelectrochemical model based on phenomenological equations to compute entropy generation rates as a function of internal parameters such as concentration electrode porosity and conduction in NiMH batteries . We simulate ageing by changing internal parameters during battery cycling and we found a threshold in the entropy generation rate of 0.12 mW K

However the improper inlet outlet manifolds may cause the strong mixing of hot and cold fluids and disturb the temperature stratification resulting in reduced thermal performances of the storage tank .
1668,Along with the rapid development of pumped hybrid storage in China the shortage of inland resources has become a serious problem that restricts its further development . Fortunately seawater pumped hybrid storage processes the advantages in saving cost of lower reservoir construction and making full use of coastal resources which has attracted great attention in China .

1671,The deployment of distributed behind the meter batteries operating on a peak shaving mode could benefit the electricity network by providing optimal and location specific services increasing the penetration of intermittent renewable sources and deferring costly network upgrades . However the quantitative assessment of the benefits of load peak shaving and its impact on the distribution network remains a challenge . The present paper introduces a metric of five indexes to evaluate the technical performances of load peak shaving . This metric is applied on a case study based on a photovoltaic and battery system application for a test house in Northern Ireland whose electricity demand is representative of the average UK demand profile . Two peak shaving strategies are compared with a more usual self consumption mode and the impact of the battery size is evaluated . Peak shaving management strategies show promising performance by reducing peaks by more than 98 while still decreasing the yearly consumption by 15 and avoiding 75 of the photovoltaic generated energy to be exported back to the grid . The economic analysis compared the net present values achieved under two different tariff policies . Using a peak shaving incentivising tariff remunerating customers 0.24 per kWh of peak shaved allowed to maintain profitability with a capacity cost of up to 400 kWh compared to only 150 kWh for a usual flat tariff scheme . Such an incentive is a step forward in promoting customers to purchase a larger battery and to operate it in a way that benefits the grid operator .

1674,The usage patterns of EVs is a great concern in Shanghai as the city with the largest number of EVs . Their usage patterns are investigated based on time series association and segmentation of historical static EV data from the real world . The results show that both BEV and PHEV are mostly used as commuting vehicles with an average speed of EVs of less than 25km h and about 80 of EVs travel within 60km per day . Although there is no big difference between the speed of EVs and other models during the morning and evening rush hours low speed EVs have a significant environmental advantage over fuel vehicles . About 30 EVs have a relatively concentrated charging time between 21 0024 00 while PHEVs with small battery capacity still present a small charging peak at about 9 00 in the morning in order to continue to travel with electricity on the way home . The charging locations in urban center are more intensive than those in suburban areas and EVs are charged more frequently in summer than in winter . It is necessary to optimize the layout of charging piles and orderly charging of EVs in the case of no capacity expansion of power transmission and distribution lines . The actual electricity consumption per 100km of BEV or PHEV is greater than that provided by the manufacturer due to air conditioning energy consumption and complex driving conditions . The results are helpful to promote the development of EVs and layout of charging piles .

An experimental analysis of air compression using liquid piston is proposed for chambers with big dimensions which leads to the development of several correlations . From these assessments it is possible to describe the presence of two different convective heat exchange patterns as well as the liquid piston position in the transition between them . A numerical model is developed by employing these correlations . The comparison between numerical and experimental results enables the validation of such correlations for a specific set of parameters .

Therefore a fast battery capacity estimation method based on open circuit voltage estimation is forthwith proposed . The method calculates capacity using the ratio of the change in electric quantity to the corresponding change in state of charge and the SOC is estimated via a fast OCV estimation method proposed in this paper . The fast test procedure includes a charging discharging test and a short rest which take less than 30 minutes in total and provide the data for the battery capacity estimation . For estimation a weighted voltage relaxation model containing two parallel resistorcapacitor components is established . Its parameters are then optimized using the beetle antenna search algorithm with the approximate OCV range obtained in the test and an early voltage relaxation curve . The results of the experiments show that the proposed model and algorithm can accurately estimate the OCV and the capacity estimation can be quickly realized in half an hour while limiting inaccuracy to less than 3 .

1760,Organosilicon substances are ubiquitous in the environment due to their stability and numerous applications in consumer products . Therefore it is desirable to reduce their environmental persistency . Our study aimed to better understand the impact of silicon atoms in organic compounds on their environmental biodegradability as a contribution to sustainable chemistry . Accordingly we investigated the biodegradability of organosilicon compounds and their carbon analogues . OECD 301D test was used to assess ready biodegradability . In addition GC MS analyses were performed to study the fate of the compounds in the test . Three out of five carbon compounds and no organosilicon compound were found readily biodegradable . In all but one case higher biodegradation degrees could be observed for the carbon compounds . Hydrolysis was identified as a mandatory step prior to the biodegradation of organosilicon substances . The silicon free product of hydrolysis determined the rate of biodegradation . The silicon containing reaction products of hydrolysis were not biodegradable . The high biodegradability of one organosilicon compound can be attributed to faster hydrolysis due to an easily hydrolysable SiN bond and a high biodegradation rate of the resulting silicon free hydrolysis product . Insertion of such heteroatoms or functional groups into polysiloxane chains may be a promising approach to benign organosilicon compounds .

1765,In this research our main concern is to address that fluorosis as a global health issue and to provide an affordable diagnostic probe to detect the unhealthy concentration of fluoride in water that causes it . In this context we have used chitosan with 85 deacetylation as a matrix to stabilize the nanoparticles for fluoride detection . The sensing probe based on a nano architecture imparts evident green color to the solution by encountering with fluoride ion in aqueous with bathochromic shift of 320nm .

1767,Misregulated chromatin remodeling via erroneous histone acetylation has been linked with multiple diseases including many age associated maladies . Previous studies on histone acetylation have utilized specific histone acetylation antibodies as a primary quantification tool . However antibodies that target specific histone modifications frequently lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity making signal quantification and data interpretation difficult . Here we used mass spectrometry to quantify the acetylation patterns of histone H4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human patients of varying age . We observed that mono acetylation of H4K16ac is lower in midlife human PBMCs and that various changes occur in the H4 acetylation signature using PBMCs prepared from old patients . Our data corroborates previous work suggesting that ageing might be characterized by specific changes in the acetylation states of histone H4 and shows that targeted mass spectrometry together with appropriate quantification methods can be used to sensitively measure such changes .
1768,Mass spectral data from multiple samples are suitable for a hypothesis free development of clinically useful multivariate tests using modern machine learning techniques . However the transition from discovery to adoption of proteomic tests has proved challenging . Slow adoption of these tests in clinical practice is in part related to insufficient understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying multivariate tests developed based on correlative studies . While identification of individual proteins may provide important insights elucidation of concerted relationships of sets of proteins with biological pathways can better reflect complex phenomena such as cancerogenesis and response to treatment . Protein set enrichment analysis allows identification of associations of mass spectral features or test classifications with biological function by looking for consistent correlations across a group of proteins .

1771,2 hydroxyglutarate is a metabolite produced under physiologic conditions but also by tumors harboring isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations . Detection is challenging as it must be distinguished from its enantiomer 2 hydroxyglutarate which is also produced in the body but can increase under hypoxic conditions . A chiral gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed which separated enantiomers using a chiral column and quantified levels using a stable isotope internal standard . The assay improves upon current methods by avoiding chiral derivatization and implementing a simplified sample extraction procedure . The assay was validated and serum 2 hg levels from healthy patients were measured establishing a new comprehensive reference range for normal levels of each enantiomer . Differences in basal levels were observed between races but not sex . Age also correlated with S 2 hg levels but not R 2 hg levels . Finally serum levels of 2 hg enantiomers were measured in a pilot study of 11 patients with and without IDH mutant gliomas . An increase in R 2 hg levels was observed in 2 3 patients with actively growing IDH mutant gliomas . S 2 hg levels were increased in 4 11 patients irrespective of IDH status . The results presented demonstrate the feasibility of a GCMS MS assay for measurement of 2 hg enantiomer levels for clinical use .

1773,Vitamin D plays a vital role in successful pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and fetus . Vitamin D is bound to vitamin D binding protein in blood and is carried to the liver kidneys and other target tissues . Accurate measurements of the clinically measured metabolite of vitamin D 25 hydroxyvitamin D D depend on complete removal from the binding protein . It has been found that VDBP concentrations increase in maternal serum during pregnancy obfuscating the accuracy of 25D concentration measurements in pregnant women . Additionally measurements of VDBP concentrations during pregnancy have been performed using immunoassays which suffer from variations due to differences in antibody epitopes making clinical comparisons difficult . Quantification of VDBP is also of interest because changes in VDBP expression levels may indicate negative outcomes during pregnancy such as preterm delivery and restricted fetal growth . To address the need for accurate measurement of VDBP during pregnancy a method using liquid chromatography isotope dilution mass spectrometry was developed to quantify VDBP using isotopically labeled peptides as internal standards . This method was used to quantify VDBP in Standard Reference Material 1949 Frozen Human Prenatal Serum which was prepared from separate serum pools of women who were not pregnant and women during each trimester of pregnancy . VDBP concentrations were found to be lowest in the serum pool from non pregnant women and increased in each trimester . These data had good repeatability and were found to be suitable for reference value assignment of VDBP in SRM 1949 .
1774,The accurate measurement of androstenedione in human serum and plasma is required for steroid profiling to assure the appropriate diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyperandrogenism .

The performance of the procedure enables its use in the evaluation and standardization of routine assays and for the evaluation of patient samples to ensure the traceability of individual patient results . As the primary standard a certified reference material from NMIA was used . Additionally a quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance method was developed for the value assignment of the primary reference material which ensures the direct traceability to SI units as well as the independence from the availability of reference materials .
1775,LCMS MS allows for many measurands monitoring different mass transitions simultaneously . So far such alternative mass transitions are usually assessed as quantifier and qualifier ions in order to rule out interferences in individual samples . However quantification can also be based on assessment of alternative mass transitions for both the measurand and its internal standard with two distinct results for one injection of an individual sample . These paired results can be averaged . The aim of this study was to determine the potential impact of this averaging approach on measurement imprecision . We studied the impact of averaging results from different transitions for four exemplary measurands piperacillin voriconazole ethylglucuronide . Intra batch studies were performed with 21 injections of single clinical samples in sequence for each analyte and a between batch study with evaluation of data from routine QC samples from 20 series over 20weeks . CVs and their confidence intervals were assessed comparatively for quantification based on single transitions and for averaged results from these two transitions respectively . In all data sets we observed lower CVs for the averaged results compared to the results obtained from single mass transitions . CVs from averaged results were up to 39.4 lower compared to the CVs observed for results obtained from single transitions for the respective measurands . Averaging of quantification results obtained from separate mass transitions acquired simultaneously in ID LC MS MS seems to have the potential to minimize the measurement imprecision for different measurands in short and long term settings .
1776,Carbapenemase producing organisms are a growing threat to human health . Among the enzymes conferring antibiotic resistance produced by these organisms The objective of this study is to develop an intact protein mass spectrometry based method for detection and differentiation of clinically relevant KPC variants directly from bacterial cell lysates . The method should be specific for any variant expressed in multiple bacterial species limit false positive results and be rapid in nature to directly influence clinical outcomes . Lysates obtained directly from bacterial colonies were used for intact protein detection using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . Bottom up and top down proteomic methods were used to characterize the KPC protein targets of interest . Comparisons between KPC producing and KPC non producing isolates from a wide variety of species were also performed . Characterization of the mature KPC protein revealed an unexpected signal peptide cleavage site preceding an AXA signal peptide motif modifying the molecular weight of the mature protein . Taking the additional AXA residues into account allowed for direct detection of the intact protein using top down proteomic methods . Further validation was performed by transforming a KPC harboring plasmid into a negative control strain followed by MS detection of the KPC variant from the transformed cell line . Application of this approach to clearly identify clinically relevant variants among several species is presented for KPC 2 KPC 3 KPC 4 and KPC 5 . Direct detection of these enzymes contributes to the understanding of occurrence and spread of these antibiotic resistant organisms . The ability to detect intact KPC variants via a simple LC MS MS approach could have a direct and positive impact on clinical therapy by providing both direction for epidemiological tracking and appropriate therapy .
1777,Most diseases involve a complex interplay between multiple biological processes at the cellular tissue organ and systemic levels . Clinical tests and biomarkers based on the measurement of a single or few analytes may not be able to capture the complexity of a patients disease . Novel approaches for comprehensively assessing biological processes from easily obtained samples could help in the monitoring treatment and understanding of many conditions . We propose a method of creating scores associated with specific biological processes from mass spectral analysis of serum samples . A score for a process of interest is created by identifying mass spectral features associated with the process using set enrichment analysis methods and combining these features into a score using a principal component analysis based approach . We investigate the creation of scores using cohorts of patients with non small cell lung cancer melanoma and ovarian cancer . Since the circulating proteome is amenable to the study of immune responses which play a critical role in cancer development and progression we focus on functions related to the host response to disease . We demonstrate the feasibility of generating scores their reproducibility and their associations with clinical outcomes . Once the scores are constructed only 3L of serum is required for the assessment of multiple biological functions from the circulating proteome . These mass spectrometry based scores could be useful for future multivariate biomarker or test development studies for informing treatment disease monitoring and improving understanding of the roles of various biological functions in multiple disease settings .
1778,In tandem mass spectrometry analyte detection is based on collision induced fragmentation which is modulated by the collision energy setting . Variation in CE leads to differential ion yield and optimization is usually performed empirically as tuning during method development . Our aim was to build a method to objectify the impact of collision energy settings on ion yield for individual compounds . Collision energy breakdown curves were generated based on acquisition files in which a large number of quasi identical mass transitions were recorded simultaneously with variation of CE over a defined range within a single injection . Ion yield was plotted as a curve versus CE settings . Piperacillin and testosterone were studied as exemplary analytes in matrix free and serum matrix based liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry measurements . More detailed testosterone CE breakdown curves were investigated with regard to sample preparation techniques and the isotope labeling pattern of corresponding internal standards . CE breakdown curves were found characteristically for the piperacillin quantifier transition with respect to CE related maximum ion yield as well as curve width and shape . A diverging curve profile was observed for the piperacillin qualifier transition . For testosterone analyses no impact from different sample preparation techniques or the isotope labeling patterns on the selected CE was shown . CE breakdown curves are a convenient and valuable tool to verify LC MS MS methods regarding consistent fragmentation characteristics between sample sources or native analytes and isotope labeled counterparts .
1779,The opioid crisis is linked to an increased misuse of fentanyl as well as fentanyl analogs that originate from the illicit drug market . Much of our current understanding of fentanyl and fentanyl analog use in our communities comes from postmortem toxicology findings . In the clinical settings of addiction medicine and pain management where the opioid abuse potential is high the use of fentanyl as well as specific fentanyl analogs may be underestimated due to limited plasma testing and limited availability of assays with suitable analytical sensitivity and selectivity to detect misuse of fentanyls . We report plasma and blood assays for 17 fentanyls in clinical and medical examiner casework . A mixed mode solid phase extraction of diluted plasma or precipitated blood was optimized for maximum recovery of the fentanyls with minimized matrix effects . Analysis was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I Class interfaced with a Waters Xevo TQ S micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer . Method parameters were optimized and validated for precision accuracy carryover linearity and matrix effects . Application studies were performed in postmortem blood obtained in 44 fentanyl related fatalities and in serial plasma samples from 18 surgical patients receiving intravenous fentanyl therapy while undergoing parathyroidectomy . Fentanyls found in postmortem cases included fentanyl norfentanyl despropionyl fentanyl beta hydroxy fentanyl acetyl fentanyl acetyl norfentanyl methoxyacetyl fentanyl furanyl fentanyl cyclopropyl fentanyl and para fluorobutyryl fentanyl with fentanyl norfentanyl 4 ANPP and OH fentanyl predominating in frequency . Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 56ng mL and fentanyl was nearly always found with 4 ANPP norfentanyl and OH fentanyl . Concentrations of other fentalogs ranged from 1 to 84ng mL . In the surgical cases fentanyl was detected and quantified along with norfentanyl and OH fentanyl but without detection of 4 ANPP in any of the samples . The association and relative concentrations of OH fentanyl fentanyl and norfentanyl in the postmortem and clinical studies indicated a metabolic rather than an illicit source of OH fentanyl .
1780,The development of non invasive screening techniques for early cancer detection is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century . One promising emerging method is the analysis of volatile organic compounds . VOCs are low molecular weight substances generated as final products of cellular metabolism and emitted through a variety of biological matrices such as breath blood saliva and urine . Urine stands out for its non invasive nature availability in large volumes and the high concentration of VOCs in the kidneys . This review provides an overview of the available data on urinary VOCs that have been investigated in cancer focused clinical studies using mass spectrometric techniques . A literature search was conducted in ScienceDirect Pubmed and Web of Science using the keywords Urinary VOCs VOCs biomarkers and Volatile cancer biomarkers in combination with the term Mass spectrometry . Only studies in English published between January 2011 and May 2020 were selected . The three most evaluated types of cancers in the reviewed studies were lung breast and prostate and the most frequently identified urinary VOC biomarkers were hexanal dimethyl disulfide and phenol with the latter seeming to be closely related to breast cancer . Additionally the challenges of analyzing urinary VOCs using MS based techniques and translation to clinical utility are discussed . The outcome of this review may provide valuable information to future studies regarding cancer urinary VOCs .
1781,Hypertension disproportionately affects African American communities . This interdisciplinary group education curriculum aimed to improve hypertension knowledge behavioral risk factors weight and blood pressure in an urban African American population with uncontrolled hypertension . Outcomes were assessed with paired t tests in a pre post study design . Participants demonstrated a significant increase in hypertension knowledge . Among self reported health behaviors maintaining a healthy weight improved significantly . Participants demonstrated significant weight loss at one month compared to baseline and trended towards significance at three and six months . Participants baseline BP was 165 88mmHg . Decreases in systolic BP trended towards significance at one month and decreased significantly at three months and six months . Diastolic BP significantly decreased at one month and six months and trended towards significance at three months . This interdisciplinary group education intervention shows promise for improving hypertension management in African American populations .
1782,In the past two decades the implementation of the electronic health record system has been one of the most significant changes to patient care and service delivery in healthcare settings . Interprofessional practice and EHR s complement each other and are instrumental to providing better care . At a pediatric rehabilitation hospital in Ontario Canada an electronic health record project was successfully implemented to strengthen interprofessional care . A focus group was held with eight professional regulatory colleges to build a common understanding of the standards and risks of liability related to interprofessional documentation in the healthcare record . Drawing on literature Ontario legislation and the lessons learned from this focus group the case study that emerges aims to assist students and healthcare professionals in understanding the imperative to engage in interprofessional practice from a regulatory and legislative perspective . This report identifies the challenges associated with developing and implementing this EHR project within the context of a pediatric hospital . The key lessons learned from this experience are presented here to offer students clinicians and management a practical demonstration of how regulatory bodies can join the conversation about interprofessional collaboration as well as offer a preliminary framework for interprofessional documentation in healthcare settings .
1783,Several examples illustrate the effectiveness of using Deep Eutectic Solvents as environmentally responsible reaction media in polar organometallic chemistryand in metal catalysed and biocatalysed processes in place of conventional often hazardous volatile organic compounds . Apart from the standpoint of greenness applications of DESs in the aforementioned fields also reveal novel aspects of reactivity of practical significance which are worthy of an in depth mechanistic understanding metal mediated organic transformations can be run in DESs competitively with protonolysis often at room temperature and under air metal catalysed reactions proceed efficiently and under milder conditions in DESs than in VOCs with the catalyst and DES being easily and successfully recycled and biocatalysts often exhibit higher stability selectivity and performances in DES mixtures than in aqueous solutions as well as a somewhat intriguing stereoselectivity .
1784,Through selected examples we report here that ultrasound is capable of assisting a solid catalyst in various reactions . Beside improvement of heat and mass transfer induced by the implosion of cavitation bubbles we show that a synergistic effect can occur between catalysis and ultrasound . In particular the physical and chemical effects locally exerted on a catalytic surface upon implosion of cavitation bubbles can oxidize metal ions provide energy to the catalyst reaction
1785,Hydrodeoxygenation is one of the important catalytic reactions for the conversion of biomass related substrates to value added fuels and chemicals because the value added products tend to have much lower oxygen contents than the substrates . The combination of noble metals with cations and or oxides of oxophilic metal species has been frequently reported to be very effective catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation and CO hydrogenolysis . The interaction between two components can be strongly dependent on the combination the molar ratio the support materials and so on which can be connected to high catalytic performance . The comparison of various catalysts can contribute to the future catalyst design .
1786,Pillared interlayered clays are materials that show a two dimensional layered porous structure with properties that could be interesting alternatives to zeolites and other microporous solids . Some of the properties that make these materials interesting arespecific surface area high exchange capacity low permeability swelling ability relatively good heat resistance stability high acidic properties and relatively low price . PILCs have attracted intense research among several years in relation to the possible control of these properties and environmental applications . The current short work is devoted to the tendencies and new insights in to the last five years of PILCs as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts .

The waste valorization design of new more efficient catalysts the improvement of characteristics by genetic engineering organisms and the development of new and or step integration processes among other possibilities are important tools to increase and make more relevant the role of renewable fuels in the global energy matrix .
1788,Circular economy and electronic waste are among today s hot topics for scientists environmentalists and even policymakers . A considerable fraction of e waste is waste printed circuit boards which contains a wide range of metals ceramics and polymers . This variety of substances has made the recycling of WPCB an interesting challenge . Recently there have been trends to not only recover WPCB into raw materials but also add extra value to final products by transforming the products into nanomaterials catalysts composites etc . In this article first a practical model for adding value through recycling processes is defined that is the valorization model . Second the recent studies that offered functional commodities extracted from WPCB with an average value higher than traditional recycling methods are reviewed and compared to conclude a future projection for WPCB valorization .
1789,Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have brought the need to make the nanoparticles preparation friendlier to the environment . The great variety of applications involving magnetite nanoparticles justifies a growing need for greener synthetic routes . A green approach for preparing nanoparticles is based on the use of plant extracts . In this minireview the current plant mediated strategies for preparing magnetite nanoparticles are briefly described and the main features of the obtained nanoparticles . The advantages and drawbacks of using those procedures are also highlighted .
1790,Traditionally rural areas are locations where food and feed are predominantly produced . Nowadays farmers are also converting biogenic resources such as biomass and biowaste into bioenergy which creates an additional income . The biologization of the economy relies not only on food feed or bioenergy productionbut also on a holistic use of the potential of biogenic resources . It remains however to be shown whether rural areas also properly materially use biogenic resources which requires special knowledge in pretreatment conversion and downstreaming to obtain pure products of choice and create high value . This contribution sheds light on the chances and challenges foodfeedmaterialfuel competition coming along with the biologization of the economy of rural areas .
1791,Existing waste oriented bioeconomy approaches do not always account for the additional environmental impact caused by the treatment itself which can be quite high . Search for efficient and sustainable multi cascading bioeconomy solutions dealing with residues are calling for holistic impact assessment which should include accounting for potential rebound effects and indirect consequences nexuses and interactions with other industries and selection of the specific functionable niches for novel production and processing technologies . This contribution highlights recent environmentally sustainable solutionssuitable for integration in multicascading biowaste treatment approach .
1792,Recently green chemistry for the development of sustainable production systems requires tremendous research efforts on the design of catalysts through resource efficient ways . The improvement of their catalytic performances is a key goal in modern society . Several approaches using environmentally friendly chemicals and materials for less hazardous synthesis and catalysis were analyzed . In this review we focus on the synthesis of nanomaterials and catalytic applications to reduce the environmental impact especially by reducing waste solvents precursors and derivatives . In addition we highlight the special efforts towardthe use of renewable feedstocks and their applications as well as the synthetic routes to develop nanocatalysts using a greener chemistry .
1793,Industry agriculture and residential areas generate increasing volumes of waste streams enriched with organic pollutants . Without proper treatment they threaten the environment but can be valorized with suitable microalgal biotechnologies . Although their development has a long history recent years are marked with a boom of research in this field . This trend is fueled by the transition to circular bioeconomy gaining momentum all over the world . Current trends include the conversion of nutrients including organics nitrogen and especially phosphorus from waste streams to environmentally friendly biofertilizer detoxication of dangerous xenobiotics as well as the implementation of advanced omics methods for monitoring of treatment and designing of robust algalbacterial consortia . Here we review the recent developments highlighting the trends mentioned above .
1794,Hydrothermally carbonized cellulose and its further modifications are intriguing materials for a wide range of potential applications . Hydrothermal carbonization is a sustainable process for converting biopolymers or other biomass sources into carbonaceous materials under mild conditions in water and at relatively low temperatures . This review presents the latest progress in modification and utilization of hydrothermally carbonized cellulose and related materials in environmental biomedical and energy applications . Further applications presented include evaluation of cellulose derived carbon spheres or carbon dots as catalysts antibacterial materials flame retardants and functional fillers in bioplastic composites . The wide range of applications highlights the great potential and multifunctionality of hydrothermally carbonized cellulose and its derivatives . The field is expected to further expand and increase in importance as we move towardcircular bioeconomy .
1795,Methanol is a future energy carrier because of its high volume specific energy density and a significant intermediate for many bulk chemicals . Electrochemical reductionis a promising method to fabricate methanol CH
1796,Among the major challenges of the century reducing the world s dependence on fossil fuels is the most important . In this context several approaches have been considered including the production of lignocellulosic ethanol or second generation bioethanol . After this preprocessing second generation bioethanol is produced using a process involving four primary steps . Different processes of hydrolysis and fermentation are highlighted and then technology trends and barriers to industrial development are commented .
1797,Carbon rich biochar can be produced by pyrolysis of biomass . Depending on the precise production pathway the surface chemistry and porosity can be tuned and made compatible for a defined application . This shear benefit has persuaded researcher to explore its suitability in various electrochemical applications related to energy storage and conversion . In this article we succinctly discuss the potentials of biochar in electrocatalysis fuel cell supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries . We have concluded this article with recommendations for future research .
1798,Flow biocatalysis mainly exploit immobilized enzymes for continuous chemical manufacturing . In the last decade the use of immobilized biocatalysts in flow is growing rapidly yet the immobilization protocols need to be optimized . In this review we have discussed the most fundamental aspects to be considered when designing immobilized enzymes for productive and stable operations in flow . Furthermore we analyze the protein loading the activity recovery the space time yield the specific productivity and the turnover number as complementary metrics to assess the efficiency and longevity of immobilized enzymes integrated into flow reactors . The science of the immobilization implies the engineering of the surfaceprotein interface the material features and the reactor design to achieve highly active and robust heterogeneous biocatalysts under continuous operations . Hence we encourage the flow biocatalysis community to accompany those engineering efforts with accurate assessments of both activity and stability .
1799,The palladium catalyzed Heck arylation of olefins using arenediazonium salts known as the HeckMatsuda reaction constitutes an effective green and sustainable way to synthesize functionalized aryl intermediates for organic synthesis . The present review highlights this strategy focusing on some selected examples from our laboratory . The examples include the substrate directed arylation of olefins covalent and noncovalent strategies and their application in the total syntheses of many pharmacologically active compounds commercial drugs and or functional compounds .
1800,Heteropolycompounds especially heteropolyacids have received important attention as solid acid catalysts in recent decades . They have a strong Brnsted acidity and redox properties that make them important for the study of transformations of industrial and academic interest . To go toward suitable synthesis heterogeneous catalysts are currently being developed with especial focus on these materials . The design of catalysts for biomass conversion entails important challenges from the point of view of carbohydrate feedstock complexity and to develop environmentally friendly methods . This minireview aims to illustrate a number of very recent examples that show the significant potential of the heteropolycompounds in feedstock valorization and the transformation of some building blocks in multicomponent reactions .
1801,The use of plastic in daily life is growing at expressive rates . Because of its inherent characteristics such as chemical resistance and low biodegradability plastic waste is already a global issue . Traditionally used methods for plastic conversion such as incineration cause some environmental concerns besides not being economically attractive . Subcritical and supercritical water provide a strongly oxidant environment which can deal with this waste by allowing the obtention of high added value products from waste of synthetic polymers . These processes when carefully optimized using chemometric methods produce fuels and even the initial monomers that can be used for polymer synthesis reducing the direct demand for fossil raw materials in a circular economy approach .
1802,Food waste reduction is fundamental for sustainable development and pursuing this goal recycling and the valorization of used cooking oil can play a major contribution . Although it has been traditionally used for biofuelproduction the oleochemical potential of UCOs is vast . UCOs can be used as feedstock for a large variety of value added green chemicals including plasticizers binders epoxides surfactants lubricants polymers biomaterials and different building blocks . Thus UCOtransformation into functional chemicals can bring long term stability to the supply chain avoiding the current dependence on commodity products . In this regard this work describes some of the potential benefits of using UCOs as feedstock in oleochemical biorefineries . In addition some of the most recent investigations on the valorization of UCOs other than biofuel are presented . Finally major challenges and future directions are discussed .
1803,Cell free enzymatic transformations can overcome some of the limitations of whole cell biocatalysis . While flow chemistry has matured into an established discipline in organic synthesis its use in cell free biocatalysis is just beginning to be explored . Here we review examples of recent advancements between 2018 and 2020 . We particularly focus on enzyme immobilization and cofactor recycling as these are two major research focuses in this field . This review also provides perspective on future directions .
1804,Research on furfural and 5 furfural concerns all fields of chemistry catalysis mechanistic studies synthetic organic chemistry materials sciences and chemical engineering . The purpose of this account is by picking a selection of the very recent literature to show the vitality of the field and to illustrate how transdisciplinary approaches can help overcoming the strong overlap between catalysts solvent and process issues . It highlights the necessity to encourage researches in two main directions one being the optimization of the access to industrially relevant targets and the second being the commitment of synthetic organic chemists to explorative studies on new reactions and new architectures .
1805,Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in the last two decades and as a major greenhouse gas it has been linked to global warming and climate changes . Capture and conversion of CO
1806,This review deals with the problem of designing safer solvents for chemical transformation and chemical processes . These materials generically defined as neoteric solvents include the well known ionic liquids and more recently deep eutectic solvents . Super critical fluids also pertain to this class but we will restrict our review to the former IL and DES . The main object of this study is the description of properties of these solvents at a molecular level . Both IL and DES share a huge combinatorial flexibility leading to a formidable number of new solvents that can be prepared and it is in this line that theory may help . This is because most of the binding properties to a wide variety of solutes may conveniently be described in terms of the electronic structure of matter using quantum mechanical models classical molecular dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics . The theoretical approach helps in the task of identifying and predicting optimal structures for specific applications .
1807,A current fossil resourcebased world economy is in translation to a sustainable biobased model which requires a replacement of nonrenewable resources with the renewable ones . The lignocellulosic biomass because of its abundance and availability around the globe is one of the most important renewable sources of carbon on Earth . Here we discuss recent discoveries and studies of the molecular mechanisms of the enzymes used in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis valorization and transformation into biofuels and sustainable materials . Special attention is given to progress in enzymatic hydrolysis of recalcitrant plant polysaccharides by glycoside hydrolases and their oxidation by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases as well as to application of those enzymes for the production of nanoparticles and nanomaterials .
1808,Bioethanol and biodiesel are the most important biofuels worldwide . Although the production processes of these two biofuels are well established there is still room for improvements . The integration of these two processes would allow the use of their wastes or by products for increasing productivity or generating additional products . This would make it possible to improve the economics and sustainability of both processes . This article presents an overview focusing on a soybean biodiesel plant integrated into a sugarcane biorefinery . The process integration was evaluated considering agricultural logistic geographic industrial process stream equipment administrative and commercial aspects . The integrated plant offers the opportunity for cost effective and environmentally friendly biofuels processing while expanding the portfolio of potential products .
1809,Urban systems are embedded within and thereby reliant upon the complex systems of their surrounding watersheds . Building the freshwater resilience of urban systems therefore hinges on building the freshwater resilience of the larger human hydrological systems within which they are nested . This consideration creates a system of feedbacks and tradeoffs which are critical to the resilience of the system as well as complex to manage from both hydrological and institutional perspectives . There are few pragmatic examples within the literature of how to plan for freshwater resilience in urban hydrological systems . This article shows an example of the freshwater resilience planning and investment prioritization process for the water supply of Mexico City and the surrounding supply systems .
1810,Resilience is a topic of extensive academic discourse as its relevance is elevated in response to climate change . There is limited research into the concept of resilience from the perspective of those in fields of practice . To address this gap we conducted fieldwork in four cities to ask for perspectives on what enables cities to cope with water related shocks and stresses . Based on analysis of interview responses and focus group discussions we propose key characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity necessary for urban water resilience . We discuss findings in the context of evidence gathered in the field and prevalent work in current water resilience literature . It is our hope that this work may provide insights into the critically important human dimensions necessary for a shift towards resilience as a prevailing paradigm for urban water management .
1811,Flood risk management has proven successful at reducing the threat of some flooding hazards preventing loss of life during flooding events and easing the economic burden to communities and regions following floods . It is a useful approach for assessing risks and guiding decisions on implementing protection measures . Recently in addition to flood risk management flood resilience is discussed as a new approach in academic literature . This contribution tries to unravel the relation between flood risk management and flood resilience . Therefore three aspects are discussed the definition of resilience its measurement methods and also its possible implementation and embedding in flood risk management .
1812,Current water infrastructure designs and design processes are ill suited to address deep uncertainties related to climate variability and change . Water systems increasingly exhibit fragility to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions . The concept of resilience offers a framework to improve water system design for uncertain futures by incorporating capabilities such as persistence adaptability and transformability . Existing formalizations of resilience in engineering design however are dependent on assumptions of climate and hydrologic stationarity and of well characterized uncertainty rendering them obsolete relative to our current understanding of the uncertainties we face . In this paper we use methods based on decision making under deep uncertainty to establish a methodology to design for the resilience of water systems . The formulation generates water system design options that provide resilience capabilities at least cost and specify the optimal choices for persistence adaptability and transformability for performance over a wide range of possible futures . As it was developed for application beyond water systems the Resilience by Design is a generalizable approach offering important new methods of planning and managing for the resilience of critical infrastructure .
1813,After the Central Asian republics became independent in 1991 the transformation process challenged water governance arrangements at all levels . Analysis of transboundary water governance has mainly found that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict . Much research is driven by the question how global concepts like IWRM or good water governance are implemented in the context of Central Asia studies reveal how their inherent ideas of participation and transparency clash with local realities . Only few authors have focussed on national water governance . Their studies show how powerful actors either resist reforms or use them to secure or enhance their positions . A genuine focus on region specific forms of water governance as well as on national politics is underrepresented in the literature which is explained with funding policies and the restrictions of the authoritarian political regimes .
1814,Central Asia is characterized by a continental climate and a pronounced inter annual variability of precipitation and discharge . In the past hydro climatological droughts led to serious water shortages resulting in crop shortfalls significant economic loss and inter state political tensions . Robust forecasts of anomalous climatic and hydrological conditions may reduce regional vulnerability to hydro climatic extremes and thus can serve as a scientific basis for national and trans national water management . Based on a synthesis of international literature and on our decadal long experience in the region we systematically review the scientific progress in seasonal forecasting and evaluate the potential for a scientifically informed water management . Additionally we discuss to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer . Our review shows that exceptionally skillful discharge forecasts for the agricultural relevant vegetation season can be derived by means of statistical models taking remote sensing based estimations of the snow coverage in the Central Asian mountain regions as independent covariates . The consideration of global climate indices in particular El Nio allows to extend the forecast lead times . However decision makers are often not aware of the scientific progress and its implications for improved water management . Despite the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and capacity development modernization at Central Asian water management institutions is proceeding slowly . A continuous engagement in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels appears necessary in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector .
1815,We reviewed the nature range and extent of literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the Circumpolar North . We used a systematic process to identify and synthesize articles . While the number of climate water health articles increased recently this topic remains under studied despite the transformational changes that the Circumpolar North has already experienced due to climate change . Of the climate focused articles most considered climate change to a major extent and discussed waterborne infections . Research examining and evaluating adaptation options and future impacts at the climate water health nexus is absent in the Circumpolar North . Responding to this research gap should become a top priority for research given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies actions and interventions .
1816,Anthropocentrism poses two major challenges to American stormwater management . First the conviction that runoff is a threat to human health and property promotes the construction of storm sewers to rapidly remove runoff from cities with consequent significant deleterious ecosystem effects . Second the pastoral aesthetic preference prompts the dissatisfaction with low impact development that aims to effectively and sustainably manage stormwater because of its unkempt appearance . The 1987 National Pollution Discharge Elimination System initiated a regulatory framework that not only considered human wellbeing but ecological health thereby instigating a challenge to anthropocentrism . With Phase I and Phase II the NPDES stormwater program explicitly include specific measures to regulate stormwater discharges and promote the implementation and appreciation of LID . The advance of American stormwater regulations therefore manifests the intention to attenuate the anthropocentrism impeding the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management moving the country toward ecocentricism and environmental sustainability .
1817,Water availability mediates rural and urban development through impacts on sectors such as agriculture and industry . Recognising that climatic risks attenuate this water availability various adaptation options have been implemented in the water sector . To inform adaptation prioritisation it is critical to assess the growing literature on adaptation options related to water management and synthesise lessons on which options are feasible and under what conditions . We assess the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in the water sector at the global scale using two examples strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in rural areas and sustainable water management in urban areas . To contextualise the assessment and showcase how adaptation feasibility is regionally differentiated we present two case studies flood management in Jakarta and Rotterdam and community based watershed management in India and the Dry Corridor of Central America specifically Guatemala and Honduras . The assessment highlights that while improving irrigation efficiency is technically feasible and has economic benefits it is constrained by issues of replicability and trade offs across scale and institutional barriers . In urban areas flood management measures are technologically and geophysically feasible but barriers such as inadequate institutional capacities constrain their feasibility . We also assess mitigation and sustainable development synergies and trade offs for the two adaptation options . The findings on factors constraining adaptation feasibility in the water sector are useful for policymakers who are increasingly faced with a diverse suite of adaptation choices .
1818,Snow glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes . Monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the Global Climate Observing System . Under ongoing climate change the implication of altering meltwater released by snow ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of Central Asia . These changes will affect the livelihood particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream . A degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio hydrological interactions . For successful mitigation the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere and secondly by providing well calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output . This information is a pre condition to reduce on mid to long term the vulnerability of the local population .
1819,This paper presents a research project spanning over 15years dealing with territorial resilience to flooding . This paper presents a global retrospective view on how research on the concept of resilience began with a primary focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks . These infrastructures are always identified by experts as an aggravating factor leading to territorial systems disruptions . The focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks served as an important first step to improve knowledge on mechanism failures and their impacts on communities . However this first step was insufficient in providing more resilient systems and territories to floods . Today other approaches are useful for implementing strategies of resilience to answer city managers needs such as organizational strategies including participative tools . Long term resilience is addressed within this research for territorial resilience monitoring and planning . This article is primarily based and illustrated on the research projects and scientific advances conducted by the authors .
1820,The aim of uterus transplantation is to treat uterine factor infertility due to absence of a functional uterus . This review provides information on key research findings in the field of uterus transplantation . The animal based preclinical uterus transplantation research started around 20 years back with systematic research in several animal species including non human primates . This research investigated important aspects such as surgery immunosuppression ischemia reperfusion injury rejection and fertility . In 2013 the first clinical uterus transplantation trial started and this was a live donor trial including nine transplantations . The first live birth was reported in 2014 and this has been followed by several more births from the initial trial in Sweden but also from other trials . The published uterus transplantations procedures both from live donors and deceased donors will be reviewed in detail . The surgical procedures to harvest a uterus from a live or from a deceased donor have developed and minimal invasive techniques are being introduced in live donor surgery for uterus transplantation . Some modifications of anatomical sites of venous outflows have been introduced . The efficiency of the procedure in terms of surgical success with viable grafts after one month as well as the rate of successful transplantations with live births as the primary endpoint have proven to be high . Uterus transplantation is an experimental clinical procedure that is performed within clinical trials at many centers worldwide . The accumulated research data from these trials will pave the way for establishment of uterus transplantation as a safe and efficient procedure to treat uterine factor infertility .
1821,One of the earliest studies on human pancreas regeneration dates from the beginning of the 1900s when the American pathologist Russel Cecil noted signs of attempted islet regeneration in samples from organ donors with diabetes . A century later the quest is on to enhance the limited regenerative potential of the pancreas in order to develop new therapies for diabetes . While regeneration is incomplete in mammals zebrafish can naturally recover from extreme cell destruction and hyperglycemia by producing new cells . Here we discuss how a unique blend of
1822,Sleeps effect on memory may not become evident for several days or weeks after learning especially for motor skills and schema related learning . Here we propose a potential mechanism which may be underlying the slow enhancement of skills and schemas by examining the biological events which take place during NREM and REM sleep . We suggest that the immediate benefits of sleep are mainly due to reactivation during NREM sleep while the delayed effects are mainly due to plasticity related changes occurring at the molecular cellular and system levels and which require long periods of time to occur . There is increasing evidence that these events may take place preferentially during REM sleep thus shedding further light on the function of this sleep stage .
1823,REM sleep was initially described in mammals and was later found in birds . As the results obtained in reptiles were unconvincing this suggested for years that only homeothermic species have REM sleep . However recent studies in lizards also suggest the presence of two electrophysiological states and provide a better picture of their sleep . Nevertheless due to differences in the expression of these states in two lizard species as well as missing information homology with mammalian REM sleep still could not be established . As ectotherms and homeotherms have very different physiology and neuroanatomy we expect that even if a state like REM sleep exists in ectotherms its phenotypic expression should be different . Therefore we think that a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of REM sleep will come from efforts to examine both the similarities and difference between sleep states in homeotherms and ectotherms .
1824,Memory reactivations occur during different states and behaviours and they may serve a multitude of functions . In this review we summarize differences in content participating brain regions and neuromodulatory milieu of these reactivations . Further we highlight how such differences could lead to the same phenomena of memory reactivation having different possible functions and outcomes such as memory retrieval cellular consolidation and systems consolidation .
1825,In this short review we draw parallels and stress differences between heart regeneration in mice and human from a bioengineering perspective . As the prevailing dogma that the adult heart is completely post mitotic is starting to change there are multiple opportunities for augmenting the limited but definitive turnover of cardiomyocytes to the extent necessary developing clinically relevant modalities for enhancing heart repair . We discuss some of the most promising among these new directions mobilization of paracrine signaling by therapeutic cells cell free therapy of the heart using extracellular vesicles and direct reprograming of endogenous cells . These new directions share the cell free mechanistic approach to heart repair that could be translated into the clinic faster and safer than the traditional cell therapies .
1826,A spinal injury leads to complex reactions by glial immune and other non neural cells . In mammals these reactions are thought to prevent regeneration of axons and neuronal replacement . Here we review recent insights into how different cell types may cooperate to allow functional regeneration in zebrafish .
1827,In mammals including humans the convention defining rapid eye movement sleep also called paradoxical sleep states that it is mainly characterized by a low voltage fast electrocortical rhythms rapid eye movements and a muscle atonia occasionally accompanied by brief distal twitches . When facing sleep pathologies all these criteria are not always met and identifying REM sleep becomes thus a challenge . Here we review such criteria and report the adjustments proposed to identify and measure REM sleep in animal models of sleep pathologies such as REM sleep Behaviour Disorder and narcolepsy type 1 . We also argue that video recordings synchronized to multi parametric polysomnography are mandatory to recognize REM sleep and differentiate it from dissociated states in animal models of sleep disorders .
1828,The human brain contains 100 billion neurons and each neuron can have up to 200 000 connections to other neurons . Recent advancements in neuroscience ranging from molecular studies in animal models to behavioral studies in humans have given us deeper insights into the development of this extraordinarily intricate system . Studies show a complex interaction between biological predispositions and environment while gross neuroanatomy and low level functions develop early prior to receiving environmental inputs functional selectivity is shaped through experience governed by the maturation of local excitatory and inhibitory circuits and synaptic plasticity during sensitive periods early in development . Plasticity does not end with the closing of the early sensitive period the environment continues to play an important role in learning throughout the lifespan . Recent work delineating the cascade of events that initiates controls and ends sensitive periods offers new hope of eventually being able to remediate various clinical conditions by selectively reopening plasticity .

1831,Wolfram syndrome is a rare progressive disorder characterized by childhood onset diabetes mellitus optic nerve atrophy hearing loss diabetes insipidus and neurodegeneration . Currently there is no effective treatment for WS and patients typically die between 30 and 40 years of age . WS is primarily caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the
1832,Being able to pick out particular sounds such as speech against a background of other sounds represents one of the key tasks performed by the auditory system . Understanding how this happens is important because speech recognition in noise is particularly challenging for older listeners and for people with hearing impairments . Central to this ability is the capacity of neurons to adapt to the statistics of sounds reaching the ears which helps to generate noise tolerant representations of sounds in the brain . In more complex auditory scenes such as a cocktail party where the background noise comprises other voices sound features associated with each source have to be grouped together and segregated from those belonging to other sources . This depends on precise temporal coding and modulation of cortical response properties when attending to a particular speaker in a multi talker environment . Furthermore the neural processing underlying auditory scene analysis is shaped by experience over multiple timescales .
1833,Cleft lip and or palate are a split in the lip the palate or both . This results from the inability of lip buds and palatal shelves to properly migrate and assemble during embryogenesis . By extracting primary cells from a cleft patient we aimed at offering a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms and interacting molecules involved in the lip and palate formation and fusion . With Rho GTPases being indirectly associated with cleft occurrence we investigated the role of the latter in both . First whole exome sequencing was conducted in a patient with cleft lip and palate . Primary fibroblastic cells originating from the upper right gingiva region were extracted and distinct cellular populations from two individuals were obtained a control with no cleft phenotype and a patient with a cleft lip and palate . The genetic data showed three candidate variables in

1835,Successful outcomes of cell based therapeutic is highly dependent on quality and quantity of the cells . Epigenetic modifiers are known to modulate cell fates via reprogramming hence it is plausible to use them in enhancing the plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells . In this study we aimed to study the effects of 5 Azacytidine an epigenetic modifier pretreatment on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton s Jelly fates . WJMSCs were pretreated with 5 AzaCR for 24h and subsequently cultured in culture media mixtures . The proliferative and stemness characteristics of the pretreated WJMSCs were assessed through morphological and gene expression analyses . Results showed that cells pretreated with 5M to 20M of 5 AzaCR showed to acquire higher proliferative state transiently when cultured in embryonic mesenchymal stem cell media but not in MSC medium alone and this coincides with significant transitional upregulation of stemness transcription factors . 5 AzaCR pretreatment has potential to confer initial induction of higher state of stemness and proliferation in WJMSCs influenced by the culture media .
1836,Rab35 is a small GTPase that regulates plasma membrane to early endosome vesicular trafficking and mediates actin remodeling to form actin rich cellular structures . While the function of Rab35 in the cellular context has been examined its role during development has not been well studied . In this study we take advantage of the sea urchin s high fecundity external fertilization and transparent embryos to determine the function of Rab35 during development . We found that loss of function of Rab35 results in defects in skeletogenesis and gastrulation which were rescued by co injection of sea urchin
1837,Acute myocardial infarction is a common cause of the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases in the world . Acute MI lead to cardiovascular output after formation of myocardial ischemia and circulatory arrest in coronary heart diseases . However the mechanisms underlying MI injury are poorly understood . We explored the part played by miR 26a in myocardial infarction . Decreased miR 26a expression in H PI3K Akt and JAK STAT signal transduction pathways were found to be regulated through cross talk between miR 26a and PTEN . Furthermore agomiR 26a treatment in MI mouse model considerably suppressed the size of the infarcted regions and improved cardiac activity . MiR 26a expression in MI cardiac tissues was downregulated in response to H
